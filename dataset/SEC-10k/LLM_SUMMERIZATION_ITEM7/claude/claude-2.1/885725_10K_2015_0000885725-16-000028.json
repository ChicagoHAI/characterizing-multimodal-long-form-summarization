MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nAMS Portfolio Acquisition\nOn August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. Total consideration was comprised of $1.616 billion in up-front cash plus related fees and expenses, and a potential additional $50 million in consideration based on 2016 sales. The AMS male urology portfolio is being integrated with our formerly named Urology and Women's Health business, and the joint businesses have become Urology and Pelvic Health.\nFinancial Highlights and Trends\nIn 2015, we generated net sales of $7.477 billion, as compared to $7.380 billion in 2014, an increase of $97 million, or one percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $505 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2015, as compared to 2014. We had no sales related to our divested Neurovascular business in 2015, compared to a reported $4 million in the prior year. Refer to Note C - Divestitures included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on the Neurovascular divestiture. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $606 million, or eight percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase included net sales of approximately $240 million in 2015, but with no prior period related net sales, due to the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer AG (Bayer) and the AMS Portfolio Acquisition.1 Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results.\nOur reported net loss in 2015 was $239 million, or $0.18 per share. Our reported results for 2015 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges; restructuring- and restructuring-related charges; litigation-related charges; pension termination charges; debt extinguishment charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.506 billion, or $1.11 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2015 was $1.267 billion, or $0.93 per share1.\nOur reported net loss in 2014 was $119 million, or $0.09 per share. Our reported results for 2014 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits; restructuring- and restructuring-related charges; litigation-related charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.248 billion, or $0.93 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2014 was $1.129 billion, or $0.84 per share1.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) to those adjusted results considered by management.

The decrease was due to litigation-related payments made during 2015. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total debt of $5.677 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $319 million and working capital of $1.041 billion. We hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy.\nBusiness and Market Overview\nCardiovascular\nInterventional Cardiology\nOur Interventional Cardiology division develops, manufactures and markets technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders. Product offerings include coronary stents, including drug-eluting and bare metal stent systems, balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels, diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. We also offer structural heart products in certain markets, which include a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and a device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation that are at risk for ischemic stroke.\nOur worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products were $2.033 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products decreased $24 million, or one percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $174 million negative impact on our Interventional Cardiology net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $150 million, or seven percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Interventional Cardiology net sales was primarily related to sales of our WATCHMAN\u00ae device following the U.S. commercial launch during the first quarter of 2015 and our Lotus\u2122 Valve System in Europe; along with operational growth in our other cardiology product lines, including our OptiCross\u2122 Coronary Imaging Catheter; our iLab\u00ae Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging System and our Polaris\u00ae Imaging System; drug-eluting stents and our AngioJet\u2122 Thrombectomy product offerings.\nWorldwide sales from our drug-eluting coronary stents were $1.074 billion during 2015, as compared to $1.151 billion during 2014, representing a significant portion of our Interventional Cardiology net sales. Our drug-eluting stent systems include our next generation SYNERGY\u2122 Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System and our Promus PREMIER\u2122 Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System, both of which are designed to provide physicians with improved drug-eluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease. SYNERGY\u2122 features an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating, while PREMIER\u2122 features a unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system. We received FDA approval of the SYNERGY\u2122 technology and Japanese regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOur structural heart product offerings include our Lotus\u2122 Valve System, a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and our WATCHMAN\u00ae device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The Lotus\u2122 Valve System consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. In October 2013, we received CE mark approval and launched the Lotus\u2122 Valve System in Europe. In December 2015, full trial enrollment was completed in the REPRISE III clinical trial, which is required to support FDA premarket approval for the Lotus\u2122 Valve System. The WATCHMAN\u00ae Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology (WATCHMAN\u00ae) is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin, and is marketed in CE-mark countries and other international countries, as well as the U.S. following FDA approval in March 2015.\nPeripheral Interventions\nOur Peripheral Interventions (PI) product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease, along with certain products to diagnose and ease various forms of cancer.\nOur worldwide net sales of PI products were $904 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of PI products increased $54 million, or six percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $60 million negative impact on our worldwide PI net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $114 million, or 13 percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide PI net sales was primarily driven by revenues from acquired Bayer products, as well as growth in our core PI franchises, our stent franchise following FDA approval and launch of our Innova\u2122 Vascular self-expanding stent system in the U.S., our interventional oncology franchise and our drug-eluting product franchise.\nOn December 31, 2015, we acquired the interventional radiology portfolio of CeloNova Biosciences (CeloNova). The acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. We believe the CeloNova team and technologies will help advance our position and growth profile within the interventional oncology market.\nOn August 29, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer for $414 million in cash. We believe that this acquisition enhances our ability to offer physicians and healthcare systems a more complete portfolio of solutions to treat challenging vascular conditions. The addition of Bayer's strong commercial organization and innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease. The transaction includes the leading AngioJet\u00ae Thrombectomy System and the Fetch\u00ae 2 Aspiration Catheter, which are used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins, and the JetStream\u00ae Atherectomy System, used in an innovative and fast-growing therapy to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries.\nRhythm Management\nCardiac Rhythm Management\nOur Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, including the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the S-ICD\u00ae System, and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities.\nOur worldwide net sales of CRM products were $1.807 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 24 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of CRM products decreased $105 million, or five percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $117 million negative impact on our CRM net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $12 million, or one percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide CRM net sales was primarily driven by growth in our S-ICD\u00ae\nnet sales following the launch of our next-generation Emblem S-ICD\u00ae system in Europe and the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2015, as well as growth in our international CRM business as we increase market share following recent product launches, partially offset by lower volumes of replacement procedures for our defibrillators due to their longevity and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) sales declines in certain regions due to competitive technology offerings. In addition, our global pacemaker revenue increased on a constant currency basis during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by the continued adoption of the ACCOLADE\u2122 family of pacemakers and cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers, and the Ingevity\u2122 MRI pacing lead.\nThe following are the U.S. and international components of our worldwide CRM net sales:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defibrillator systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pacemaker systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRM products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nElectrophysiology\nOur Electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer\u2122 line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness, and the Rhythmia\u2122 Mapping System, a next-generation, catheter-based, 3-D cardiac mapping and navigation solution designed to help diagnose and treat a variety of arrhythmias.\nOur worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products were $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately three percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products increased $6 million, or two percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $14 million negative impact on our Electrophysiology net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $20 million, or nine percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Electrophysiology net sales was primarily due to increased sales of our Rhythmia\u2122 Mapping System and EP capital products.\nMedSurg\nEndoscopy\nOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products were $1.306 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products decreased $17 million, or one percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $96 million impact on our Endoscopy net sales in 2015 as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $79 million, or six percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Endoscopy net sales was primarily driven by growth across several of our key product franchises, including our biliary device franchise with the launch of the SpyGlass\u2122 DS Direct Visualization System and our AXIOS\u2122 Stent and Electrocautery-Enhanced Delivery System for endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural drainage of pancreatic pseudo cysts; our metal stent franchise driven by our Biliary WallFlex\u00ae product family; and our biopsy and polypectomy franchises, featuring our industry leading products such as forceps and snares.\nIn April 2015, we acquired Xlumena, Inc. (Xlumena), which developed minimally invasive devices for Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) guided transluminal drainage of targeted areas within the gastrointestinal tract, including the AXIOS\u2122 Stent.\nUrology and Pelvic Health\nOur Urology and Pelvic Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and pelvic conditions. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products were $693 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately nine percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products increased $158 million, or 30 percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $35 million impact on our Urology and Pelvic Health net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $193 million, or 36 percent. The year -over-year increase\nin worldwide Urology and Pelvic Health net sales was primarily attributable to revenue of approximately $158 million related to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition along with growth across all of our other global franchises.\nIn August 2015, we completed the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition includes the procurement of leading products for the treatment of a variety of urologic conditions, including the minimally invasive GreenLight XPS\u2122 and HPS\u2122 Laser Therapy Systems for treating BPH, the AMS 700\u2122 Inflatable Penile Prosthesis for treating erectile dysfunction, and the AMS 800\u2122 Urinary Control System for treating male stress urinary incontinence.\nIn May 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fully diluted equity of IoGyn, Inc. (IoGyn). IoGyn has developed the Symphion\u2122 System, a next generation system for hysteroscopic intrauterine tissue removal including fibroids (myomas) and polyps. In March 2014, IoGyn received U.S. FDA approval for the system and in October 2014, we launched the system in the U.S.\nNeuromodulation\nOur Neuromodulation business offers the Precision\u00ae and Precision Spectra\u2122 Spinal Cord Stimulator systems and, in Europe, the Precision Novi\u2122 SCS System, used for the management of chronic pain; and our Vercise\u2122 Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System in Europe for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $501 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately seven percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased $29 million, or six percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $9 million impact on our Neuromodulation net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $38 million, or eight percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Neuromodulation net sales was primarily driven by share gains from our CoverEdge\u2122 32-contact Paddle Lead and continued adoption of the Precision Spectra\u2122 Spinal Cord Stimulator System in the U.S. and increased net sales in Europe driven by our Vercise\u2122 DBS System and sales of the recently launched non-rechargeable Precision Novi\u2122 SCS System.\nEmerging Markets\nAs part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. We define Emerging Markets as including 20 developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors, and our global capabilities. We are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our Emerging Markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Our Emerging Markets revenue grew two percent, as compared to the prior year, and was approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact of 11 percent, net sales in these markets grew 13 percent.\nLitigation Charges\nWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.105 billion in 2015, $1.036 billion in 2014, and $221 million in 2013. See Results of Operations below and Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nNeurovascular Divestiture\nIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.500 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, $10 million during 2012, $30 million during 2013 and the final amount due to us in 2014. After the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker, we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement, and also manufactured and supplied products to Stryker through a supply agreement. These transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013. Our sales related to our divested Neurovascular business have ceased as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. See Results of Operations below and Note C - Divestitures to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nRestructuring Initiatives\nOn an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital, our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. We had one active restructuring program during 2015, our 2014 Restructuring Plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors on October 22, 2013. We substantially completed the activities under the plan during 2015, with the exception of certain actions associated with our plant network optimization strategy, which we expect to be complete by the end of 2016. Additional information can be found in Results of Operations below and Note H - Restructuring-related Activities to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nHealthcare Policies\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. We recorded $78 million in 2015, $72 million in 2014 and $73 million in 2013, within our selling, general and administrative expenses. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. The status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2017 is not clear. We intend to reinvest the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities, and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.\nWe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital's or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.\nAny changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally.\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nWe manage our global businesses on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard internal currency exchange rates held constant for each year.\nThe following table provides our worldwide net sales by global business and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or\nas a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management's use of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 versus 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 versus 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\nCurrency\nBasis\n</td> <td>Constant\nCurrency\nBasis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\nCurrency\nBasis\n</td> <td>Constant\nCurrency\nBasis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interventional Cardiology\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peripheral Interventions\n</td> <td>904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>2,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiac Rhythm Management\n</td> <td>1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electrophysiology\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rhythm Management\n</td> <td>2,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endoscopy\n</td> <td>1,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urology and Pelvic Health\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Neuromodulation\n</td> <td>501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MedSurg\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal Core Businesses\n</td> <td>7,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divested Businesses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O - Segment Reporting to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Growth rates are based on actual, non-rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely. Refer to Executive Summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2015 and 2014 net sales.\nIn 2014, we generated net sales of $7.380 billion, as compared to $7.143 billion in 2013, an increase of $237 million, or three percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $99 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 as compared to 2013 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $54 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $390 million, or six percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $97 million; from our Electrophysiology business of $74 million, primarily due to our acquisition of the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard Inc. in November 2013; from our Endoscopy business of $66 million, and from our Peripheral Interventions business of $56 million.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $5.304 billion in 2015, $5.170 billion in 2014, and $4.969 billion in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 70.9 percent in 2015, as compared to 70.1 percent in 2014 and 69.6 percent in 2013. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit - prior year\n</td> <td>70.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing cost reductions\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Neurovascular divestiture\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales pricing and mix\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory step-up due to acquisition accounting\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impact of foreign currency\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other, including other inventory charges and other period expense\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit - current year\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>70.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in our gross profit margin for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products. In addition, in connection with the accounting for the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, we adjusted acquired inventory from manufacturing cost to fair value. The step-up in value is amortized through gross profit over an average estimated inventory turnover period. In 2015, we recorded increased cost of $36 million associated with the step-up.\nThe increase in our gross profit margin for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs, as well as the positive impacts of lower sales related to our divested businesses, as these sales were at significantly lower gross profit margins. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products and changes in the mix of our product sales.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses\nIn 2015, our SG&A expenses decreased $29 million, or one percent, as compared to 2014, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. This decrease was driven by the impacts of our foreign currency fluctuations and declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.\nIn 2014, our SG&A expenses increased $228 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2013, and were 190 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A increases related to business combinations that we have completed over the last several years, product launches and other commercial and corporate programs, variable employee-related benefits and our expansion efforts in emerging markets, partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nWe remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. In 2015, our R&D expenses increased $59 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2014, and were 60 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The increase was due primarily to investments across all of our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth and increased cost related to recent acquisitions and alliances, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2014, our R&D expenses decreased $44 million, or approximately five percent, as compared to 2013, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease was due primarily to the benefits from our initiatives to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient, as well as the timing of certain R&D programs.\nRoyalty Expense\nIn 2015, our royalty expense decreased $41 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2014, and was 60 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.\nIn 2014, our royalty expense decreased $29 million, or 21 percent, as compared to 2013, and was 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.\nAmortization Expense\nOur amortization expense was $495 million in 2015, as compared to $438 million in 2014, an increase of $57 million or 13 percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired in the AMS Portfolio Acquisition.\nAmortization expense was $438 million in 2014, as compared to $410 million in 2013, an increase of $28 million or seven percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2013 and during 2014.\nAmortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.\nGoodwill & Intangible Asset Impairment Charges\nWe have recorded intangible asset impairment charges, including impairments of in-process research and development, of $19 million in 2015, $195 million in 2014 and $53 million in 2013.\nIn 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $423 million following our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units on January 1, 2013. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2015 and 2014.\nSee Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details related to our goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill impairment charges and intangible asset impairment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.\nContingent Consideration Expense\nWe recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $123 million in 2015, a net benefit of $85 million in 2014 and a net expense of $4 million in 2013. See Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our contingent consideration expense associated with our acquisitions. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nRestructuring-related Activities and Charges\nWe recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plan of $26 million during 2015, $69 million during 2014, and $101 million during 2013. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $57 million during 2015, $48 million during 2014, and $23 million\nduring 2013. Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\n2014 Restructuring Plan\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have recorded total costs of $229 million under the 2014 Restructuring Plan, of which $125 million has been recorded as restructuring charges and the remaining portion has been recorded through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate that the 2014 Restructuring Plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $255 million to $270 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $200 million by the end of 2016. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.\nOther Restructuring Plans\nOur other restructuring plans, including our 2011 Restructuring Plan and our prior year Plant Network Optimization Program were substantially completed by the end of 2013.\nWe made cash payments of $95 million in 2015, $112 million in 2014, and $141 million in 2013 associated with our restructuring initiatives.\nSee Note H - Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our restructuring plans and activities.\nLitigation-related Charges and Credits\nWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.105 billion in 2015, $1.036 billion in 2014, and $221 million in 2013. The net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims, the Mirowski lawsuit and certain other items. The net charges recorded in 2014 include a $600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary, Guidant Corporation (Guidant) and Johnson & Johnson signed on February 13, 2015, to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson during 2015. The 2014 net charges also include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and certain other items. These charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our litigation-related matters.\nPension Termination Charges\nWe recorded pension termination charges of $44 million during 2015, which are associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. No pension termination charges were recorded during 2014 and 2013. We do not expect to incur any additional charges in the future related to the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan. The pension termination charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nGain on Divestiture\nIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million during 2014 and a gain of $38 million during 2013 associated with the transaction. These divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense increased to $284 million in 2015, as compared to $216 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to incremental debt to finance the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, offset by savings from the re-financing of our senior notes, along with a pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.000 billion of debt during the second quarter of 2015. Debt extinguishment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Our average borrowing rate was 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of debt extinguishment charges, and 4.8 percent in 2014. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F - Borrowings and Credit\nArrangements to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.\nOur interest expense decreased to $216 million in 2014, as compared to $324 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $70 million of debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of accelerated amortization of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. Our average borrowing rate was 4.8 percent in 2014, as compared to 6.9 percent in 2013, which includes the impact of the debt extinguishment charges.\nOther, net\nOur other, net reflected expense of $39 million in 2015, income of $8 million in 2014, and expense of $19 million in 2013.

During 2014, we recognized gains of $19 million associated with the acquisition of IoGyn, Inc. related to previously held investments and other net gains related to our investment portfolio of $8 million. During 2013, we recognized losses on investments of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. The acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nTax Rate\nThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>76.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of certain receipts/charges*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(64.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(35.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.\nThe change in our reported tax rate for 2015, as compared to 2014 and 2013, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.\nIn 2015, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, litigation- and restructuring-related items, pension termination charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2015 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to settlement of various uncertain tax positions and reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied.\nIn 2014, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, and litigation- and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate for 2014 was also affected by discrete tax items primarily related to resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable court ruling, offset by a charge due to translation gain on previously taxed income.\nIn 2013, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges, litigation- and restructuring-related charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration\nof the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied. Excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the change in our reported tax rate between years is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business and in 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe have received Notices of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. The total incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. In addition to the Notices of Deficiency, during 2014, we received a Revenue Agent Report from the IRS reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the IRS applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax years.\nWe do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, and we have filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the 2001 - 2007 tax years in challenge. We currently expect the trial in this matter to begin in the second half of 2016. Furthermore, we have submitted a letter to the IRS protesting the Revenue Agent Report for the 2008 - 2010 tax years and requesting an administrative appeal hearing. We do not believe that the IRS will hear our appeal until the Tax Court case is concluded.\nNo payments on the net assessments would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of December 31, 2015. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSee Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our tax rate and our tax court disputes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $319 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $118 million invested in money market and government funds and $201 million in short-term time deposits and interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $300 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.\nThe following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(624\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2015, we generated $600 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.269 billion in 2014, a decrease of $669 million or 53 percent. This decrease was primarily due to $600 million of payments to Johnson & Johnson as a result of the settlement agreement signed on February 13, 2015 to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson against Guidant, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant in 2006. As a result of the settlement agreement, Johnson & Johnson agreed to dismiss permanently its action without acknowledgment of liability by Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson.\nDuring 2014, we generated $1.269 billion of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.110 billion in 2013, an increase of $159 million, or 14 percent. This increase was primarily due to reductions in our accounts receivable due to a government funded settlement of outstanding receivables in Spain during 2014 and lower payments related to interest and costs associated with debt extinguishment; partially offset by increases in our inventory levels and higher payments related to contingent consideration.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2015, cash used for investing activities was $2.186 billion. Our investing activities included $1.734 billion of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions, including the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, CeloNova and Xlumena; along with $266 million of payments related to strategic investments, including equity investments in Preventice, Inc. and Frankenman Medical Equipment Company. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $247 million. We intend to invest approximately $350 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2016.\nDuring 2014, cash used for investing activities was $745 million. Our investing activities included $486 million of payments for the acquisitions of IoGyn and the Interventional Division of Bayer, net of cash acquired. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of capital expenditures of $259 million.\nDuring 2013, cash used for investing activities was $475 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $245 million and a $274 million payment for the acquisition of C.R. Bard's electrophysiology business. These expenditures were partially offset by $53 million of proceeds received from the sale of our Natick, Massachusetts headquarters in 2013.\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $156 million of contingent payments in 2015, $34 million of payments in 2014 and $160 million of payments in 2013 associated with our previous acquisitions.\nOur liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk and uncertainties could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans.\nDebt\nWe had total debt of $5.677 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $4.244 billion as of December 31, 2014 which consisted of the following:\nCredit Facilities\nIn April 2015, we entered into a new $2.000 billion revolving credit facility (the 2015 Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous $2.000 billion revolving credit facility. The 2015 Facility matures in April 2020. There were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014.\nWe also maintain a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables maturing on June 9, 2017. We had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTerm Loans\nIn April 2015, we entered into a $750 million, unsecured term loan facility (2015 Term Loan). We had $750 million outstanding under the 2015 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a $400 million, unsecured term loan facility (2013 Term Loan). We had $250 million outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015 and $400 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014.\nOur revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities require that we maintain certain financial covenants as outlined in Note F - Borrowings and Credit Agreements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of and through December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers.\nSenior Notes\nWe had $4.650 billion of senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and $3.800 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Our senior notes are publicly registered securities, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if directly borrowed by our subsidiaries and liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note:\n</td> <td>The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes or debt issuance costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Arrangements\nWe have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $392 million as of December 31, 2015. We de-recognized $151 million of receivables as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 2.4 percent, and $167 million as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 3.2 percent. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 21.000 billion Japanese yen (approximately $175 million as of December 31, 2015). We de-recognized $132 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent and $134 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit of $44 million, as compared to $59 million as of December 31, 2014, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees.\nFor additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facilities, term loans, senior notes and other arrangements, see Note F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nEquity\nDuring 2015 we received $114 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $60 million in 2014 and $74 million 2013. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.\nWe repurchased 10 million shares for $125 million during 2014, and 51 million shares for $500 million during 2013. No share repurchases were made in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nStock-based compensation expense related to our stock equity compensation and ownership plans was $107 million in 2015, $103 million in 2014, and $105 million in 2013. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum royalty obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The amounts in the table above with respect to lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.056 billion the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.\nWith certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects we acquired is between $100 million and $150 million. Net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2016 through 2024, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2015.\nLegal Matters\nFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings see Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management's judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities and Intangible Assets, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.\nSee Note A-Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. In addition, see Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments and Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration; Note J -Income Taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and Note K - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.\nMany of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE\u00ae Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Generally, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nInventory Provisions\nWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.\nWe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable,we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with\nthe carrying value in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.\nGoodwill Valuation\nWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. For our 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units, including Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.\nIn applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units' future expected cash flows.\nIf the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists, we then perform the second step of the goodwill test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value.\nAlthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. As a result of the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test, we identified our global Electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. Also, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent; however, due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years, no goodwill remains within our CRM reporting unit.\nOn a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth\nrates and levels of profitability. Terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC, are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, keeping all other variables constant, a combined increase of 50 basis points in the WACC along with a simultaneous decrease of 150 basis points in the long term growth rate applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global Electrophysiology reporting unit. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in business performance may result in impairment of our goodwill.\nLegal and Product Liability Accruals\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Therefore, judgment is required based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note Q - New Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on Standards Implemented and Standards to be Implemented.\nAdditional Information\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Boston Scientific\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nThe GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.\nManagement uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments' measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.\nWe believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes\u201d of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nThe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - These charges represent (a) non-cash write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during 2015, 2014, and 2013; and (b) a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our global Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013. We remove the impact of non-cash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Acquisition- and divestiture related net charges (credits) - These adjustments consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held investments; (c) purchased and/or funded in-process research and development expenses incurred outside of a business combination; (d) due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs; and (e) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value.

A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. These plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about our company. We disclose details regarding individual Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below.\nThe AMS Portfolio Acquisition\nOn August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. As permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, management has excluded the AMS Portfolio Acquisition from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 as the acquisition was completed in August 2015. We are permitted to omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from our assessment of internal control for up to one year from the acquisition date. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition represents 1% of our total assets and 2% of our total revenues as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>/s/ Michael F.

Boston Scientific Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the subsidiaries and assets of American Medical Systems that were acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation, which are included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Boston Scientific Corporation and constituted approximately 1% of total assets (excluding the goodwill and intangibles which were included in management's assessment of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015) and approximately 2% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Boston Scientific Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the subsidiaries and assets of American Medical Systems that were acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation.\nIn our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 24, 2016", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nAMS Portfolio Acquisition\nOn August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. Total consideration was comprised of $1.616 billion in up-front cash plus related fees and expenses, and a potential additional $50 million in consideration based on 2016 sales. The AMS male urology portfolio is being integrated with our formerly named Urology and Women's Health business, and the joint businesses have become Urology and Pelvic Health.\nFinancial Highlights and Trends\nIn 2015, we generated net sales of $7.477 billion, as compared to $7.380 billion in 2014, an increase of $97 million, or one percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $505 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2015, as compared to 2014. We had no sales related to our divested Neurovascular business in 2015, compared to a reported $4 million in the prior year. Refer to Note C - Divestitures included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on the Neurovascular divestiture. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $606 million, or eight percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase included net sales of approximately $240 million in 2015, but with no prior period related net sales, due to the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer AG (Bayer) and the AMS Portfolio Acquisition.1 Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results.\nOur reported net loss in 2015 was $239 million, or $0.18 per share. Our reported results for 2015 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges; restructuring- and restructuring-related charges; litigation-related charges; pension termination charges; debt extinguishment charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.506 billion, or $1.11 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2015 was $1.267 billion, or $0.93 per share1.\nOur reported net loss in 2014 was $119 million, or $0.09 per share. Our reported results for 2014 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits; restructuring- and restructuring-related charges; litigation-related charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.248 billion, or $0.93 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2014 was $1.129 billion, or $0.84 per share1.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) to those adjusted results considered by management.

The decrease was due to litigation-related payments made during 2015. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total debt of $5.677 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $319 million and working capital of $1.041 billion. We hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy.\nBusiness and Market Overview\nCardiovascular\nInterventional Cardiology\nOur Interventional Cardiology division develops, manufactures and markets technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders. Product offerings include coronary stents, including drug-eluting and bare metal stent systems, balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels, diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. We also offer structural heart products in certain markets, which include a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and a device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation that are at risk for ischemic stroke.\nOur worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products were $2.033 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products decreased $24 million, or one percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $174 million negative impact on our Interventional Cardiology net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $150 million, or seven percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Interventional Cardiology net sales was primarily related to sales of our WATCHMAN\u00ae device following the U.S. commercial launch during the first quarter of 2015 and our Lotus\u2122 Valve System in Europe; along with operational growth in our other cardiology product lines, including our OptiCross\u2122 Coronary Imaging Catheter; our iLab\u00ae Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging System and our Polaris\u00ae Imaging System; drug-eluting stents and our AngioJet\u2122 Thrombectomy product offerings.\nWorldwide sales from our drug-eluting coronary stents were $1.074 billion during 2015, as compared to $1.151 billion during 2014, representing a significant portion of our Interventional Cardiology net sales. Our drug-eluting stent systems include our next generation SYNERGY\u2122 Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System and our Promus PREMIER\u2122 Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System, both of which are designed to provide physicians with improved drug-eluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease. SYNERGY\u2122 features an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating, while PREMIER\u2122 features a unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system. We received FDA approval of the SYNERGY\u2122 technology and Japanese regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOur structural heart product offerings include our Lotus\u2122 Valve System, a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and our WATCHMAN\u00ae device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The Lotus\u2122 Valve System consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. In October 2013, we received CE mark approval and launched the Lotus\u2122 Valve System in Europe. In December 2015, full trial enrollment was completed in the REPRISE III clinical trial, which is required to support FDA premarket approval for the Lotus\u2122 Valve System. The WATCHMAN\u00ae Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology (WATCHMAN\u00ae) is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin, and is marketed in CE-mark countries and other international countries, as well as the U.S. following FDA approval in March 2015.\nPeripheral Interventions\nOur Peripheral Interventions (PI) product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease, along with certain products to diagnose and ease various forms of cancer.\nOur worldwide net sales of PI products were $904 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of PI products increased $54 million, or six percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $60 million negative impact on our worldwide PI net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $114 million, or 13 percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide PI net sales was primarily driven by revenues from acquired Bayer products, as well as growth in our core PI franchises, our stent franchise following FDA approval and launch of our Innova\u2122 Vascular self-expanding stent system in the U.S., our interventional oncology franchise and our drug-eluting product franchise.\nOn December 31, 2015, we acquired the interventional radiology portfolio of CeloNova Biosciences (CeloNova). The acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. We believe the CeloNova team and technologies will help advance our position and growth profile within the interventional oncology market.\nOn August 29, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer for $414 million in cash. We believe that this acquisition enhances our ability to offer physicians and healthcare systems a more complete portfolio of solutions to treat challenging vascular conditions. The addition of Bayer's strong commercial organization and innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease. The transaction includes the leading AngioJet\u00ae Thrombectomy System and the Fetch\u00ae 2 Aspiration Catheter, which are used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins, and the JetStream\u00ae Atherectomy System, used in an innovative and fast-growing therapy to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries.\nRhythm Management\nCardiac Rhythm Management\nOur Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, including the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the S-ICD\u00ae System, and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities.\nOur worldwide net sales of CRM products were $1.807 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 24 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of CRM products decreased $105 million, or five percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $117 million negative impact on our CRM net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $12 million, or one percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide CRM net sales was primarily driven by growth in our S-ICD\u00ae\nnet sales following the launch of our next-generation Emblem S-ICD\u00ae system in Europe and the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2015, as well as growth in our international CRM business as we increase market share following recent product launches, partially offset by lower volumes of replacement procedures for our defibrillators due to their longevity and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) sales declines in certain regions due to competitive technology offerings. In addition, our global pacemaker revenue increased on a constant currency basis during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by the continued adoption of the ACCOLADE\u2122 family of pacemakers and cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers, and the Ingevity\u2122 MRI pacing lead.\nThe following are the U.S. and international components of our worldwide CRM net sales:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defibrillator systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pacemaker systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRM products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nElectrophysiology\nOur Electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer\u2122 line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness, and the Rhythmia\u2122 Mapping System, a next-generation, catheter-based, 3-D cardiac mapping and navigation solution designed to help diagnose and treat a variety of arrhythmias.\nOur worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products were $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately three percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products increased $6 million, or two percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $14 million negative impact on our Electrophysiology net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $20 million, or nine percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Electrophysiology net sales was primarily due to increased sales of our Rhythmia\u2122 Mapping System and EP capital products.\nMedSurg\nEndoscopy\nOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products were $1.306 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products decreased $17 million, or one percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $96 million impact on our Endoscopy net sales in 2015 as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $79 million, or six percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Endoscopy net sales was primarily driven by growth across several of our key product franchises, including our biliary device franchise with the launch of the SpyGlass\u2122 DS Direct Visualization System and our AXIOS\u2122 Stent and Electrocautery-Enhanced Delivery System for endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural drainage of pancreatic pseudo cysts; our metal stent franchise driven by our Biliary WallFlex\u00ae product family; and our biopsy and polypectomy franchises, featuring our industry leading products such as forceps and snares.\nIn April 2015, we acquired Xlumena, Inc. (Xlumena), which developed minimally invasive devices for Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) guided transluminal drainage of targeted areas within the gastrointestinal tract, including the AXIOS\u2122 Stent.\nUrology and Pelvic Health\nOur Urology and Pelvic Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and pelvic conditions. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products were $693 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately nine percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products increased $158 million, or 30 percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $35 million impact on our Urology and Pelvic Health net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $193 million, or 36 percent. The year -over-year increase\nin worldwide Urology and Pelvic Health net sales was primarily attributable to revenue of approximately $158 million related to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition along with growth across all of our other global franchises.\nIn August 2015, we completed the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition includes the procurement of leading products for the treatment of a variety of urologic conditions, including the minimally invasive GreenLight XPS\u2122 and HPS\u2122 Laser Therapy Systems for treating BPH, the AMS 700\u2122 Inflatable Penile Prosthesis for treating erectile dysfunction, and the AMS 800\u2122 Urinary Control System for treating male stress urinary incontinence.\nIn May 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fully diluted equity of IoGyn, Inc. (IoGyn). IoGyn has developed the Symphion\u2122 System, a next generation system for hysteroscopic intrauterine tissue removal including fibroids (myomas) and polyps. In March 2014, IoGyn received U.S. FDA approval for the system and in October 2014, we launched the system in the U.S.\nNeuromodulation\nOur Neuromodulation business offers the Precision\u00ae and Precision Spectra\u2122 Spinal Cord Stimulator systems and, in Europe, the Precision Novi\u2122 SCS System, used for the management of chronic pain; and our Vercise\u2122 Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System in Europe for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $501 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately seven percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased $29 million, or six percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $9 million impact on our Neuromodulation net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $38 million, or eight percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Neuromodulation net sales was primarily driven by share gains from our CoverEdge\u2122 32-contact Paddle Lead and continued adoption of the Precision Spectra\u2122 Spinal Cord Stimulator System in the U.S. and increased net sales in Europe driven by our Vercise\u2122 DBS System and sales of the recently launched non-rechargeable Precision Novi\u2122 SCS System.\nEmerging Markets\nAs part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. We define Emerging Markets as including 20 developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors, and our global capabilities. We are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our Emerging Markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Our Emerging Markets revenue grew two percent, as compared to the prior year, and was approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact of 11 percent, net sales in these markets grew 13 percent.\nLitigation Charges\nWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.105 billion in 2015, $1.036 billion in 2014, and $221 million in 2013. See Results of Operations below and Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nNeurovascular Divestiture\nIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.500 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, $10 million during 2012, $30 million during 2013 and the final amount due to us in 2014. After the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker, we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement, and also manufactured and supplied products to Stryker through a supply agreement. These transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013. Our sales related to our divested Neurovascular business have ceased as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. See Results of Operations below and Note C - Divestitures to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nRestructuring Initiatives\nOn an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital, our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. We had one active restructuring program during 2015, our 2014 Restructuring Plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors on October 22, 2013. We substantially completed the activities under the plan during 2015, with the exception of certain actions associated with our plant network optimization strategy, which we expect to be complete by the end of 2016. Additional information can be found in Results of Operations below and Note H - Restructuring-related Activities to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nHealthcare Policies\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. We recorded $78 million in 2015, $72 million in 2014 and $73 million in 2013, within our selling, general and administrative expenses. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. The status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2017 is not clear. We intend to reinvest the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities, and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.\nWe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital's or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.\nAny changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally.\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nWe manage our global businesses on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard internal currency exchange rates held constant for each year.\nThe following table provides our worldwide net sales by global business and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or\nas a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management's use of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 versus 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 versus 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\nCurrency\nBasis\n</td> <td>Constant\nCurrency\nBasis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\nCurrency\nBasis\n</td> <td>Constant\nCurrency\nBasis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interventional Cardiology\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Peripheral Interventions\n</td> <td>904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>2,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiac Rhythm Management\n</td> <td>1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electrophysiology\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rhythm Management\n</td> <td>2,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endoscopy\n</td> <td>1,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urology and Pelvic Health\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Neuromodulation\n</td> <td>501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MedSurg\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal Core Businesses\n</td> <td>7,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divested Businesses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O - Segment Reporting to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Growth rates are based on actual, non-rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely. Refer to Executive Summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2015 and 2014 net sales.\nIn 2014, we generated net sales of $7.380 billion, as compared to $7.143 billion in 2013, an increase of $237 million, or three percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $99 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 as compared to 2013 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $54 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $390 million, or six percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $97 million; from our Electrophysiology business of $74 million, primarily due to our acquisition of the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard Inc. in November 2013; from our Endoscopy business of $66 million, and from our Peripheral Interventions business of $56 million.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $5.304 billion in 2015, $5.170 billion in 2014, and $4.969 billion in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 70.9 percent in 2015, as compared to 70.1 percent in 2014 and 69.6 percent in 2013. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit - prior year\n</td> <td>70.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing cost reductions\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Neurovascular divestiture\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales pricing and mix\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory step-up due to acquisition accounting\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impact of foreign currency\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other, including other inventory charges and other period expense\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit - current year\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>70.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in our gross profit margin for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products. In addition, in connection with the accounting for the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, we adjusted acquired inventory from manufacturing cost to fair value. The step-up in value is amortized through gross profit over an average estimated inventory turnover period. In 2015, we recorded increased cost of $36 million associated with the step-up.\nThe increase in our gross profit margin for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs, as well as the positive impacts of lower sales related to our divested businesses, as these sales were at significantly lower gross profit margins. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products and changes in the mix of our product sales.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses\nIn 2015, our SG&A expenses decreased $29 million, or one percent, as compared to 2014, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. This decrease was driven by the impacts of our foreign currency fluctuations and declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.\nIn 2014, our SG&A expenses increased $228 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2013, and were 190 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A increases related to business combinations that we have completed over the last several years, product launches and other commercial and corporate programs, variable employee-related benefits and our expansion efforts in emerging markets, partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nWe remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. In 2015, our R&D expenses increased $59 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2014, and were 60 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The increase was due primarily to investments across all of our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth and increased cost related to recent acquisitions and alliances, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2014, our R&D expenses decreased $44 million, or approximately five percent, as compared to 2013, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease was due primarily to the benefits from our initiatives to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient, as well as the timing of certain R&D programs.\nRoyalty Expense\nIn 2015, our royalty expense decreased $41 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2014, and was 60 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.\nIn 2014, our royalty expense decreased $29 million, or 21 percent, as compared to 2013, and was 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.\nAmortization Expense\nOur amortization expense was $495 million in 2015, as compared to $438 million in 2014, an increase of $57 million or 13 percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired in the AMS Portfolio Acquisition.\nAmortization expense was $438 million in 2014, as compared to $410 million in 2013, an increase of $28 million or seven percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2013 and during 2014.\nAmortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.\nGoodwill & Intangible Asset Impairment Charges\nWe have recorded intangible asset impairment charges, including impairments of in-process research and development, of $19 million in 2015, $195 million in 2014 and $53 million in 2013.\nIn 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $423 million following our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units on January 1, 2013. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2015 and 2014.\nSee Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details related to our goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill impairment charges and intangible asset impairment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.\nContingent Consideration Expense\nWe recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $123 million in 2015, a net benefit of $85 million in 2014 and a net expense of $4 million in 2013. See Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our contingent consideration expense associated with our acquisitions. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nRestructuring-related Activities and Charges\nWe recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plan of $26 million during 2015, $69 million during 2014, and $101 million during 2013. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $57 million during 2015, $48 million during 2014, and $23 million\nduring 2013. Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\n2014 Restructuring Plan\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have recorded total costs of $229 million under the 2014 Restructuring Plan, of which $125 million has been recorded as restructuring charges and the remaining portion has been recorded through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate that the 2014 Restructuring Plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $255 million to $270 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $200 million by the end of 2016. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.\nOther Restructuring Plans\nOur other restructuring plans, including our 2011 Restructuring Plan and our prior year Plant Network Optimization Program were substantially completed by the end of 2013.\nWe made cash payments of $95 million in 2015, $112 million in 2014, and $141 million in 2013 associated with our restructuring initiatives.\nSee Note H - Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our restructuring plans and activities.\nLitigation-related Charges and Credits\nWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.105 billion in 2015, $1.036 billion in 2014, and $221 million in 2013. The net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims, the Mirowski lawsuit and certain other items. The net charges recorded in 2014 include a $600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary, Guidant Corporation (Guidant) and Johnson & Johnson signed on February 13, 2015, to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson during 2015. The 2014 net charges also include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and certain other items. These charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our litigation-related matters.\nPension Termination Charges\nWe recorded pension termination charges of $44 million during 2015, which are associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. No pension termination charges were recorded during 2014 and 2013. We do not expect to incur any additional charges in the future related to the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan. The pension termination charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nGain on Divestiture\nIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million during 2014 and a gain of $38 million during 2013 associated with the transaction. These divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense increased to $284 million in 2015, as compared to $216 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to incremental debt to finance the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, offset by savings from the re-financing of our senior notes, along with a pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.000 billion of debt during the second quarter of 2015. Debt extinguishment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Our average borrowing rate was 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of debt extinguishment charges, and 4.8 percent in 2014. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F - Borrowings and Credit\nArrangements to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.\nOur interest expense decreased to $216 million in 2014, as compared to $324 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $70 million of debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of accelerated amortization of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. Our average borrowing rate was 4.8 percent in 2014, as compared to 6.9 percent in 2013, which includes the impact of the debt extinguishment charges.\nOther, net\nOur other, net reflected expense of $39 million in 2015, income of $8 million in 2014, and expense of $19 million in 2013. The following are the components of other, net:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, we recognized net losses on investments of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. During 2014, we recognized gains of $19 million associated with the acquisition of IoGyn, Inc. related to previously held investments and other net gains related to our investment portfolio of $8 million. During 2013, we recognized losses on investments of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. The acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nTax Rate\nThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>76.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of certain receipts/charges*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(64.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(35.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.\nThe change in our reported tax rate for 2015, as compared to 2014 and 2013, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.\nIn 2015, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, litigation- and restructuring-related items, pension termination charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2015 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to settlement of various uncertain tax positions and reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied.\nIn 2014, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, and litigation- and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate for 2014 was also affected by discrete tax items primarily related to resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable court ruling, offset by a charge due to translation gain on previously taxed income.\nIn 2013, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges, litigation- and restructuring-related charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration\nof the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied. Excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the change in our reported tax rate between years is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business and in 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe have received Notices of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. The total incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. In addition to the Notices of Deficiency, during 2014, we received a Revenue Agent Report from the IRS reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the IRS applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax years.\nWe do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, and we have filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the 2001 - 2007 tax years in challenge. We currently expect the trial in this matter to begin in the second half of 2016. Furthermore, we have submitted a letter to the IRS protesting the Revenue Agent Report for the 2008 - 2010 tax years and requesting an administrative appeal hearing. We do not believe that the IRS will hear our appeal until the Tax Court case is concluded.\nNo payments on the net assessments would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of December 31, 2015. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSee Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our tax rate and our tax court disputes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $319 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $118 million invested in money market and government funds and $201 million in short-term time deposits and interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $300 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.\nThe following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(624\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2015, we generated $600 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.269 billion in 2014, a decrease of $669 million or 53 percent. This decrease was primarily due to $600 million of payments to Johnson & Johnson as a result of the settlement agreement signed on February 13, 2015 to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson against Guidant, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant in 2006. As a result of the settlement agreement, Johnson & Johnson agreed to dismiss permanently its action without acknowledgment of liability by Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson.\nDuring 2014, we generated $1.269 billion of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.110 billion in 2013, an increase of $159 million, or 14 percent. This increase was primarily due to reductions in our accounts receivable due to a government funded settlement of outstanding receivables in Spain during 2014 and lower payments related to interest and costs associated with debt extinguishment; partially offset by increases in our inventory levels and higher payments related to contingent consideration.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2015, cash used for investing activities was $2.186 billion. Our investing activities included $1.734 billion of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions, including the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, CeloNova and Xlumena; along with $266 million of payments related to strategic investments, including equity investments in Preventice, Inc. and Frankenman Medical Equipment Company. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $247 million. We intend to invest approximately $350 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2016.\nDuring 2014, cash used for investing activities was $745 million. Our investing activities included $486 million of payments for the acquisitions of IoGyn and the Interventional Division of Bayer, net of cash acquired. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of capital expenditures of $259 million.\nDuring 2013, cash used for investing activities was $475 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $245 million and a $274 million payment for the acquisition of C.R. Bard's electrophysiology business. These expenditures were partially offset by $53 million of proceeds received from the sale of our Natick, Massachusetts headquarters in 2013.\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $156 million of contingent payments in 2015, $34 million of payments in 2014 and $160 million of payments in 2013 associated with our previous acquisitions.\nOur liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk and uncertainties could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans.\nDebt\nWe had total debt of $5.677 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $4.244 billion as of December 31, 2014 which consisted of the following:\nCredit Facilities\nIn April 2015, we entered into a new $2.000 billion revolving credit facility (the 2015 Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous $2.000 billion revolving credit facility. The 2015 Facility matures in April 2020. There were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014.\nWe also maintain a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables maturing on June 9, 2017. We had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTerm Loans\nIn April 2015, we entered into a $750 million, unsecured term loan facility (2015 Term Loan). We had $750 million outstanding under the 2015 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a $400 million, unsecured term loan facility (2013 Term Loan). We had $250 million outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015 and $400 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014.\nOur revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities require that we maintain certain financial covenants as outlined in Note F - Borrowings and Credit Agreements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of and through December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers.\nSenior Notes\nWe had $4.650 billion of senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and $3.800 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Our senior notes are publicly registered securities, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if directly borrowed by our subsidiaries and liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n Note: The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes or debt issuance costs. \nOther Arrangements\nWe have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $392 million as of December 31, 2015. We de-recognized $151 million of receivables as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 2.4 percent, and $167 million as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 3.2 percent. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 21.000 billion Japanese yen (approximately $175 million as of December 31, 2015). We de-recognized $132 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent and $134 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit of $44 million, as compared to $59 million as of December 31, 2014, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees.\nFor additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facilities, term loans, senior notes and other arrangements, see Note F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nEquity\nDuring 2015 we received $114 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $60 million in 2014 and $74 million 2013. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.\nWe repurchased 10 million shares for $125 million during 2014, and 51 million shares for $500 million during 2013. No share repurchases were made in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nStock-based compensation expense related to our stock equity compensation and ownership plans was $107 million in 2015, $103 million in 2014, and $105 million in 2013. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum royalty obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.  The amounts in the table above with respect to lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.056 billion the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.\nWith certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects we acquired is between $100 million and $150 million. Net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2016 through 2024, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2015.\nLegal Matters\nFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings see Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management's judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities and Intangible Assets, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.\nSee Note A-Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. In addition, see Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments and Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration; Note J -Income Taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and Note K - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.\nMany of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE\u00ae Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Generally, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nInventory Provisions\nWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.\nWe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable,we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with\nthe carrying value in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.\nGoodwill Valuation\nWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. For our 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units, including Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.\nIn applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units' future expected cash flows.\nIf the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists, we then perform the second step of the goodwill test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value.\nAlthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. As a result of the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test, we identified our global Electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. Also, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent; however, due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years, no goodwill remains within our CRM reporting unit.\nOn a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth\nrates and levels of profitability. Terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC, are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, keeping all other variables constant, a combined increase of 50 basis points in the WACC along with a simultaneous decrease of 150 basis points in the long term growth rate applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global Electrophysiology reporting unit. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in business performance may result in impairment of our goodwill.\nLegal and Product Liability Accruals\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Therefore, judgment is required based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note Q - New Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on Standards Implemented and Standards to be Implemented.\nAdditional Information\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Boston Scientific\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nThe GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.\nManagement uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments' measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.\nWe believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes\u201d of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nThe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share\n \u2022 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - These charges represent (a) non-cash write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during 2015, 2014, and 2013; and (b) a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our global Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013. We remove the impact of non-cash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. \n \u2022 Acquisition- and divestiture related net charges (credits) - These adjustments consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held investments; (c) purchased and/or funded in-process research and development expenses incurred outside of a business combination; (d) due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs; and (e) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. Due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations. Separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \n \u2022 Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments represent primarily severance and other direct costs associated with our restructuring programs. These costs are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \n \u2022 Litigation-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \n \u2022 Debt extinguishment charges - These charges represent premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.0 billion of public senior notes during the second quarter of 2015 and the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. These adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \n \u2022 Pension termination charges - This item represents charges associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. These charges are not expected to recur after 2015 and do not reflect expected \nongoing operating results. Accordingly, management has excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.\n \u2022 Amortization expense - Amortization expense is a non-cash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the financial covenants included in our credit facility or our term loan facility agreements. Management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. \n \u2022 Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods in conjunction with the purchase accounting for an acquisition or as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges or credits. These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \nRevenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Sales from Divested Businesses and/or Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n \u2022 Sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \nAdjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as the sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans by Executive Officers\nPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. These plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about our company. We disclose details regarding individual Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below.\nThe AMS Portfolio Acquisition\nOn August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. As permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, management has excluded the AMS Portfolio Acquisition from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 as the acquisition was completed in August 2015. We are permitted to omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from our assessment of internal control for up to one year from the acquisition date. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition represents 1% of our total assets and 2% of our total revenues as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>/s/ Michael F.

Boston Scientific Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the subsidiaries and assets of American Medical Systems that were acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation, which are included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Boston Scientific Corporation and constituted approximately 1% of total assets (excluding the goodwill and intangibles which were included in management's assessment of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015) and approximately 2% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Boston Scientific Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the subsidiaries and assets of American Medical Systems that were acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation.\nIn our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 24, 2016", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nAMS Portfolio Acquisition\nOn August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. Total consideration was comprised of $1.616 billion in up-front cash plus related fees and expenses, and a potential additional $50 million in consideration based on 2016 sales. The AMS male urology portfolio is being integrated with our formerly named Urology and Women's Health business, and the joint businesses have become Urology and Pelvic Health.\nFinancial Highlights and Trends\nIn 2015, we generated net sales of $7.477 billion, as compared to $7.380 billion in 2014, an increase of $97 million, or one percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $505 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2015, as compared to 2014. We had no sales related to our divested Neurovascular business in 2015, compared to a reported $4 million in the prior year. Refer to Note C - Divestitures included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on the Neurovascular divestiture. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $606 million, or eight percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase included net sales of approximately $240 million in 2015, but with no prior period related net sales, due to the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer AG (Bayer) and the AMS Portfolio Acquisition.1 Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results.\nOur reported net loss in 2015 was $239 million, or $0.18 per share. Our reported results for 2015 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges; restructuring- and restructuring-related charges; litigation-related charges; pension termination charges; debt extinguishment charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.506 billion, or $1.11 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2015 was $1.267 billion, or $0.93 per share1.\nOur reported net loss in 2014 was $119 million, or $0.09 per share. Our reported results for 2014 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits; restructuring- and restructuring-related charges; litigation-related charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.248 billion, or $0.93 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2014 was $1.129 billion, or $0.84 per share1.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) to those adjusted results considered by management. Refer to Results of Operations for a discussion of each reconciling item:\n\n*Assumes dilution of 21.5 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2015 for all or a portion of these non-GAAP adjustments.\n1 Sales growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net income and net income per share excluding certain items required by GAAP are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Refer to Additional Information in this Item 7 for a discussion of management's use of these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Assumes dilution of 23.7 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2014 for all or a portion of these non-GAAP adjustments.\nCash generated by operating activities was $600 million in 2015, as compared to $1.269 billion in 2014. The decrease was due to litigation-related payments made during 2015. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total debt of $5.677 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $319 million and working capital of $1.041 billion. We hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy.\nBusiness and Market Overview\nCardiovascular\nInterventional Cardiology\nOur Interventional Cardiology division develops, manufactures and markets technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders. Product offerings include coronary stents, including drug-eluting and bare metal stent systems, balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels, diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. We also offer structural heart products in certain markets, which include a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and a device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation that are at risk for ischemic stroke.\nOur worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products were $2.033 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products decreased $24 million, or one percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $174 million negative impact on our Interventional Cardiology net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $150 million, or seven percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Interventional Cardiology net sales was primarily related to sales of our WATCHMAN\u00ae device following the U.S. commercial launch during the first quarter of 2015 and our Lotus\u2122 Valve System in Europe; along with operational growth in our other cardiology product lines, including our OptiCross\u2122 Coronary Imaging Catheter; our iLab\u00ae Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging System and our Polaris\u00ae Imaging System; drug-eluting stents and our AngioJet\u2122 Thrombectomy product offerings.\nWorldwide sales from our drug-eluting coronary stents were $1.074 billion during 2015, as compared to $1.151 billion during 2014, representing a significant portion of our Interventional Cardiology net sales. Our drug-eluting stent systems include our next generation SYNERGY\u2122 Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System and our Promus PREMIER\u2122 Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System, both of which are designed to provide physicians with improved drug-eluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease. SYNERGY\u2122 features an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating, while PREMIER\u2122 features a unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system. We received FDA approval of the SYNERGY\u2122 technology and Japanese regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOur structural heart product offerings include our Lotus\u2122 Valve System, a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and our WATCHMAN\u00ae device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The Lotus\u2122 Valve System consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. In October 2013, we received CE mark approval and launched the Lotus\u2122 Valve System in Europe. In December 2015, full trial enrollment was completed in the REPRISE III clinical trial, which is required to support FDA premarket approval for the Lotus\u2122 Valve System. The WATCHMAN\u00ae Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology (WATCHMAN\u00ae) is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin, and is marketed in CE-mark countries and other international countries, as well as the U.S. following FDA approval in March 2015.\nPeripheral Interventions\nOur Peripheral Interventions (PI) product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease, along with certain products to diagnose and ease various forms of cancer.\nOur worldwide net sales of PI products were $904 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of PI products increased $54 million, or six percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $60 million negative impact on our worldwide PI net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $114 million, or 13 percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide PI net sales was primarily driven by revenues from acquired Bayer products, as well as growth in our core PI franchises, our stent franchise following FDA approval and launch of our Innova\u2122 Vascular self-expanding stent system in the U.S., our interventional oncology franchise and our drug-eluting product franchise.\nOn December 31, 2015, we acquired the interventional radiology portfolio of CeloNova Biosciences (CeloNova). The acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. We believe the CeloNova team and technologies will help advance our position and growth profile within the interventional oncology market.\nOn August 29, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer for $414 million in cash. We believe that this acquisition enhances our ability to offer physicians and healthcare systems a more complete portfolio of solutions to treat challenging vascular conditions. The addition of Bayer's strong commercial organization and innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease. The transaction includes the leading AngioJet\u00ae Thrombectomy System and the Fetch\u00ae 2 Aspiration Catheter, which are used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins, and the JetStream\u00ae Atherectomy System, used in an innovative and fast-growing therapy to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries.\nRhythm Management\nCardiac Rhythm Management\nOur Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, including the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the S-ICD\u00ae System, and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities.\nOur worldwide net sales of CRM products were $1.807 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 24 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of CRM products decreased $105 million, or five percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $117 million negative impact on our CRM net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $12 million, or one percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide CRM net sales was primarily driven by growth in our S-ICD\u00ae\nnet sales following the launch of our next-generation Emblem S-ICD\u00ae system in Europe and the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2015, as well as growth in our international CRM business as we increase market share following recent product launches, partially offset by lower volumes of replacement procedures for our defibrillators due to their longevity and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) sales declines in certain regions due to competitive technology offerings. In addition, our global pacemaker revenue increased on a constant currency basis during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by the continued adoption of the ACCOLADE\u2122 family of pacemakers and cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers, and the Ingevity\u2122 MRI pacing lead.\nThe following are the U.S. and international components of our worldwide CRM net sales:\n\nElectrophysiology\nOur Electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer\u2122 line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness, and the Rhythmia\u2122 Mapping System, a next-generation, catheter-based, 3-D cardiac mapping and navigation solution designed to help diagnose and treat a variety of arrhythmias.\nOur worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products were $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately three percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products increased $6 million, or two percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $14 million negative impact on our Electrophysiology net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $20 million, or nine percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Electrophysiology net sales was primarily due to increased sales of our Rhythmia\u2122 Mapping System and EP capital products.\nMedSurg\nEndoscopy\nOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products were $1.306 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products decreased $17 million, or one percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $96 million impact on our Endoscopy net sales in 2015 as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $79 million, or six percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Endoscopy net sales was primarily driven by growth across several of our key product franchises, including our biliary device franchise with the launch of the SpyGlass\u2122 DS Direct Visualization System and our AXIOS\u2122 Stent and Electrocautery-Enhanced Delivery System for endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural drainage of pancreatic pseudo cysts; our metal stent franchise driven by our Biliary WallFlex\u00ae product family; and our biopsy and polypectomy franchises, featuring our industry leading products such as forceps and snares.\nIn April 2015, we acquired Xlumena, Inc. (Xlumena), which developed minimally invasive devices for Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) guided transluminal drainage of targeted areas within the gastrointestinal tract, including the AXIOS\u2122 Stent.\nUrology and Pelvic Health\nOur Urology and Pelvic Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and pelvic conditions. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products were $693 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately nine percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products increased $158 million, or 30 percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $35 million impact on our Urology and Pelvic Health net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $193 million, or 36 percent. The year -over-year increase\nin worldwide Urology and Pelvic Health net sales was primarily attributable to revenue of approximately $158 million related to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition along with growth across all of our other global franchises.\nIn August 2015, we completed the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition includes the procurement of leading products for the treatment of a variety of urologic conditions, including the minimally invasive GreenLight XPS\u2122 and HPS\u2122 Laser Therapy Systems for treating BPH, the AMS 700\u2122 Inflatable Penile Prosthesis for treating erectile dysfunction, and the AMS 800\u2122 Urinary Control System for treating male stress urinary incontinence.\nIn May 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fully diluted equity of IoGyn, Inc. (IoGyn). IoGyn has developed the Symphion\u2122 System, a next generation system for hysteroscopic intrauterine tissue removal including fibroids (myomas) and polyps. In March 2014, IoGyn received U.S. FDA approval for the system and in October 2014, we launched the system in the U.S.\nNeuromodulation\nOur Neuromodulation business offers the Precision\u00ae and Precision Spectra\u2122 Spinal Cord Stimulator systems and, in Europe, the Precision Novi\u2122 SCS System, used for the management of chronic pain; and our Vercise\u2122 Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System in Europe for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $501 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately seven percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased $29 million, or six percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $9 million impact on our Neuromodulation net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $38 million, or eight percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Neuromodulation net sales was primarily driven by share gains from our CoverEdge\u2122 32-contact Paddle Lead and continued adoption of the Precision Spectra\u2122 Spinal Cord Stimulator System in the U.S. and increased net sales in Europe driven by our Vercise\u2122 DBS System and sales of the recently launched non-rechargeable Precision Novi\u2122 SCS System.\nEmerging Markets\nAs part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. We define Emerging Markets as including 20 developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors, and our global capabilities. We are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our Emerging Markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Our Emerging Markets revenue grew two percent, as compared to the prior year, and was approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact of 11 percent, net sales in these markets grew 13 percent.\nLitigation Charges\nWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.105 billion in 2015, $1.036 billion in 2014, and $221 million in 2013. See Results of Operations below and Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nNeurovascular Divestiture\nIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.500 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, $10 million during 2012, $30 million during 2013 and the final amount due to us in 2014. After the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker, we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement, and also manufactured and supplied products to Stryker through a supply agreement. These transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013. Our sales related to our divested Neurovascular business have ceased as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. See Results of Operations below and Note C - Divestitures to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nRestructuring Initiatives\nOn an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital, our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. We had one active restructuring program during 2015, our 2014 Restructuring Plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors on October 22, 2013. We substantially completed the activities under the plan during 2015, with the exception of certain actions associated with our plant network optimization strategy, which we expect to be complete by the end of 2016. Additional information can be found in Results of Operations below and Note H - Restructuring-related Activities to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nHealthcare Policies\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. We recorded $78 million in 2015, $72 million in 2014 and $73 million in 2013, within our selling, general and administrative expenses. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. The status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2017 is not clear. We intend to reinvest the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities, and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.\nWe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital's or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.\nAny changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally.\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nWe manage our global businesses on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard internal currency exchange rates held constant for each year.\nThe following table provides our worldwide net sales by global business and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or\nas a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management's use of this non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nThe constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O - Segment Reporting to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Growth rates are based on actual, non-rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely. Refer to Executive Summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2015 and 2014 net sales.\nIn 2014, we generated net sales of $7.380 billion, as compared to $7.143 billion in 2013, an increase of $237 million, or three percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $99 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 as compared to 2013 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $54 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $390 million, or six percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $97 million; from our Electrophysiology business of $74 million, primarily due to our acquisition of the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard Inc. in November 2013; from our Endoscopy business of $66 million, and from our Peripheral Interventions business of $56 million.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $5.304 billion in 2015, $5.170 billion in 2014, and $4.969 billion in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 70.9 percent in 2015, as compared to 70.1 percent in 2014 and 69.6 percent in 2013. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period:\n\nThe increase in our gross profit margin for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products. In addition, in connection with the accounting for the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, we adjusted acquired inventory from manufacturing cost to fair value. The step-up in value is amortized through gross profit over an average estimated inventory turnover period. In 2015, we recorded increased cost of $36 million associated with the step-up.\nThe increase in our gross profit margin for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs, as well as the positive impacts of lower sales related to our divested businesses, as these sales were at significantly lower gross profit margins. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products and changes in the mix of our product sales.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses:\n\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses\nIn 2015, our SG&A expenses decreased $29 million, or one percent, as compared to 2014, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. This decrease was driven by the impacts of our foreign currency fluctuations and declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.\nIn 2014, our SG&A expenses increased $228 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2013, and were 190 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A increases related to business combinations that we have completed over the last several years, product launches and other commercial and corporate programs, variable employee-related benefits and our expansion efforts in emerging markets, partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nWe remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. In 2015, our R&D expenses increased $59 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2014, and were 60 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The increase was due primarily to investments across all of our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth and increased cost related to recent acquisitions and alliances, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2014, our R&D expenses decreased $44 million, or approximately five percent, as compared to 2013, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease was due primarily to the benefits from our initiatives to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient, as well as the timing of certain R&D programs.\nRoyalty Expense\nIn 2015, our royalty expense decreased $41 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2014, and was 60 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.\nIn 2014, our royalty expense decreased $29 million, or 21 percent, as compared to 2013, and was 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.\nAmortization Expense\nOur amortization expense was $495 million in 2015, as compared to $438 million in 2014, an increase of $57 million or 13 percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired in the AMS Portfolio Acquisition.\nAmortization expense was $438 million in 2014, as compared to $410 million in 2013, an increase of $28 million or seven percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2013 and during 2014.\nAmortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.\nGoodwill & Intangible Asset Impairment Charges\nWe have recorded intangible asset impairment charges, including impairments of in-process research and development, of $19 million in 2015, $195 million in 2014 and $53 million in 2013.\nIn 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $423 million following our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units on January 1, 2013. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2015 and 2014.\nSee Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details related to our goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill impairment charges and intangible asset impairment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.\nContingent Consideration Expense\nWe recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $123 million in 2015, a net benefit of $85 million in 2014 and a net expense of $4 million in 2013. See Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our contingent consideration expense associated with our acquisitions. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nRestructuring-related Activities and Charges\nWe recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plan of $26 million during 2015, $69 million during 2014, and $101 million during 2013. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $57 million during 2015, $48 million during 2014, and $23 million\nduring 2013. Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\n2014 Restructuring Plan\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have recorded total costs of $229 million under the 2014 Restructuring Plan, of which $125 million has been recorded as restructuring charges and the remaining portion has been recorded through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate that the 2014 Restructuring Plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $255 million to $270 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $200 million by the end of 2016. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.\nOther Restructuring Plans\nOur other restructuring plans, including our 2011 Restructuring Plan and our prior year Plant Network Optimization Program were substantially completed by the end of 2013.\nWe made cash payments of $95 million in 2015, $112 million in 2014, and $141 million in 2013 associated with our restructuring initiatives.\nSee Note H - Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our restructuring plans and activities.\nLitigation-related Charges and Credits\nWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.105 billion in 2015, $1.036 billion in 2014, and $221 million in 2013. The net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims, the Mirowski lawsuit and certain other items. The net charges recorded in 2014 include a $600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary, Guidant Corporation (Guidant) and Johnson & Johnson signed on February 13, 2015, to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson during 2015. The 2014 net charges also include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and certain other items. These charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our litigation-related matters.\nPension Termination Charges\nWe recorded pension termination charges of $44 million during 2015, which are associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. No pension termination charges were recorded during 2014 and 2013. We do not expect to incur any additional charges in the future related to the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan. The pension termination charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nGain on Divestiture\nIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million during 2014 and a gain of $38 million during 2013 associated with the transaction. These divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense increased to $284 million in 2015, as compared to $216 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to incremental debt to finance the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, offset by savings from the re-financing of our senior notes, along with a pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.000 billion of debt during the second quarter of 2015. Debt extinguishment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Our average borrowing rate was 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of debt extinguishment charges, and 4.8 percent in 2014. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F - Borrowings and Credit\nArrangements to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.\nOur interest expense decreased to $216 million in 2014, as compared to $324 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $70 million of debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of accelerated amortization of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. Our average borrowing rate was 4.8 percent in 2014, as compared to 6.9 percent in 2013, which includes the impact of the debt extinguishment charges.\nOther, net\nOur other, net reflected expense of $39 million in 2015, income of $8 million in 2014, and expense of $19 million in 2013. The following are the components of other, net:\n\nDuring 2015, we recognized net losses on investments of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. During 2014, we recognized gains of $19 million associated with the acquisition of IoGyn, Inc. related to previously held investments and other net gains related to our investment portfolio of $8 million. During 2013, we recognized losses on investments of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. The acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.\nTax Rate\nThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:\n\n*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.\nThe change in our reported tax rate for 2015, as compared to 2014 and 2013, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.\nIn 2015, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, litigation- and restructuring-related items, pension termination charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2015 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to settlement of various uncertain tax positions and reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied.\nIn 2014, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, and litigation- and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate for 2014 was also affected by discrete tax items primarily related to resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable court ruling, offset by a charge due to translation gain on previously taxed income.\nIn 2013, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges, litigation- and restructuring-related charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration\nof the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied. Excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the change in our reported tax rate between years is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business and in 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe have received Notices of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. The total incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. In addition to the Notices of Deficiency, during 2014, we received a Revenue Agent Report from the IRS reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the IRS applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax years.\nWe do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, and we have filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the 2001 - 2007 tax years in challenge. We currently expect the trial in this matter to begin in the second half of 2016. Furthermore, we have submitted a letter to the IRS protesting the Revenue Agent Report for the 2008 - 2010 tax years and requesting an administrative appeal hearing. We do not believe that the IRS will hear our appeal until the Tax Court case is concluded.\nNo payments on the net assessments would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of December 31, 2015. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSee Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our tax rate and our tax court disputes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $319 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $118 million invested in money market and government funds and $201 million in short-term time deposits and interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $300 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.\nThe following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2015, we generated $600 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.269 billion in 2014, a decrease of $669 million or 53 percent. This decrease was primarily due to $600 million of payments to Johnson & Johnson as a result of the settlement agreement signed on February 13, 2015 to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson against Guidant, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant in 2006. As a result of the settlement agreement, Johnson & Johnson agreed to dismiss permanently its action without acknowledgment of liability by Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson.\nDuring 2014, we generated $1.269 billion of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.110 billion in 2013, an increase of $159 million, or 14 percent. This increase was primarily due to reductions in our accounts receivable due to a government funded settlement of outstanding receivables in Spain during 2014 and lower payments related to interest and costs associated with debt extinguishment; partially offset by increases in our inventory levels and higher payments related to contingent consideration.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2015, cash used for investing activities was $2.186 billion. Our investing activities included $1.734 billion of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions, including the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, CeloNova and Xlumena; along with $266 million of payments related to strategic investments, including equity investments in Preventice, Inc. and Frankenman Medical Equipment Company. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $247 million. We intend to invest approximately $350 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2016.\nDuring 2014, cash used for investing activities was $745 million. Our investing activities included $486 million of payments for the acquisitions of IoGyn and the Interventional Division of Bayer, net of cash acquired. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of capital expenditures of $259 million.\nDuring 2013, cash used for investing activities was $475 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $245 million and a $274 million payment for the acquisition of C.R. Bard's electrophysiology business. These expenditures were partially offset by $53 million of proceeds received from the sale of our Natick, Massachusetts headquarters in 2013.\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $156 million of contingent payments in 2015, $34 million of payments in 2014 and $160 million of payments in 2013 associated with our previous acquisitions.\nOur liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk and uncertainties could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans.\nDebt\nWe had total debt of $5.677 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $4.244 billion as of December 31, 2014 which consisted of the following:\nCredit Facilities\nIn April 2015, we entered into a new $2.000 billion revolving credit facility (the 2015 Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous $2.000 billion revolving credit facility. The 2015 Facility matures in April 2020. There were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014.\nWe also maintain a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables maturing on June 9, 2017. We had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTerm Loans\nIn April 2015, we entered into a $750 million, unsecured term loan facility (2015 Term Loan). We had $750 million outstanding under the 2015 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a $400 million, unsecured term loan facility (2013 Term Loan). We had $250 million outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015 and $400 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014.\nOur revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities require that we maintain certain financial covenants as outlined in Note F - Borrowings and Credit Agreements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of and through December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers.\nSenior Notes\nWe had $4.650 billion of senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and $3.800 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Our senior notes are publicly registered securities, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if directly borrowed by our subsidiaries and liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:\n\n Note: The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes or debt issuance costs. \nOther Arrangements\nWe have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $392 million as of December 31, 2015. We de-recognized $151 million of receivables as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 2.4 percent, and $167 million as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 3.2 percent. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 21.000 billion Japanese yen (approximately $175 million as of December 31, 2015). We de-recognized $132 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent and $134 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit of $44 million, as compared to $59 million as of December 31, 2014, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees.\nFor additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facilities, term loans, senior notes and other arrangements, see Note F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nEquity\nDuring 2015 we received $114 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $60 million in 2014 and $74 million 2013. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.\nWe repurchased 10 million shares for $125 million during 2014, and 51 million shares for $500 million during 2013. No share repurchases were made in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nStock-based compensation expense related to our stock equity compensation and ownership plans was $107 million in 2015, $103 million in 2014, and $105 million in 2013. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2015.\n\n (1) In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.  The amounts in the table above with respect to lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.056 billion the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.\nWith certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects we acquired is between $100 million and $150 million. Net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2016 through 2024, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2015.\nLegal Matters\nFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings see Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management's judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities and Intangible Assets, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.\nSee Note A-Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. In addition, see Note B - Acquisitions and Strategic Investments and Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration; Note J -Income Taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and Note K - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.\nMany of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE\u00ae Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Generally, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nInventory Provisions\nWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.\nWe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable,we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with\nthe carrying value in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.\nGoodwill Valuation\nWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. For our 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units, including Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.\nIn applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units' future expected cash flows.\nIf the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists, we then perform the second step of the goodwill test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value.\nAlthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. As a result of the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test, we identified our global Electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. Also, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent; however, due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years, no goodwill remains within our CRM reporting unit.\nOn a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth\nrates and levels of profitability. Terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC, are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, keeping all other variables constant, a combined increase of 50 basis points in the WACC along with a simultaneous decrease of 150 basis points in the long term growth rate applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global Electrophysiology reporting unit. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in business performance may result in impairment of our goodwill.\nLegal and Product Liability Accruals\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Therefore, judgment is required based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note Q - New Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on Standards Implemented and Standards to be Implemented.\nAdditional Information\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Boston Scientific\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nThe GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.\nManagement uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments' measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.\nWe believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes\u201d of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nThe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share\n \u2022 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - These charges represent (a) non-cash write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during 2015, 2014, and 2013; and (b) a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our global Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013. We remove the impact of non-cash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. \n \u2022 Acquisition- and divestiture related net charges (credits) - These adjustments consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held investments; (c) purchased and/or funded in-process research and development expenses incurred outside of a business combination; (d) due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs; and (e) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. Due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations. Separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \n \u2022 Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments represent primarily severance and other direct costs associated with our restructuring programs. These costs are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \n \u2022 Litigation-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \n \u2022 Debt extinguishment charges - These charges represent premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.0 billion of public senior notes during the second quarter of 2015 and the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. These adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \n \u2022 Pension termination charges - This item represents charges associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. These charges are not expected to recur after 2015 and do not reflect expected \nongoing operating results. Accordingly, management has excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.\n \u2022 Amortization expense - Amortization expense is a non-cash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the financial covenants included in our credit facility or our term loan facility agreements. Management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. \n \u2022 Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods in conjunction with the purchase accounting for an acquisition or as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges or credits. These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \nRevenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Sales from Divested Businesses and/or Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n \u2022 Sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. \nAdjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as the sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans by Executive Officers\nPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. These plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about our company. We disclose details regarding individual Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below.\nThe AMS Portfolio Acquisition\nOn August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. As permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, management has excluded the AMS Portfolio Acquisition from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 as the acquisition was completed in August 2015. We are permitted to omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from our assessment of internal control for up to one year from the acquisition date. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition represents 1% of our total assets and 2% of our total revenues as of December 31, 2015.\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation\nWe have audited Boston Scientific Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control---Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the subsidiaries and assets of American Medical Systems that were acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation, which are included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Boston Scientific Corporation and constituted approximately 1% of total assets (excluding the goodwill and intangibles which were included in management's assessment of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015) and approximately 2% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Boston Scientific Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the subsidiaries and assets of American Medical Systems that were acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation.\nIn our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion

Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and divested businesses, net sales increased 8%. Sales growth was driven by acquisitions, new product launches, and growth in emerging markets.\n\n- Net loss in 2015 was $239 million, compared to $119 million net loss in 2014. On an adjusted basis, excluding certain items like intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition costs, litigation charges, etc., net income was $1.267 billion in 2015 vs $1.129 billion in 2014. \n\n- Operating cash flow was $600 million in 2015, down from $1.269 billion in 2014, primarily due to litigation settlement payments made in 2015.\n\n- Key developments: Completed two major acquisitions - the AMS Portfolio Acquisition to enhance the Urology and Pelvic Health business, and the Interventional Division of Bayer to expand the Peripheral Interventions business. Launched several new products like the SYNERGYTM coronary stent.\n\n- Ongoing litigation over tax issues remains unresolved - Boston Scientific contests IRS claims of additional taxes of $1.162 billion plus interest related to transfer pricing from 2001-2010 tax years. Trial expected in second half of 2016.\n\n- The report describes critical accounting estimates related to revenue recognition, inventory provisions, intangible assets, legal accruals, etc. and new accounting pronouncements that will impact financial reporting.\n\n- It also discusses use of non-GAAP measures like adjusted net income and constant currency growth rates to evaluate performance."}
