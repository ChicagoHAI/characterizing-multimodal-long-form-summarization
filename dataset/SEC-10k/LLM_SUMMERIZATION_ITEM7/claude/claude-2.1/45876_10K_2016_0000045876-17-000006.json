Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Harsco Corporation (the \"Company\") provided under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmounts included in this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are rounded in millions and all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts. As a result, minor differences may exist due to rounding.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe nature of the Company's business and the many countries in which it operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In accordance with the \"safe harbor\" provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company provides the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward-looking statements, including the expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Forward-looking statements contained herein could include, among other things, statements about management's confidence in and strategies for performance; expectations for new and existing products, technologies and opportunities; and expectations regarding growth, sales, cash flows, and earnings. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of such terms as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"likely,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan\" or other comparable terms.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in the worldwide business environment in which the Company operates, including general economic conditions; (2) changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity and fuel costs and capital costs;(3) changes in the performance of equity and bond markets that could affect, among other things, the valuation of the assets in the Company's pension plans and the accounting for pension assets, liabilities and expenses; (4) changes in governmental laws and regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety, tax and import tariff standards; (5) market and competitive changes, including pricing pressures, market demand and acceptance for new products, services and technologies; (6) the Company's inability or failure to protect its intellectual property rights from infringement in one or more of the many countries in which the Company operates; (7) failure to effectively prevent, detect or recover from breaches in the Company's cybersecurity infrastructure; (8) unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of the many countries in which the Company operates due to political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities, public health issues or other calamities; (9) disruptions associated with labor disputes and increased operating costs associated with union organization; (10) the seasonal nature of the Company's business; (11) the Company's ability to successfully enter into new contracts and complete new acquisitions or strategic ventures in the time-frame contemplated, or at all; (12) the integration of the Company's strategic acquisitions; (13) the amount and timing of repurchases of the Company's common stock, if any; (14) the prolonged recovery in global financial and credit markets and economic conditions generally, which could result in the Company's customers curtailing development projects, construction, production and capital expenditures, which, in turn, could reduce the demand for the Company's products and services and, accordingly, the Company's revenues, margins and profitability; (15) the outcome of any disputes with customers, contractors and subcontractors; (16) the financial condition of the Company's customers, including the ability of customers (especially those that may be highly leveraged and those with inadequate liquidity) to maintain their credit availability; (17) the Company's ability to successfully implement and receive the expected benefits of cost-reduction and restructuring initiatives, including the achievement of expected cost savings in the expected time frame; (18) implementation of environmental remediation matters; (19) risk and uncertainty associated with intangible assets; (20) the impact of a transaction, if any, resulting from the Company's determination to explore strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; and (21) other risk factors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. A further discussion of these, along with other potential risk factors, can be found in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company cautions that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. The Company undertakes no duty to update forward-looking statements except as may be required by law.\nExecutive Overview\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a new senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d), consisting of a $400 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $550 million term loan B facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\"). Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the 5.75% Senior Notes due 2018 (the Notes\u201d) in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Financing Agreements and the Notes. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nIn September 2016, the Company sold its remaining approximate 26% equity interest in Brand Energy & Infrastructure Services (\"Brand\"). In exchange for the Company's interest, (i) the Company received $145 million in cash, net, and (ii) the requirement for the Company to fund certain obligations to Brand through 2018 were satisfied, the present value of which equaled $20.6 million. As a result of the sale, the Company's obligation to make quarterly payments related to the unit adjustment liability under the terms of a limited partnership agreement that governed the operation of the strategic venture terminated. The Company recognized a loss on the sale of its equity interest in Brand in the amount of $43.5 million, which was recognized in Change in fair value to unit adjustment liability and loss on dilution and sale of equity method investment on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nAlthough steel markets have demonstrated some improvement, the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment continued to be negatively impacted by lower customer steel production, weak commodity prices and site exits during 2016. These impacts have been offset by the savings and benefits achieved as part of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment's Improvement Plan (\"Project Orion\") including lower compensation costs and the impact of exited underperforming contracts. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Project Orion was expanded with additional targeted workforce and operational savings of $20 million to $25 million. The majority of these benefits were realized during 2016. See Note 19, Restructuring Programs, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. Also, results for 2015 included costs incurred by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment related to a steel mill customer liquidation, salt cake disposal costs and charges associated with a subcontractor settlement which decreased operating income by $24.9 million. The Company remains focused on achieving additional cost reductions and operational improvements to enhance returns for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nThe Harsco Rail Segment recorded estimated forward loss provision of $45.1 million during 2016 related to the Company's contracts with the federal railway system of Switzerland (\"SBB\"). The estimated forward loss provision resulted from increased vendor costs, ongoing discussions with SBB, and increased estimates for commissioning, certification and testing costs, as well as expected settlements with SBB. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. Also, results for 2015 included a $10.9 million foreign exchange gain that was not repeated in 2016. Additionally, the Harsco Rail Segment continues to be impacted by continued weakness in the North American market.\nWhile energy markets have demonstrated some fundamental improvement, the Harsco Industrial Segment's air-cooled heat exchangers and industrial grating businesses will lag the market given the lead time for capital expenditures to formalize into new projects for customers in the upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas markets served by the Company to be constrained. Accordingly, these factors are expected to impact revenue and operating income during the first half of 2017 in the Harsco Industrial Segment.\nThe Company has announced its intention to pursue strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment from the rest of the Company. A separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment would allow each of the Company's businesses to benefit from dedicated capital structures; execute tailored and flexible strategic priorities; and optimize capital return policies consistent with each business's unique priorities. There is no specific timetable related to this initiative and there can be no assurance that a sale, spin-off or any other transaction will take place. The Company incurred $3.3 million and $9.9 million of expenses during 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the separation, which are included as part of Corporate in the Company's segment results.\nRevenues by Segment\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Metals & Minerals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>965.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,106.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(140.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Rail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,451.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,723.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(271.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues by Region\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Western Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(70.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>654.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>807.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(153.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eastern Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,451.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,723.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(271.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes Mexico.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Revenues for the Company totaled $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company believes these actions will enable it to generate returns above its cost of capital with a balanced business portfolio without endangering its financial profile with unreasonable leverage.\nThese business portfolio strategies will continue to focus on improving the performance of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment while pursuing select growth opportunities as global steel markets recover. For the Harsco Rail and Harsco Industrial Segments, the Company will focus on disciplined growth organically, and through acquisitions, that improve these businesses' competitive positions in core or adjacent markets. The Company will continue to pursue cost-reduction and efficiency initiatives, including Continuous Improvement, which have significantly reduced, and are expected to continue to reduce, the Company's cost structure and further enhance its financial strength without diminishing its services and products capabilities. As part of these initiatives, the Company will continue to focus on maintaining an active, lean corporate center that optimizes corporate costs while continuing to develop value added activities to support the Company.\nThe Company's expansion into targeted growth markets; its diversity of services and products in industries that are fundamental to global growth; its long-term mill services and minerals supply contracts; its differentiated technologies and innovations; its return based capital allocations and business portfolio strategies; and its focus on executing cost reduction and efficiency initiatives, help mitigate the Company's overall long-term exposure to changes in the economic outlook in any single economy or industry. However, deterioration of global economies and industries could still have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe following significant items, risks, trends and strategies are expected to affect the Company in 2017 and beyond:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Company will focus on providing returns above its cost of capital for its stockholders by balancing its portfolio of businesses, and by executing its strategic and operational practices with reasonable amounts of financial leverage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Company will continue to build and develop strong core capabilities and maintain an active and lean corporate center that balances costs with value added services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Company will assess capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives.

The increase primarily relates to $1.1 million of deferred financing costs expensed by the Company during the third quarter of 2016 related to payments for the Term Loan Facility and increased interest rates associated with the Company's borrowings, as well as other financing costs partially offset by lower debt levels. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\n2015 vs. 2014\nInterest expense in 2015 was $46.8 million, a decrease of $0.3 million or 1% compared with 2014. There were no individually significant items related to the change in this Statement of Operations caption.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a New Credit Facility, consisting of a $400 million revolving credit facility and a $550 million term loan B facility. Upon closing of the New Credit Facility, the Company has amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing Term Loan Facility and has redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nChange in Fair Value to the Unit Adjustment Liability and Loss on Dilution and Sale of Equity Method Investment\nThe Change in fair value to the unit adjustment liability and loss on dilution and sale of equity method investment during 2016 increased $50.0 million compared with 2015. The increase relates to the loss associated with Company's first quarter of 2016 election not to make the quarterly cash payments to the Company's partner in the Infrastructure strategic venture for the remainder of 2016 and the Company's third quarter of 2016 sale of its remaining equity interest in the Infrastructure strategic venture. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments and Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nIncome Tax Expense from Continuing Operations\n2016 vs. 2015\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations in 2016 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $21.0 million compared with 2015. The effective income tax rate relating to continued operations for 2016 was (8.4)% versus 79.5% for 2015. The decrease in income tax expense and the change in the effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was primarily due to the change in the mix in earnings between international jurisdictions and the non-recurring loss on early extinguishment of debt. Additionally, there was no income tax benefit realized from the loss on the sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand, as a valuation allowance of $16.1 million was established to offset the deferred tax assets on the resulting capital loss carryforward. There was also no income tax benefit realized from the estimated forward loss provisions related to the SBB contracts, as a valuation allowance of $13.5 million was established to offset the deferred tax assets on the resulting loss carryforward, because the Company determined that it is not more likely than not that these benefits will be realized in the future.\n2015 vs. 2014\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations in 2015 was $27.7 million, a decrease of $2.7 million compared with 2014 and the effective income tax rate relating to continued operations for 2015 was 79.5% versus 214.8% for 2014. The decrease in income tax expense and the change in the effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was primarily due to a reduction in restructuring and asset impairment charges in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment for which no tax benefit was recorded.\nSee Note 11, Income Taxes, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nTotal Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n2016 vs. 2015\nTotal other comprehensive loss was $93.6 million in 2016, compared with total other comprehensive income of $13.9 million in 2015. The major drivers for this change were pension liability adjustments and foreign currency translation adjustments. The pension liability adjustments were the result of lower global weighted average discount rates, principally for the U.K. plan, which decreased from 3.9% to 3.1% during the year. This was partially offset by actual returns on plan assets that were higher than expected returns. Foreign currency translation adjustments were negatively impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n2015 vs. 2014\nTotal other comprehensive income was $13.9 million in 2015, compared with total other comprehensive loss of $163.2 million in 2014. The major drivers for this change were pension liability adjustments, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments. The pension liability adjustments were the result of higher global weighted average discount rates that increased from 3.7% to 3.9% during the year, partially offset by actual returns on plan assets that were less than the expected returns. Foreign currency translation adjustments were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of a $400 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $550 million Term Loan Facility. Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Financing Agreements and the Notes, and is reflected in the financing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a reduction of long-term debt.\nThe Company has sufficient financial liquidity and borrowing capacity to support the strategies within each of our businesses. The Company currently expects operational and business needs to be met by cash provided by operations supplemented with borrowings from time to time due to historical patterns of seasonal cash flow and for the funding of various projects. The Company continues to assess its capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives.\nThe Company continues to implement and perform capital efficiency initiatives to enhance liquidity and working capital efficiency. These initiatives have included: prudent allocation of capital spending to those projects where the highest results can be achieved; optimization of worldwide cash positions; reductions in discretionary spending; frequent evaluation of customer and business-partner credit risk; and Continuous Improvement initiatives aimed at improving the effective and efficient use of working capital, particularly in accounts receivable and inventories.\nDuring 2016, the Company generated $159.8 million in operating cash flow, an increase from the $121.5 million generated in 2015.\nIn 2016, the Company invested $69.3 million in capital expenditures, mostly for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, compared with $123.6 million in 2015. The Company generated $9.3 million in cash flow from asset sales in 2016 compared with $26.0 million in 2015. Asset sales have been a normal part of the Company's business model, primarily for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nIn September 2016, the Company received approximately $145 million in cash, net, from the sale of its remaining 26% equity interest in Brand. In 2016, the Company received proceeds from the termination of cross-currency interest rate swaps (\"CCIRs\") of $16.6 million compared with $75.1 million in 2015. The Company paid $4.1 million and $65.7 million in dividends to stockholders in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has suspended the quarterly dividend to preserve financial flexibility. The Board of Directors (the \"Board\") will continue to evaluate the Company's dividend policy each quarter.\nThe Company's net cash borrowings decreased by $261.2 million in 2016 principally due to the utilization of operating cash flows, proceeds from the termination of CCIRs and proceeds from the sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand. The Company's consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") ratio, as defined by the Credit Agreement, was 2.3 to 1.0 at December 31, 2016.\nCash Requirements\nThe following summarizes the Company's expected future payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2016:\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments at December 31, 2016 (a)\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nyears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (including current maturities and capital leases)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>673.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected interest payments on long-term debt (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension obligations (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (non-cancellable)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cross-currency interest rate swaps (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange forward contracts (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations (g)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,118.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>596.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements; Note 9, Operating Leases; Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans; Note 11, Income Taxes; and Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information on short-term borrowings and long-term debt (including capital leases); operating leases; employee benefit plans; income taxes; CCIRs and foreign currency exchange forward contracts, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>The total projected interest payments on long-term debt are based upon borrowings, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2016.

See Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under its Senior Secured Credit Facility, augmented by cash proceeds from asset sales. The primary drivers of the Company's cash flow from operations are the Company's revenues and income. Cash returns on capital investments made in the prior years, for which limited cash is currently required, are a significant source of cash provided by operations. Depreciation expense related to these investments is a non-cash charge.\nThe Company plans to redeploy discretionary cash for potential growth opportunities, such as disciplined organic growth and higher-return service contracts opportunities for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, and strategic investments or possible acquisitions in the Harsco Rail and Harsco Industrial Segments that improve competitive positioning in core markets or adjacent markets.\nResources Available for Cash Requirements for Operational and Growth Initiatives\nIn addition to utilizing cash provided by operations and cash proceeds from asset sales, the Company has bank credit facilities available throughout the world. The Company also utilizes capital leases to finance the acquisition of certain equipment when appropriate, which allows the Company to minimize capital expenditures. The Company expects to continue to utilize all these sources to meet future cash requirements for operations and growth initiatives.\nOn December 2, 2015, the Company entered into (i) an amendment and restatement agreement and (ii) a second amended and restated credit agreement (together, the Financing Agreements\u201d). The Financing Agreements increased the Company's overall borrowing capacity from $500 million to $600 million by (i) amending and restating the Company's then existing credit agreement, (ii) establishing a term loan A facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $250 million, by converting a portion of the outstanding balance under the then existing credit agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis and (iii) reducing the Revolving Credit Facility limit to $350 million.\nDuring September 2016, the Company received approximately $145 million in cash, net, from its sale of its remaining 26% equity interest in the Infrastructure strategic venture. The Company used these proceeds to repay $85.0 million on the term loan A facility and $60.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. Related to the repayment of the term loan A facility, the Company expensed $1.1 million of previously deferred financing costs.\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 87.5 to 200 basis points over the base rate or 187.5 to 300 basis points over the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility (the \"Credit Agreement\"). Any principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility is due and payable on the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on November 2, 2021.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 375 to 400 basis points over the base rate or 475 to 500 basis points over the adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to a 1% floor, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments, beginning in March 2017, each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the loans under the Term Loan Facility. These payments are reduced by the application of any prepayments, and any remaining balance is due and payable on the maturity of the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility matures on November 2, 2023.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility imposes certain restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions as to types and amounts of debt and liens that may be incurred by the Company; limitations on increases in dividend payments and limitations on certain acquisitions by the Company.\nThe obligations of the Company are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries ( Guarantors\u201d). All obligations under the Senior Credit Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Guarantors.\nIn January 2017, the Company entered into a series of fixed-floating interest rate swaps that cover the period from 2018 through 2021, and had the effect of converting $300 million of the Term Loan Facility from floating-rate to fixed-rate. The fixed rates provided by the swaps replace the adjusted LIBOR rate in the interest calculation, range from 1.65% for 2018 to 2.71% for 2021.\nThe following table illustrates available credit at December 31, 2016: Table 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facility Limit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available\nCredit\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-year revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had $648.0 million of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility consisting of $550.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and $98.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, of this balance, $642.5 million was classified as long-term debt and $5.5 million was classified as current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $415.0 million of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisting of $250.0 million under the term loan A facility and $165.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2015, of this balance, $380.5 million was classified as long-term debt,\n$22.0 million was classified as short-term borrowings and $12.5 million was classified as current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Historically, the Company has utilized these discretionary cash flows for growth-related capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment and dividend payments.\nThe types of products and services that the Company provides are not subject to rapid technological change, which increases the stability of related cash flows. Additionally, the Company believes each business in its portfolio is a leader in the industries and major markets the Company serves. Due to these factors, the Company is confident in the Company's future ability to generate positive cash flows from operations.\nThe Company has historically generated the majority of its cash flows in the second half of the year. Additionally, the Company's cash flows have been negatively impacted in the near term by reduced steel production, weaker commodity prices and demand, the impact of site exits in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment and low oil prices impacting capital expenditures and overall spending by customers in the natural gas, natural gas processing and petrochemical industries.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided (used) by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(229.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(292.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $159.8 million, an increase of $38.3 million from 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to timing in inventory purchases, increases in accrued compensation and increases on advances on contracts; partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable invoicing and collections and the timing of accounts payables. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was $121.5 million, a decrease of $105.2 million from 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower customer advances, and an increase in inventory primarily related to the SBB contracts in the Harsco Rail Segment, partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable invoicing and collections.\nIncluded in the Cash flows from operating activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is the caption, Other, net. In 2015, this caption included the Harsco Rail Segment foreign exchange gain which is reflected in the Effect of exchange rate changes on cash. In 2014, this caption consisted of principally the impact of non-cash impaired asset write-downs related to the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nAlso included in the Cash flows from operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is the caption, Other assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the decreases in this caption were\n$12.8 million, $6.0 million and $17.1 million, respectively. A summary of the major components of this caption for the periods presented is as follows: Table 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Change in prepaid expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Change in non-current insurance accruals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(i)\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>Other relates primarily to other accruals that are individually not significant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided (used) by investing activities - Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was $122.9 million, an increase of $253.3 million from 2015. The increase is primarily due to the gross proceeds received from the sale of the Company's remaining 26% equity interest in Brand; a lower level of capital expenditures in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, no payments for the unit adjustment liability; and an increase related to foreign currency hedge settlements reported as Other investing activities. In 2015, net cash used by investing activities was $130.4 million, a decrease of\n$99.2 million from 2014. The net decrease was primarily due to a lower level of capital expenditures, primarily in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; a net decrease in purchases of businesses which consisted of Protran and JK Rail in the Harsco Rail Segment in 2015 and Hammco in the Harsco Industrial Segment in 2014; and an increase in proceeds from sales of assets, partially offset by the final working capital adjustment related to the Infrastructure Transaction which was received in 2014. Capital investments decreased $85.3 million compared with 2014.\nCash provided (used) by financing activities - Net cash used by financing activities in 2016 was $292.3 million, an increase of $314.7 million from 2015. The change was primarily due to net cash payments on debt of $261.2 million in 2016 compared with $47.3 million in 2015; reduction in proceeds from the termination of CCIRs and a deferred pension underfunding payment related to the Company's equity interest in Brand; partially offset by lower dividends paid and no repurchases of the Company's common stock in 2016. In 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.5 million, an increase of $44.2 million from 2014. The change was primarily due to proceeds of $75.1 million from the termination of a CCIR, partially offset by an increase in the treasury shares purchased under the Company's share repurchase program then in effect and a decrease in year-over-year net cash borrowings.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Credit Agreement contains a consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant, which is not to exceed 4.0 to 1.0, and a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges ratio covenant, which is not to be less than 3.0 to 1.0. The consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant is reduced to 3.75 to1.0 after December 31, 2016 and to 3.5 to 1.0 after December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with these covenants as the net leverage ratio was 2.3 to 1.0 and interest coverage ratio was 5.1 to 1.0. Based on balances and covenants in effect at December 31, 2016, the Company could increase net debt by $447.6 million (although the Company only has $258.5 million available credit remaining under the Revolving Credit Facility), and still be in compliance with these debt covenants. Alternatively, keeping all other factors constant, the Company's adjusted EBITDA could decrease by $109.1 million and the Company would still be within these debt covenants. The Company expects to continue to be in compliance with these debt covenants for at least the next twelve months.\nCash Management\nThe Company has various cash management systems throughout the world that centralize cash in various bank accounts where it is economically justifiable and legally permissible to do so. These centralized cash balances are then redeployed to other operations to reduce short-term borrowings and to finance working capital needs or capital expenditures. Due to the transitory nature of cash balances, they are normally invested in bank deposits that can be withdrawn at will or in very liquid short-term bank time deposits and government obligations. The Company's policy is to use the largest banks in the various countries in which the Company operates. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of banks and when appropriate will adjust banking operations to reduce or eliminate exposure to less credit-worthy banks. The Company plans to continue the strategy of targeted, prudent investing for strategic purposes for the foreseeable future and to make more efficient use of existing investments.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents included $70.5 million held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, less than 10% of the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents had regulatory restrictions that would preclude the transfer of funds with and among subsidiaries. The cash and cash equivalents held by non-U.S. subsidiaries also included $26.7 million held in consolidated strategic ventures. The strategic venture agreements may require strategic venture partner approval to transfer funds with and among subsidiaries. While the Company's remaining non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents can be transferred with and among subsidiaries, the majority of these non-U.S. cash balances will be used to support the ongoing working capital needs and continued growth of the Company's non-U.S. operations.\nThe Company's financial position and debt capacity should enable it to meet current and future requirements. The Company continues to assess its capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates, including those related to defined benefit pension benefits, notes and accounts receivable, goodwill, long-lived asset impairment, inventories, revenue recognition - long-term contracts, insurance reserves and income taxes. The impact of changes in these estimates, as necessary, is reflected in the respective segment's results of operations in the period of the change. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different outcomes, assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by the Company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the Audit Committee of the Board and they have reviewed the Company's disclosures relating to these estimates in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These items should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nDefined Benefit Pension Benefits\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans in several countries. The largest of these plans are in the U.K. and the U.S. The Company's funding policy for these plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding pursuant to U.K. and U.S. statutory requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate.\nChanges in the discount rate assumption and the actual performance of plan assets compared with the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are the primary drivers in the change in funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. These factors are components of actuarial loss (gain) and impact the amount recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss), as such actuarial changes are not reflected directly on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but amortized over time in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCritical Estimate-Defined Benefit Pension Benefits\nAccounting for defined benefit pension plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions. The principal assumptions used include the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Each assumption is reviewed annually and represents management's best estimate at that time. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time, and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of unfunded benefit obligation and the expense recognized.\nThe discount rates used in calculating the Company's projected benefit obligations at the December 31, 2016 measurement date for the U.K. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans were 2.7% and 4.0%, respectively, and the global weighted-average discount rate was 3.1%. The discount rates selected represent level-equivalent rates using the yield curve spot rates on a year-by-year expected cash flow basis, using yield curves of high-quality corporate bonds. Annual net periodic pension cost (\"NPPC\") is determined using the discount rates at the beginning of the year. The discount rates for 2016 expense were 3.8% for the U.K. plan, 4.2% for the U.S. plans and 3.9% for the global weighted-average of plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by evaluating the asset return expectations with the Company's advisors as well as actual, long-term, historical results of asset returns for the pension plans. Generally the NPPC increases as the expected long-term rate of return on assets decreases. For 2017 and 2016, the global weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption is 6.2% and 6.7%, respectively. This rate was determined based on a model of expected asset returns for an actively managed portfolio.\nChanges in NPPC may occur in the future due to changes in actuarial assumptions, and due to changes in returns on plan assets resulting from financial market conditions. Holding all other assumptions constant, using December 31, 2016 plan data, a one-quarter percent increase or decrease in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease annual 2016 pre-tax defined benefit NPPC as follows:\nApproximate Changes in Pre-tax Defined Benefit Net Periodic Pension Cost\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.K. Plan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-quarter percent increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase of $0.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease of $0.4 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-quarter percent decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease of $0.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase of $0.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-quarter percent increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease of $0.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease of $1.7 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-quarter percent decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase of $0.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase of $1.7 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncreases or decreases to the net pension obligations may be required should circumstances that affect these estimates change. Additionally, certain events could result in the pension obligation changing at a time other than the annual measurement date. This would occur when a benefit plan is amended or when plan curtailments or settlements occur.\nThe Company has changed the method utilized to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of NPPC for defined benefit pension plans for 2016 and later. The more precise application of discount rates for measuring both service costs and interest costs employs yield curve spot rates on a year-by-year expected cash flow basis, using the same yield curves that the Company has previously used. This change in method represented a change in accounting estimate and has been accounted for in the period of change. This change in method decreased the Company's NPPC by approximately $7 million for 2016, compared to what NPPC would have been under the prior method.\nSee Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nNotes and Accounts Receivable\nNotes and accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value through the use of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. The Company has policies and procedures in place requiring customers to be evaluated for creditworthiness prior to the execution of new service contracts or shipments of products. These reviews are structured to minimize the Company's risk related to realizability of receivables. Despite these policies and procedures, the Company may at times still experience collection problems and potential bad debts due to economic conditions within certain industries (e.g., steel industry), countries or regions in which the Company operates. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, trade accounts receivable of $236.6 million and $254.9 million, respectively, were net of reserves of $11.8 million and $25.6 million, respectively.\nCritical Estimate-Notes and Accounts Receivable\nA considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the realizability of receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer, related aging of past due balances and the facts and circumstances surrounding any non-payment. The Company did not make any significant provisions for bad debts during 2016. The Company's provisions for bad debts during 2015 and 2014 were $13.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively.\nOn a monthly basis, customer accounts are analyzed for collectability. Reserves are established based upon a specific-identification method as well as historical collection experience, as appropriate. The Company also evaluates specific accounts when it becomes aware of a situation in which a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration in financial condition, credit ratings, bankruptcy or receivership. The reserves are based on the facts available to the Company and are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available. Reserves are also determined by using percentages (based upon experience) applied to certain aged receivable categories. Specific issues are discussed with corporate management, and any significant changes in reserve amounts or the write-off of balances must be approved by specifically designated corporate personnel. All approved items are monitored to ensure they are recorded in the proper period. Additionally, any significant changes in reserve balances are reviewed to ensure the proper corporate approval has occurred.\nIf the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Conversely, an improvement in a customer's ability to make payments could result in a decrease of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to both of these situations would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the change was determined. As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a bad debt reserve of\n$2.6 million on receivables with a large steel mill customer who filed for protection under the Marzano Law. During the second quarter of 2014, the customer terminated its contract with the Company under the provisions of the Marzano Law. As a result, during the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded an additional bad debt reserve of $3.9 million on the remaining pre-receivership receivables with this customer. During 2014, the Company recorded a bad debt reserve of $2.6 million for one of its Canadian steel mill customers that filed for receivership protection during the course of the year as the Company has previously disclosed. The amount of the bad debt reserve for this customer represents the full pre-receivership balance. As previously disclosed during 2015, one of the Company's steel mill customers in Europe ceased operations and began a formal process of liquidation in late 2015. The Company had recorded bad debt reserves of approximately $13 million related to this customer during 2015.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating allowances for doubtful accounts for the years presented. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nGoodwill\nThe Company's goodwill balances were $382.3 million and $400.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1. The Company has five reporting units (only three of which have goodwill associated with them as of December 31, 2016). The Company's reporting units with goodwill are the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, the Harsco Rail Segment and the air-cooled heat exchanger business of the Harsco Industrial Segment. Almost all of the Company's goodwill is allocated to the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nCritical Estimate-Goodwill\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to dispose of a business. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include declining cash flows or operating losses at the reporting unit level, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, among others.\nThe evaluation of potential goodwill impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to the net book value, including goodwill. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model ( DCF model\u201d) to estimate the current fair value of reporting units, as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of current fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the preparation of DCF models, including future revenues and operating margin growth, the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d), tax rates, capital spending, pension funding, the impact of strategic business initiatives, and working capital projections. These assumptions and estimates may vary significantly among reporting units. DCF models are based on approved long-range plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections for later years. WACC rates are derived from internal and external factors including, but not limited to, the average market price of the Company's stock, shares outstanding, book value of the Company's debt, the long-term risk free interest rate, and both market and size-specific risk premiums. Due to the many variables noted above and the relative size of the Company's goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material impact on the results of the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing. If the net book value of a reporting unit were to exceed the current fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would currently be required to determine if an impairment existed and the amount of goodwill impairment to record, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the net book value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if it were to be acquired in a hypothetical business combination, and the current fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. The second step of the goodwill impairment test requires the utilization of valuation experts.\nThe performance of the Company's 2016 annual impairment tests did not result in any impairment of the Company's goodwill.\nFor the Company's 2016 annual goodwill impairment test, the average annual revenue growth rates over the duration of the DCF models ranged from 1.7% to 4.8%. The WACCs used in the 2016 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 9.25% to 10.75%.\nThe Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment reporting unit's fair value at October 1, 2016 was approximately 12% more than the net book value. Significant assumptions utilized in the DCF model include a WACC of 10.75%, an average annual revenue growth rate of 1.7% and average annual cash flow growth rate of 0.6%. Should there be degradation in the overall markets served by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, it may result in an impairment of the Harsco Metal & Minerals Segment goodwill.\nIt is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction, including the Company's announced intention to pursue strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment from the rest of the Company, could differ materially from those used to evaluate the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may be impaired. The amounts charged against pre-tax income from continuing operations related to impaired long-lived assets included in Other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were $0.4 million, $8.2 million and $39.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The decrease in long-lived asset impairments in 2016 was due primarily to a decreased number of site exits in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment upon substantial completion of actions associated with Project Orion. The decrease in long-lived asset impairments in 2015 was due primarily to higher long-lived asset impairments in 2014 in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment as part of Project Orion.\nCritical Estimate-Asset Impairment\nThe determination of a long-lived asset impairment involves significant judgments based upon short-term and long-term projections of future asset performance. If the undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset (or asset group) do not exceed the asset's book value, impairment loss estimates would be based upon the difference between the book value and fair value of the asset. The fair value is generally based upon the Company's estimate of the amount that the assets could be bought or sold for in a transaction between willing parties. If quoted market prices for the asset or similar assets are unavailable, the fair value estimate is generally calculated using a DCF model. Should circumstances change that affect these estimates, additional impairment charges may be required and would be recorded through income in the period the change was determined.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating long-lived asset impairments for the years presented. U.S. GAAP requires consideration of all valuation techniques for which market participant inputs can be obtained without undue cost and effort. The use of a DCF model continues to be an appropriate method for determining fair value; however, methodologies such as quoted market prices must also be evaluated. See Note 17, Other Expenses, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory balances are adjusted for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, inventories of $187.7 million and $217.0 million, respectively, are net of lower of cost or market reserves and obsolescence reserves of $10.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively.\nCertain contracts within the Harsco Rail Segment, which meet specific criteria established in U.S. GAAP, are accounted for as long-term contracts. Inventories related to these contracts are considered Contracts-in-process and represent a separate component of Inventories. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Contracts-in-process of $54.0 million and $55.8 million, respectively, were included in Inventories. Contracts-in-process at December 31, 2016 were net of estimated forward loss-provisions related to these contacts of $36.2 million. No estimated forward loss provision was made at December 31, 2015.\nCritical Estimate-Inventories\nIn assessing the realization of inventory balances, the Company is required to make judgments as to future demand and compare these with current or committed inventory levels. If actual market conditions are determined to be less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the determination is made. Additionally, the Company records reserves to adjust a substantial portion of its U.S. inventory balances to the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method of inventory valuation. In adjusting these reserves throughout the year, the Company estimates its year-end inventory costs and quantities. At December 31 of each year, the reserves are adjusted to reflect actual year-end inventory costs and quantities. During periods of inflation, LIFO expense usually increases and during periods of deflation it decreases. These year-end adjustments resulted in pre-tax income of $1.2 million in 2016, pre-tax expense of $0.1 million in 2015 and pre-tax expense of $1.4 million in 2014.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating inventory reserves for the years presented. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition - Long-term Contracts\nCertain contracts within the Harsco Rail Segment, which meet specific criteria established in U.S. GAAP, are accounted for as long-term contracts, under the percentage-of-completion (units-of-delivery) method of accounting.\nCritical Estimate-Revenue Recognition - Long-term Contracts\nAccounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs (including estimating any liquidating damages or penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical items. Due to the number of years it may take to complete these contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, estimating total sales and costs at completion is inherently complicated and subject to many variables. Accordingly, estimates are subject to change as experience is gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of the work under the contract may not have changed. When adjustments in estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract using the percentage-of-completion method exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nDuring 2016, as a result of increased vendor costs, ongoing discussions with SBB, and increased estimates for commissioning, certification and testing costs, as well as expected settlements with SBB, the Company concluded it will have a loss on the contracts with SBB. The Company recognized an estimated forward loss provision related to the SBB contracts of\n$45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 in Costs of products sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was no estimated forward loss provision at December 31, 2015 or 2014. The estimated forward loss provision represents the Company's best estimate based on currently available information. It is possible that the Company's overall estimate of costs to complete these contracts may change which would result in an adjustment to the estimated forward loss provision at such time, but the Company is unable to estimate any further possible loss or range of loss at December 31, 2016.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company retains a significant portion of the risk for U.S. workers' compensation, U.K. employers' liability, automobile, general and product liability losses. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded liabilities of $37.1 million and $41.8 million, respectively, related to both asserted and unasserted insurance claims. At December 31, 2016 and 2015,\n$3.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, was included in insurance liabilities related to claims covered by insurance carriers for which a corresponding receivable has been recorded.\nCritical Estimate-Insurance Reserves\nInsurance reserves have been recorded based upon actuarial calculations that reflect the undiscounted estimated liabilities for ultimate losses, including claims incurred but not reported. Inherent in these estimates are assumptions that are based on the Company's history of claims and losses, a detailed analysis of existing claims with respect to potential value, and current legal and legislative trends. If actual claims differ from those projected by management, changes (either increases or decreases) to insurance reserves may be required and would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the change was determined. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a retrospective insurance reserve adjustment that decreased pre-tax insurance expense from continuing operations for self-insured programs by $5.4 million,\n$8.5 million and $7.0 million, respectively. The Company has programs in place to improve claims experience, such as disciplined claim and insurance litigation management and a focused approach to workplace safety.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating insurance reserves for the years presented. There are currently no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur that would materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best estimate of taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to various international, federal, state and local income taxes in jurisdictions where the Company operates. In determining income tax expense, the Company makes its best estimate of the annual effective income tax rate at the end of each quarter and applies that rate to year-to-date income (loss) before income taxes to arrive at the year-to-date income tax provision (exclusive of loss jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is realizable with any discrete tax items recorded separately). At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's annual effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was (8.4)%, 79.5% and 214.8%, respectively.\nCritical Estimate-Income Taxes\nAnnual effective income tax rates are estimated by giving recognition to currently enacted tax rates, tax holidays, tax credits, capital losses, and tax deductions as well as certain exempt income and non-deductible expenses for all jurisdictions where the Company operates. Quarterly income tax provisions incorporate any change in the year-to-date provision from the previous quarterly periods.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determinations, the Company considers all available evidence, including future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, feasible and prudent tax planning strategies and recent financial operating results. In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made that would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nValuation allowances of $146.1 million and $110.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related principally to deferred tax assets for U.K. pension liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, capital losses, currency translation and foreign investment tax credits that are uncertain as to realizability. In 2016, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of\n$16.1 million related to loss on sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand, $13.5 million related to estimated forward loss provisions related to the SBB contracts, and current year pension adjustments of $19.2 million recorded through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. This was partially offset by the reduction from the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments and the decrease related to U.K. and France tax rate changes. In 2015, the Company recorded a net decrease in the valuation allowance of $16.1 million related to current year pension adjustments recorded through Accumulated other comprehensive loss, the current year decrease from the currency translation in the amount of $11.5 million, and\n$6.3 million decrease related to a U.K. tax rate change. This was offset by a net increase of $13.2 million related to losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on its technical merits. The unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively, excluding accrued interest and penalties. The unrecognized tax benefit may decrease as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations or as a result of final settlement and resolution of outstanding tax matters in various state and international jurisdictions.\nThe Company has not provided U.S. income taxes on certain non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings, as such amounts are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The Company evaluates future financial projections for its most significant subsidiaries, the need to reinvest earnings locally and the overall cash requirements of the Company. Based upon this evaluation, the Company determined that certain undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. The Company believes that it can generate sufficient cash flows to avoid the one-time tax costs associated with repatriation of undistributed earnings to the U.S. from prior periods. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, such earnings were approximately $528 million and $547 million, respectively. It is not practical to determine the deferred income tax liability on these earnings if, in the future, they are remitted to the U.S. because the income tax liability to be incurred, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions for the years presented or for quarterly periods.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Harsco Corporation (the \"Company\") provided under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmounts included in this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are rounded in millions and all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts. As a result, minor differences may exist due to rounding.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe nature of the Company's business and the many countries in which it operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In accordance with the \"safe harbor\" provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company provides the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward-looking statements, including the expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Forward-looking statements contained herein could include, among other things, statements about management's confidence in and strategies for performance; expectations for new and existing products, technologies and opportunities; and expectations regarding growth, sales, cash flows, and earnings. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of such terms as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"likely,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan\" or other comparable terms.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in the worldwide business environment in which the Company operates, including general economic conditions; (2) changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity and fuel costs and capital costs;(3) changes in the performance of equity and bond markets that could affect, among other things, the valuation of the assets in the Company's pension plans and the accounting for pension assets, liabilities and expenses; (4) changes in governmental laws and regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety, tax and import tariff standards; (5) market and competitive changes, including pricing pressures, market demand and acceptance for new products, services and technologies; (6) the Company's inability or failure to protect its intellectual property rights from infringement in one or more of the many countries in which the Company operates; (7) failure to effectively prevent, detect or recover from breaches in the Company's cybersecurity infrastructure; (8) unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of the many countries in which the Company operates due to political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities, public health issues or other calamities; (9) disruptions associated with labor disputes and increased operating costs associated with union organization; (10) the seasonal nature of the Company's business; (11) the Company's ability to successfully enter into new contracts and complete new acquisitions or strategic ventures in the time-frame contemplated, or at all; (12) the integration of the Company's strategic acquisitions; (13) the amount and timing of repurchases of the Company's common stock, if any; (14) the prolonged recovery in global financial and credit markets and economic conditions generally, which could result in the Company's customers curtailing development projects, construction, production and capital expenditures, which, in turn, could reduce the demand for the Company's products and services and, accordingly, the Company's revenues, margins and profitability; (15) the outcome of any disputes with customers, contractors and subcontractors; (16) the financial condition of the Company's customers, including the ability of customers (especially those that may be highly leveraged and those with inadequate liquidity) to maintain their credit availability; (17) the Company's ability to successfully implement and receive the expected benefits of cost-reduction and restructuring initiatives, including the achievement of expected cost savings in the expected time frame; (18) implementation of environmental remediation matters; (19) risk and uncertainty associated with intangible assets; (20) the impact of a transaction, if any, resulting from the Company's determination to explore strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; and (21) other risk factors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. A further discussion of these, along with other potential risk factors, can be found in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company cautions that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. The Company undertakes no duty to update forward-looking statements except as may be required by law.\nExecutive Overview\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a new senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d), consisting of a $400 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $550 million term loan B facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\"). Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the 5.75% Senior Notes due 2018 (the Notes\u201d) in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Financing Agreements and the Notes. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nIn September 2016, the Company sold its remaining approximate 26% equity interest in Brand Energy & Infrastructure Services (\"Brand\"). In exchange for the Company's interest, (i) the Company received $145 million in cash, net, and (ii) the requirement for the Company to fund certain obligations to Brand through 2018 were satisfied, the present value of which equaled $20.6 million. As a result of the sale, the Company's obligation to make quarterly payments related to the unit adjustment liability under the terms of a limited partnership agreement that governed the operation of the strategic venture terminated. The Company recognized a loss on the sale of its equity interest in Brand in the amount of $43.5 million, which was recognized in Change in fair value to unit adjustment liability and loss on dilution and sale of equity method investment on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nAlthough steel markets have demonstrated some improvement, the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment continued to be negatively impacted by lower customer steel production, weak commodity prices and site exits during 2016. These impacts have been offset by the savings and benefits achieved as part of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment's Improvement Plan (\"Project Orion\") including lower compensation costs and the impact of exited underperforming contracts. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Project Orion was expanded with additional targeted workforce and operational savings of $20 million to $25 million. The majority of these benefits were realized during 2016. See Note 19, Restructuring Programs, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. Also, results for 2015 included costs incurred by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment related to a steel mill customer liquidation, salt cake disposal costs and charges associated with a subcontractor settlement which decreased operating income by $24.9 million. The Company remains focused on achieving additional cost reductions and operational improvements to enhance returns for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nThe Harsco Rail Segment recorded estimated forward loss provision of $45.1 million during 2016 related to the Company's contracts with the federal railway system of Switzerland (\"SBB\"). The estimated forward loss provision resulted from increased vendor costs, ongoing discussions with SBB, and increased estimates for commissioning, certification and testing costs, as well as expected settlements with SBB. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. Also, results for 2015 included a $10.9 million foreign exchange gain that was not repeated in 2016. Additionally, the Harsco Rail Segment continues to be impacted by continued weakness in the North American market.\nWhile energy markets have demonstrated some fundamental improvement, the Harsco Industrial Segment's air-cooled heat exchangers and industrial grating businesses will lag the market given the lead time for capital expenditures to formalize into new projects for customers in the upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas markets served by the Company to be constrained. Accordingly, these factors are expected to impact revenue and operating income during the first half of 2017 in the Harsco Industrial Segment.\nThe Company has announced its intention to pursue strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment from the rest of the Company. A separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment would allow each of the Company's businesses to benefit from dedicated capital structures; execute tailored and flexible strategic priorities; and optimize capital return policies consistent with each business's unique priorities. There is no specific timetable related to this initiative and there can be no assurance that a sale, spin-off or any other transaction will take place. The Company incurred $3.3 million and $9.9 million of expenses during 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the separation, which are included as part of Corporate in the Company's segment results.\nRevenues by Segment\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Metals & Minerals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>965.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,106.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(140.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Rail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,451.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,723.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(271.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues by Region\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Western Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(70.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>654.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>807.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(153.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eastern Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,451.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,723.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(271.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes Mexico.

Overall, steel production by customers under services contracts, including the impact of exited contracts, decreased by 10% for 2016 compared with the prior year. Excluding the impact of exited contracts, steel production by customers under services contracts decreased by 2% for 2016 compared with the prior year. \n \u2022 Decreased income attributable to the impact of lost contracts and reduced nickel prices and demand. Nickel prices decreased 20% during 2016 compared with the prior year. \n \u2022 Severance costs resulting from a probable site exit decreased operating income by $5.1 million during 2016. \nHarsco Industrial Segment:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant Impacts on Revenues (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues-2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impacts of price/volume changes, primarily attributable to volume changes.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of foreign currency translation.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>247.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Positively Affecting Operating Income:\n \u2022 Operating income was aided by $9.1 million of lower selling, general and administrative costs in 2016 compared with the prior year. \n \u2022 The effect of delivering the Mexico City International Airport security fencing order in 2016. \nFactors Negatively Impacting Operating Income:\n \u2022 Lower overall volumes in the air-cooled heat exchangers business, resulting in decreased operating income during 2016. These lower volumes are primarily attributable to lower energy prices which impacted capital spending by customers in the oil and natural gas industries served by the Company. \n \u2022 Lower volumes and higher material costs in the industrial grating products business. \n \u2022 2015 included gains from sales of assets of $3.6 million which did not repeat during 2016. \nHarsco Rail Segment:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant Impacts on Revenues (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues-2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impact of price/volume changes, primarily attributable to volume changes.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of foreign currency translation.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Positively Affecting Operating Income (Loss):\n \u2022 Increased sales of international equipment, spare parts and safety equipment. \n \u2022 Operating income (loss) was aided by $1.4 million of lower selling, general and administrative costs in 2016 compared with the prior year. \nFactors Negatively Impacting Operating Income (Loss):\n \u2022 During 2016, the Harsco Rail Segment recorded an estimated forward loss provision of $45.1 million related to the Company's contracts with SBB. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. \n \u2022 Foreign currency gain of $10.9 million recognized during 2015 which did not repeat in 2016. \n \u2022 Decreased volumes in North America and a less favorable mix of equipment sales decreased operating income (loss) during 2016 compared with the prior year. \n \u2022 Lower volumes and higher costs for contract services decreased operating income (loss) during 2016 compared with the prior year. \nOutlook, Trends and Strategies\nDespite uncertainties in the global economy, along with the persistent challenges of global steel production and related pricing, as well as low oil prices, the Company believes it is positioned to execute actions through a disciplined focus on return-based capital allocations and business portfolio strategies. The Company believes these actions will enable it to generate returns above its cost of capital with a balanced business portfolio without endangering its financial profile with unreasonable leverage.\nThese business portfolio strategies will continue to focus on improving the performance of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment while pursuing select growth opportunities as global steel markets recover. For the Harsco Rail and Harsco Industrial Segments, the Company will focus on disciplined growth organically, and through acquisitions, that improve these businesses' competitive positions in core or adjacent markets. The Company will continue to pursue cost-reduction and efficiency initiatives, including Continuous Improvement, which have significantly reduced, and are expected to continue to reduce, the Company's cost structure and further enhance its financial strength without diminishing its services and products capabilities. As part of these initiatives, the Company will continue to focus on maintaining an active, lean corporate center that optimizes corporate costs while continuing to develop value added activities to support the Company.\nThe Company's expansion into targeted growth markets; its diversity of services and products in industries that are fundamental to global growth; its long-term mill services and minerals supply contracts; its differentiated technologies and innovations; its return based capital allocations and business portfolio strategies; and its focus on executing cost reduction and efficiency initiatives, help mitigate the Company's overall long-term exposure to changes in the economic outlook in any single economy or industry. However, deterioration of global economies and industries could still have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe following significant items, risks, trends and strategies are expected to affect the Company in 2017 and beyond:\n \u2022 The Company will focus on providing returns above its cost of capital for its stockholders by balancing its portfolio of businesses, and by executing its strategic and operational practices with reasonable amounts of financial leverage. \n \u2022 The Company will continue to build and develop strong core capabilities and maintain an active and lean corporate center that balances costs with value added services. \n \u2022 The Company will assess capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives. Management will be selective and disciplined in allocating capital by rigorously analyzing projects and utilizing a return-based capital allocation process. \n \u2022 The Company expects its operational effective income tax rate to approximate 39% to 41% in 2017. \n \u2022 The potential consequences related to uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's proposed exit from the European Union may have an impact on the Company results of operations, cash flows and asset valuations in any period particularly in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information. \nHarsco Metals & Minerals Segment:\n \u2022 Steel markets demonstrated some pricing improvement during 2016 and the Company expects modest improvements in demand, the effect of new contracts, the continued benefits achieved as part of Project Orion and additional improvement initiatives to positively affect operating income in the near term in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment. These improvements will be partially offset by possible site exits and the anticipated impact of foreign currency translation. \n \u2022 In addition to the benefits and discipline that resulted from Project Orion, the Company will continue to focus on ensuring that forecasted profits and other requirements for contracts meet certain established standards and deliver returns above its cost of capital. In connection with this focus, the possibility exists that the Company may take strategic actions that result in exit costs and non-cash asset impairment charges that may have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and liquidity. \n \u2022 In February 2016, the Company announced a new 15-year contract with China's largest steel maker with anticipated revenues totaling approximately $125 million over the life of the contract. In March 2016, the Company secured a contract extension for steel mill services in Belgium with projected revenues totaling more than $100 million. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company announced expanded services with Chile's largest steelmaker and a new contract in Egypt with projected revenues totaling more than $40 million and $35 million, respectively. In November 2016, the Company announced a multi-year expansion of steel mill services at a North American customer with projected revenues totaling more than $50 million. Additionally, the Company recently announced two multi-year contracts for steel mill services in China and Brazil with projected revenues totaling more than $100 million. \n \u2022 As the Company has previously disclosed, over the past several years the Company has been in discussions with officials at the Supreme Council for Environment in Bahrain (\"Bahrain Council\") with regard to a processing by-product (\"salt cakes\") located at Hafeera. During 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $7.0 million, payable over five to seven years, related to the estimated cost of processing and disposal of the salt cakes. The Company's Bahrain operations are operated under a strategic venture for which its strategic venture partner has a 35% minority interest. The Company is awaiting final approval from the Bahrain Council regarding the proposed processing and disposal method. If the Bahrain Council does not approve the proposed method or mandates alternative solutions, the Company's estimated liability could change, and such change could be material in any one period. \n \u2022 During 2016, one of the Company's customers announced its intention to conduct a strategic review of its steel making operations in Europe, including the possibility of strategic collaborations through a joint venture with another major steel maker. Depending on the outcome of any potential transactions, there could be a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and asset valuations in any one period. \n \u2022 One of the Company's customers in Australia has begun the process of voluntary administration under Australian law, the purpose of which is to focus on long-term solvency. The customer is continuing its operations during the voluntary administration proceedings. The Company had approximately $5 million of receivables with the customer prior to the start of the voluntary administration and continues to believe that these amounts are collectible, because the Company is viewed as an important supplier, continues to provide services to the customer and continues to collect on post-administration invoices timely. However the administration process is uncertain in nature and length. No additional creditors' meeting is scheduled at this time. As such, a loss on the pre-administration receivables is reasonably possible, and if there was a change in the Company's view on collectability, there could be a charge against income in future periods. Moreover, if the site were to close, additional costs may be incurred and asset valuations may be impacted, which may be significant in any one period. \nHarsco Industrial Segment:\n \u2022 While energy markets have demonstrated some fundamental improvement, the Harsco Industrial Segment's air-cooled heat exchangers and industrial grating businesses will lag the market given the lead time for capital expenditures to formalize into new projects for customers in the upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas markets served by the Company to be constrained. Accordingly, these factors are expected to impact revenue and operating income during the first half of 2017 in the Harsco Industrial Segment. \n \u2022 The Company is committed to maintaining recent efficiency gains in the air-cooled heat exchangers and industrial grating products businesses and implementing additional improvements in response to the recent industry and economic challenges. \n \u2022 The Company will continue to focus on product innovation and development to drive strategic growth in its businesses. During 2016, the Company introduced GrateGuardTM, a new fencing solution for first-line physical security in the Industrial grating business. Additionally, the Company recently announced the launch of an all-new capability for remote indoor boiler monitoring that can be downloaded directly to wireless and desktop devices. \n \u2022 The Company will focus on growing the Harsco Industrial Segment through disciplined organic expansion and acquisitions that improve competitive positioning in core markets or adjacent markets. \nHarsco Rail Segment:\n \u2022 The global demand for railway maintenance-of-way equipment, parts and services continues to be generally positive, though the North American market is experiencing weakness due to reduced capital and operating spending by Class I railways. \n \u2022 During April 2016, the Company was awarded a multi-year rail grinding services contract extension in the U.K. with anticipated revenues of at least $38 million. During December 2016, the Company announced new sales of railway track grinders for use in contract rail grinding programs throughout North America. Additionally, during January 2017, the Company announced a new order to equip the entire Denver, Colorado regional railway fleet with enhanced safety systems. \n \u2022 In prior years, the Company secured two contract awards with initial contract values totaling approximately $200 million from SBB. The majority of deliveries under these contracts are anticipated to occur during 2017 through 2020. The Harsco Rail Segment recorded estimated forward loss provisions of $40.1 million and $5.0 million during the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively, which resulted from increased vendor costs, ongoing discussions with SBB, and increased estimates for commissioning, certification and testing costs, as well as expected settlements with SBB. It is possible that the Company's overall estimate of costs to complete these contracts may increase which would result in an additional estimated forward loss provision at such time. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. \n \u2022 The Company will focus on growing the Harsco Rail Segment through disciplined organic expansion and acquisitions that improve competitive positioning in core markets or adjacent markets. \nResults of Operations\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per share information and percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,451.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,723.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,066.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services and products sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,170.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,356.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,643.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on disposal of the Harsco Infrastructure Segment and transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value to the unit adjustment liability and loss on dilution and sale of equity method investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other comprehensive income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(163.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total comprehensive income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(180.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted income (loss) per common share from continuing operations attributable to Harsco Corporation common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.07\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate for continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparative Analysis of Consolidated Results\nTotal Revenues\nRevenues for 2016 decreased $271.9 million or 16% from 2015.

This decrease was primarily related to the impact of reduced bad debt expense in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; decreased agent and broker commissions in the Harsco Industrial Segment due to lower volume; and foreign currency translation. Additionally, results for 2016 were also impacted by lower pension expense, professional fees and compensation costs associated with Project Orion in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment and travel costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 decreased $42.6 million or 15% from 2014. This decrease was primarily related to the impact of lower compensation costs associated with Project Orion in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, foreign currency translation, lower professional fees, and decreased agent and broker commissions in the Harsco Rail and Industrial Segments, partially offset by increased bad debt expense due principally to a Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment's steel mill customer liquidation.\nLoss on Disposal of the Harsco Infrastructure Segment and Transaction Costs\nThe Company recorded a loss on disposal of the Harsco Infrastructure Segment and related transaction costs of $1.0 million and $5.1 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Additional information on Other expenses is included in Note 17, Other Expenses, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax Other expenses of $12.6 million, $30.6 million and $57.8 million, respectively. The major components of this income statement caption are as follows:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other (Income) Expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,718\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee termination benefits costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other costs to exit activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impaired asset write-downs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency gains related to Harsco Rail Segment advances on contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,940\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment separation costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subcontractor settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(467\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\n2016 vs. 2015\nInterest expense in 2016 was $51.6 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 10% compared with 2015. The increase primarily relates to $1.1 million of deferred financing costs expensed by the Company during the third quarter of 2016 related to payments for the Term Loan Facility and increased interest rates associated with the Company's borrowings, as well as other financing costs partially offset by lower debt levels. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\n2015 vs. 2014\nInterest expense in 2015 was $46.8 million, a decrease of $0.3 million or 1% compared with 2014. There were no individually significant items related to the change in this Statement of Operations caption.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a New Credit Facility, consisting of a $400 million revolving credit facility and a $550 million term loan B facility. Upon closing of the New Credit Facility, the Company has amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing Term Loan Facility and has redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nChange in Fair Value to the Unit Adjustment Liability and Loss on Dilution and Sale of Equity Method Investment\nThe Change in fair value to the unit adjustment liability and loss on dilution and sale of equity method investment during 2016 increased $50.0 million compared with 2015. The increase relates to the loss associated with Company's first quarter of 2016 election not to make the quarterly cash payments to the Company's partner in the Infrastructure strategic venture for the remainder of 2016 and the Company's third quarter of 2016 sale of its remaining equity interest in the Infrastructure strategic venture. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments and Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nIncome Tax Expense from Continuing Operations\n2016 vs. 2015\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations in 2016 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $21.0 million compared with 2015. The effective income tax rate relating to continued operations for 2016 was (8.4)% versus 79.5% for 2015. The decrease in income tax expense and the change in the effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was primarily due to the change in the mix in earnings between international jurisdictions and the non-recurring loss on early extinguishment of debt. Additionally, there was no income tax benefit realized from the loss on the sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand, as a valuation allowance of $16.1 million was established to offset the deferred tax assets on the resulting capital loss carryforward. There was also no income tax benefit realized from the estimated forward loss provisions related to the SBB contracts, as a valuation allowance of $13.5 million was established to offset the deferred tax assets on the resulting loss carryforward, because the Company determined that it is not more likely than not that these benefits will be realized in the future.\n2015 vs. 2014\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations in 2015 was $27.7 million, a decrease of $2.7 million compared with 2014 and the effective income tax rate relating to continued operations for 2015 was 79.5% versus 214.8% for 2014. The decrease in income tax expense and the change in the effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was primarily due to a reduction in restructuring and asset impairment charges in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment for which no tax benefit was recorded.\nSee Note 11, Income Taxes, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nTotal Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n2016 vs. 2015\nTotal other comprehensive loss was $93.6 million in 2016, compared with total other comprehensive income of $13.9 million in 2015. The major drivers for this change were pension liability adjustments and foreign currency translation adjustments. The pension liability adjustments were the result of lower global weighted average discount rates, principally for the U.K. plan, which decreased from 3.9% to 3.1% during the year. This was partially offset by actual returns on plan assets that were higher than expected returns. Foreign currency translation adjustments were negatively impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n2015 vs. 2014\nTotal other comprehensive income was $13.9 million in 2015, compared with total other comprehensive loss of $163.2 million in 2014. The major drivers for this change were pension liability adjustments, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments. The pension liability adjustments were the result of higher global weighted average discount rates that increased from 3.7% to 3.9% during the year, partially offset by actual returns on plan assets that were less than the expected returns. Foreign currency translation adjustments were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of a $400 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $550 million Term Loan Facility. Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Financing Agreements and the Notes, and is reflected in the financing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a reduction of long-term debt.\nThe Company has sufficient financial liquidity and borrowing capacity to support the strategies within each of our businesses. The Company currently expects operational and business needs to be met by cash provided by operations supplemented with borrowings from time to time due to historical patterns of seasonal cash flow and for the funding of various projects. The Company continues to assess its capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives.\nThe Company continues to implement and perform capital efficiency initiatives to enhance liquidity and working capital efficiency. These initiatives have included: prudent allocation of capital spending to those projects where the highest results can be achieved; optimization of worldwide cash positions; reductions in discretionary spending; frequent evaluation of customer and business-partner credit risk; and Continuous Improvement initiatives aimed at improving the effective and efficient use of working capital, particularly in accounts receivable and inventories.\nDuring 2016, the Company generated $159.8 million in operating cash flow, an increase from the $121.5 million generated in 2015.\nIn 2016, the Company invested $69.3 million in capital expenditures, mostly for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, compared with $123.6 million in 2015. The Company generated $9.3 million in cash flow from asset sales in 2016 compared with $26.0 million in 2015. Asset sales have been a normal part of the Company's business model, primarily for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nIn September 2016, the Company received approximately $145 million in cash, net, from the sale of its remaining 26% equity interest in Brand. In 2016, the Company received proceeds from the termination of cross-currency interest rate swaps (\"CCIRs\") of $16.6 million compared with $75.1 million in 2015. The Company paid $4.1 million and $65.7 million in dividends to stockholders in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has suspended the quarterly dividend to preserve financial flexibility. The Board of Directors (the \"Board\") will continue to evaluate the Company's dividend policy each quarter.\nThe Company's net cash borrowings decreased by $261.2 million in 2016 principally due to the utilization of operating cash flows, proceeds from the termination of CCIRs and proceeds from the sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand. The Company's consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") ratio, as defined by the Credit Agreement, was 2.3 to 1.0 at December 31, 2016.\nCash Requirements\nThe following summarizes the Company's expected future payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2016:\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments at December 31, 2016 (a)\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nyears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (including current maturities and capital leases)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>673.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected interest payments on long-term debt (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension obligations (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (non-cancellable)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cross-currency interest rate swaps (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange forward contracts (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations (g)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,118.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>596.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements; Note 9, Operating Leases; Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans; Note 11, Income Taxes; and Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information on short-term borrowings and long-term debt (including capital leases); operating leases; employee benefit plans; income taxes; CCIRs and foreign currency exchange forward contracts, respectively. \n (b) The total projected interest payments on long-term debt are based upon borrowings, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2016. The interest rates on variable-rate debt and the foreign currency exchange rates are subject to changes beyond the Company's control and may result in actual interest expense and payments differing from the amounts projected above. \n (c) Amounts represent expected employer contributions to defined benefit pension plans for the next year. \n (d) Purchase obligations represent legally binding obligations to purchase property, plant and equipment, inventory and other commitments made in the normal course of business to meet operations requirements. \n (e) Due to the nature of these CCIRs, based on December 31, 2016 fair values there would be net cash received of $0.4 million comprised of cash payments of $2.3 million and cash receipts of $2.7 million. Accordingly, no amounts are included in the above table. The CCIRs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. \n (f) Amounts represent the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2016. Due to the nature of these contracts, based on fair values at December 31, 2016 there will be net cash received of $1.4 million comprised of cash payments of $600.9 million and cash receipts of $602.3 million. Accordingly, no amounts are included in the above table. The foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance sheets at fair value. \n (g) At December 31, 2016, in addition to the above contractual obligations, the Company had $5.7 million of potential long-term tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these potential long-term tax liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contingent commercial commitments at December 31, 2016. These amounts are not included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since there are no current circumstances known to management indicating that the Company will be required to make payments on these contingent commercial commitments.\nCommercial Commitments at December 31, 2016\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commercial Commitment Expiration Per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Indefinite\nExpiration\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commercial commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>195.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain commercial commitments that are of a continuous nature do not have an expiration date and are therefore considered to be indefinite in nature. See Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under its Senior Secured Credit Facility, augmented by cash proceeds from asset sales. The primary drivers of the Company's cash flow from operations are the Company's revenues and income. Cash returns on capital investments made in the prior years, for which limited cash is currently required, are a significant source of cash provided by operations. Depreciation expense related to these investments is a non-cash charge.\nThe Company plans to redeploy discretionary cash for potential growth opportunities, such as disciplined organic growth and higher-return service contracts opportunities for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, and strategic investments or possible acquisitions in the Harsco Rail and Harsco Industrial Segments that improve competitive positioning in core markets or adjacent markets.\nResources Available for Cash Requirements for Operational and Growth Initiatives\nIn addition to utilizing cash provided by operations and cash proceeds from asset sales, the Company has bank credit facilities available throughout the world. The Company also utilizes capital leases to finance the acquisition of certain equipment when appropriate, which allows the Company to minimize capital expenditures. The Company expects to continue to utilize all these sources to meet future cash requirements for operations and growth initiatives.\nOn December 2, 2015, the Company entered into (i) an amendment and restatement agreement and (ii) a second amended and restated credit agreement (together, the Financing Agreements\u201d). The Financing Agreements increased the Company's overall borrowing capacity from $500 million to $600 million by (i) amending and restating the Company's then existing credit agreement, (ii) establishing a term loan A facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $250 million, by converting a portion of the outstanding balance under the then existing credit agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis and (iii) reducing the Revolving Credit Facility limit to $350 million.\nDuring September 2016, the Company received approximately $145 million in cash, net, from its sale of its remaining 26% equity interest in the Infrastructure strategic venture. The Company used these proceeds to repay $85.0 million on the term loan A facility and $60.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. Related to the repayment of the term loan A facility, the Company expensed $1.1 million of previously deferred financing costs.\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 87.5 to 200 basis points over the base rate or 187.5 to 300 basis points over the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility (the \"Credit Agreement\"). Any principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility is due and payable on the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on November 2, 2021.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 375 to 400 basis points over the base rate or 475 to 500 basis points over the adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to a 1% floor, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments, beginning in March 2017, each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the loans under the Term Loan Facility. These payments are reduced by the application of any prepayments, and any remaining balance is due and payable on the maturity of the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility matures on November 2, 2023.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility imposes certain restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions as to types and amounts of debt and liens that may be incurred by the Company; limitations on increases in dividend payments and limitations on certain acquisitions by the Company.\nThe obligations of the Company are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries ( Guarantors\u201d). All obligations under the Senior Credit Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Guarantors.\nIn January 2017, the Company entered into a series of fixed-floating interest rate swaps that cover the period from 2018 through 2021, and had the effect of converting $300 million of the Term Loan Facility from floating-rate to fixed-rate. The fixed rates provided by the swaps replace the adjusted LIBOR rate in the interest calculation, range from 1.65% for 2018 to 2.71% for 2021.\nThe following table illustrates available credit at December 31, 2016: Table 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facility Limit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available\nCredit\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-year revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had $648.0 million of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility consisting of $550.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and $98.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, of this balance, $642.5 million was classified as long-term debt and $5.5 million was classified as current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $415.0 million of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisting of $250.0 million under the term loan A facility and $165.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2015, of this balance, $380.5 million was classified as long-term debt,\n$22.0 million was classified as short-term borrowings and $12.5 million was classified as current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information on the Company's Credit Agreement.\nWorking Capital Position\nChanges in the Company's working capital are reflected in the following table:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other receivables, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>577.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>664.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings and current maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances on contracts and other customer advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due to unconsolidated affiliate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unit adjustment liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Ratio (h)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (h) Calculated as Current assets / Current liabilities  Working capital decreased $8.7 million or 5.5% in 2016 due primarily to the following factors:\n \u2022 Working capital was negatively impacted by a decrease in Inventory of $29.3 million, primarily due to the estimated forward loss provisions related to the Company's Harsco Rail Segment's contracts with SBB which is recorded as a reduction of Contracts-in-process, a component of Inventory, as well as the timing of inventory purchases in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; \n \u2022 Working capital was negatively impacted by a decrease in Other current assets of $22.0 million, primarily due to the timing of current deferred tax assets and prepaid expenses; \n \u2022 Working capital was negatively impacted by a decrease in Trade accounts receivable, net, of $18.3 million, primarily due to timing of invoicing and collections in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, foreign currency translation and decreased sales in the Harsco Industrial Segment; and \n \u2022 Working capital was negatively impacted by an increase in Advances on contracts and other customer advances of $10.1 million, primarily received in the Harsco Rail Segment. \nThese working capital decreases were partially offset by the following factors:\n \u2022 Working capital was positively affected by a decrease in Accounts payable of $28.1 million, primarily due to the timing of payments; \n \u2022 Working capital was positively affected by a decrease in Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt of $25.5 million, primarily due to the expected timing of debt payments; \n \u2022 Working capital was positively affected by a decrease in the Unit adjustment liability of $22.3 million due to the sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments and Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information; and \n \u2022 Working capital was positively affected by a decrease in Other current liabilities of $12.3 million, primarily due to lower accrued commissions, lower accrued interest and the timing of other accruals. \nCertainty of Cash Flows\nThe certainty of the Company's future cash flows is underpinned by the long-term nature of the Company's metals services contracts, the order backlog for the Company's railway track maintenance services and equipment, and overall discretionary cash flows (operating cash flows plus cash from asset sales in excess of the amounts necessary for capital expenditures to maintain current revenue levels) generated by the Company. Historically, the Company has utilized these discretionary cash flows for growth-related capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment and dividend payments.\nThe types of products and services that the Company provides are not subject to rapid technological change, which increases the stability of related cash flows. Additionally, the Company believes each business in its portfolio is a leader in the industries and major markets the Company serves. Due to these factors, the Company is confident in the Company's future ability to generate positive cash flows from operations.\nThe Company has historically generated the majority of its cash flows in the second half of the year. Additionally, the Company's cash flows have been negatively impacted in the near term by reduced steel production, weaker commodity prices and demand, the impact of site exits in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment and low oil prices impacting capital expenditures and overall spending by customers in the natural gas, natural gas processing and petrochemical industries.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided (used) by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(229.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(292.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $159.8 million, an increase of $38.3 million from 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to timing in inventory purchases, increases in accrued compensation and increases on advances on contracts; partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable invoicing and collections and the timing of accounts payables. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was $121.5 million, a decrease of $105.2 million from 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower customer advances, and an increase in inventory primarily related to the SBB contracts in the Harsco Rail Segment, partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable invoicing and collections.\nIncluded in the Cash flows from operating activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is the caption, Other, net. In 2015, this caption included the Harsco Rail Segment foreign exchange gain which is reflected in the Effect of exchange rate changes on cash. In 2014, this caption consisted of principally the impact of non-cash impaired asset write-downs related to the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nAlso included in the Cash flows from operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is the caption, Other assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the decreases in this caption were\n$12.8 million, $6.0 million and $17.1 million, respectively. A summary of the major components of this caption for the periods presented is as follows: Table 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Change in prepaid expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Change in non-current insurance accruals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(i)\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (i) Other relates primarily to other accruals that are individually not significant. \nCash provided (used) by investing activities - Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was $122.9 million, an increase of $253.3 million from 2015. The increase is primarily due to the gross proceeds received from the sale of the Company's remaining 26% equity interest in Brand; a lower level of capital expenditures in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, no payments for the unit adjustment liability; and an increase related to foreign currency hedge settlements reported as Other investing activities. In 2015, net cash used by investing activities was $130.4 million, a decrease of\n$99.2 million from 2014. The net decrease was primarily due to a lower level of capital expenditures, primarily in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; a net decrease in purchases of businesses which consisted of Protran and JK Rail in the Harsco Rail Segment in 2015 and Hammco in the Harsco Industrial Segment in 2014; and an increase in proceeds from sales of assets, partially offset by the final working capital adjustment related to the Infrastructure Transaction which was received in 2014. Capital investments decreased $85.3 million compared with 2014.\nCash provided (used) by financing activities - Net cash used by financing activities in 2016 was $292.3 million, an increase of $314.7 million from 2015. The change was primarily due to net cash payments on debt of $261.2 million in 2016 compared with $47.3 million in 2015; reduction in proceeds from the termination of CCIRs and a deferred pension underfunding payment related to the Company's equity interest in Brand; partially offset by lower dividends paid and no repurchases of the Company's common stock in 2016. In 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.5 million, an increase of $44.2 million from 2014. The change was primarily due to proceeds of $75.1 million from the termination of a CCIR, partially offset by an increase in the treasury shares purchased under the Company's share repurchase program then in effect and a decrease in year-over-year net cash borrowings.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Credit Agreement contains a consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant, which is not to exceed 4.0 to 1.0, and a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges ratio covenant, which is not to be less than 3.0 to 1.0. The consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant is reduced to 3.75 to1.0 after December 31, 2016 and to 3.5 to 1.0 after December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with these covenants as the net leverage ratio was 2.3 to 1.0 and interest coverage ratio was 5.1 to 1.0. Based on balances and covenants in effect at December 31, 2016, the Company could increase net debt by $447.6 million (although the Company only has $258.5 million available credit remaining under the Revolving Credit Facility), and still be in compliance with these debt covenants. Alternatively, keeping all other factors constant, the Company's adjusted EBITDA could decrease by $109.1 million and the Company would still be within these debt covenants. The Company expects to continue to be in compliance with these debt covenants for at least the next twelve months.\nCash Management\nThe Company has various cash management systems throughout the world that centralize cash in various bank accounts where it is economically justifiable and legally permissible to do so. These centralized cash balances are then redeployed to other operations to reduce short-term borrowings and to finance working capital needs or capital expenditures. Due to the transitory nature of cash balances, they are normally invested in bank deposits that can be withdrawn at will or in very liquid short-term bank time deposits and government obligations. The Company's policy is to use the largest banks in the various countries in which the Company operates. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of banks and when appropriate will adjust banking operations to reduce or eliminate exposure to less credit-worthy banks. The Company plans to continue the strategy of targeted, prudent investing for strategic purposes for the foreseeable future and to make more efficient use of existing investments.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents included $70.5 million held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, less than 10% of the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents had regulatory restrictions that would preclude the transfer of funds with and among subsidiaries. The cash and cash equivalents held by non-U.S. subsidiaries also included $26.7 million held in consolidated strategic ventures. The strategic venture agreements may require strategic venture partner approval to transfer funds with and among subsidiaries. While the Company's remaining non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents can be transferred with and among subsidiaries, the majority of these non-U.S. cash balances will be used to support the ongoing working capital needs and continued growth of the Company's non-U.S. operations.\nThe Company's financial position and debt capacity should enable it to meet current and future requirements. The Company continues to assess its capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates, including those related to defined benefit pension benefits, notes and accounts receivable, goodwill, long-lived asset impairment, inventories, revenue recognition - long-term contracts, insurance reserves and income taxes. The impact of changes in these estimates, as necessary, is reflected in the respective segment's results of operations in the period of the change. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different outcomes, assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by the Company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the Audit Committee of the Board and they have reviewed the Company's disclosures relating to these estimates in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These items should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nDefined Benefit Pension Benefits\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans in several countries. The largest of these plans are in the U.K. and the U.S. The Company's funding policy for these plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding pursuant to U.K. and U.S. statutory requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate.\nChanges in the discount rate assumption and the actual performance of plan assets compared with the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are the primary drivers in the change in funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. These factors are components of actuarial loss (gain) and impact the amount recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss), as such actuarial changes are not reflected directly on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but amortized over time in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCritical Estimate-Defined Benefit Pension Benefits\nAccounting for defined benefit pension plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions. The principal assumptions used include the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Each assumption is reviewed annually and represents management's best estimate at that time. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time, and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of unfunded benefit obligation and the expense recognized.\nThe discount rates used in calculating the Company's projected benefit obligations at the December 31, 2016 measurement date for the U.K. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans were 2.7% and 4.0%, respectively, and the global weighted-average discount rate was 3.1%. The discount rates selected represent level-equivalent rates using the yield curve spot rates on a year-by-year expected cash flow basis, using yield curves of high-quality corporate bonds. Annual net periodic pension cost (\"NPPC\") is determined using the discount rates at the beginning of the year. The discount rates for 2016 expense were 3.8% for the U.K. plan, 4.2% for the U.S. plans and 3.9% for the global weighted-average of plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by evaluating the asset return expectations with the Company's advisors as well as actual, long-term, historical results of asset returns for the pension plans. Generally the NPPC increases as the expected long-term rate of return on assets decreases. For 2017 and 2016, the global weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption is 6.2% and 6.7%, respectively. This rate was determined based on a model of expected asset returns for an actively managed portfolio.\nChanges in NPPC may occur in the future due to changes in actuarial assumptions, and due to changes in returns on plan assets resulting from financial market conditions. Holding all other assumptions constant, using December 31, 2016 plan data, a one-quarter percent increase or decrease in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease annual 2016 pre-tax defined benefit NPPC as follows:\nApproximate Changes in Pre-tax Defined Benefit Net Periodic Pension Cost\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.K. Plan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-quarter percent increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase of $0.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease of $0.4 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-quarter percent decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease of $0.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase of $0.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-quarter percent increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease of $0.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease of $1.7 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-quarter percent decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase of $0.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase of $1.7 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncreases or decreases to the net pension obligations may be required should circumstances that affect these estimates change. Additionally, certain events could result in the pension obligation changing at a time other than the annual measurement date. This would occur when a benefit plan is amended or when plan curtailments or settlements occur.\nThe Company has changed the method utilized to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of NPPC for defined benefit pension plans for 2016 and later. The more precise application of discount rates for measuring both service costs and interest costs employs yield curve spot rates on a year-by-year expected cash flow basis, using the same yield curves that the Company has previously used. This change in method represented a change in accounting estimate and has been accounted for in the period of change. This change in method decreased the Company's NPPC by approximately $7 million for 2016, compared to what NPPC would have been under the prior method.\nSee Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nNotes and Accounts Receivable\nNotes and accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value through the use of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. The Company has policies and procedures in place requiring customers to be evaluated for creditworthiness prior to the execution of new service contracts or shipments of products. These reviews are structured to minimize the Company's risk related to realizability of receivables. Despite these policies and procedures, the Company may at times still experience collection problems and potential bad debts due to economic conditions within certain industries (e.g., steel industry), countries or regions in which the Company operates. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, trade accounts receivable of $236.6 million and $254.9 million, respectively, were net of reserves of $11.8 million and $25.6 million, respectively.\nCritical Estimate-Notes and Accounts Receivable\nA considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the realizability of receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer, related aging of past due balances and the facts and circumstances surrounding any non-payment. The Company did not make any significant provisions for bad debts during 2016. The Company's provisions for bad debts during 2015 and 2014 were $13.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively.\nOn a monthly basis, customer accounts are analyzed for collectability. Reserves are established based upon a specific-identification method as well as historical collection experience, as appropriate. The Company also evaluates specific accounts when it becomes aware of a situation in which a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration in financial condition, credit ratings, bankruptcy or receivership. The reserves are based on the facts available to the Company and are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available. Reserves are also determined by using percentages (based upon experience) applied to certain aged receivable categories. Specific issues are discussed with corporate management, and any significant changes in reserve amounts or the write-off of balances must be approved by specifically designated corporate personnel. All approved items are monitored to ensure they are recorded in the proper period. Additionally, any significant changes in reserve balances are reviewed to ensure the proper corporate approval has occurred.\nIf the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Conversely, an improvement in a customer's ability to make payments could result in a decrease of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to both of these situations would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the change was determined. As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a bad debt reserve of\n$2.6 million on receivables with a large steel mill customer who filed for protection under the Marzano Law. During the second quarter of 2014, the customer terminated its contract with the Company under the provisions of the Marzano Law. As a result, during the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded an additional bad debt reserve of $3.9 million on the remaining pre-receivership receivables with this customer. During 2014, the Company recorded a bad debt reserve of $2.6 million for one of its Canadian steel mill customers that filed for receivership protection during the course of the year as the Company has previously disclosed. The amount of the bad debt reserve for this customer represents the full pre-receivership balance. As previously disclosed during 2015, one of the Company's steel mill customers in Europe ceased operations and began a formal process of liquidation in late 2015. The Company had recorded bad debt reserves of approximately $13 million related to this customer during 2015.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating allowances for doubtful accounts for the years presented. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nGoodwill\nThe Company's goodwill balances were $382.3 million and $400.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1. The Company has five reporting units (only three of which have goodwill associated with them as of December 31, 2016). The Company's reporting units with goodwill are the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, the Harsco Rail Segment and the air-cooled heat exchanger business of the Harsco Industrial Segment. Almost all of the Company's goodwill is allocated to the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nCritical Estimate-Goodwill\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to dispose of a business. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include declining cash flows or operating losses at the reporting unit level, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, among others.\nThe evaluation of potential goodwill impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to the net book value, including goodwill. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model ( DCF model\u201d) to estimate the current fair value of reporting units, as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of current fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the preparation of DCF models, including future revenues and operating margin growth, the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d), tax rates, capital spending, pension funding, the impact of strategic business initiatives, and working capital projections. These assumptions and estimates may vary significantly among reporting units. DCF models are based on approved long-range plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections for later years. WACC rates are derived from internal and external factors including, but not limited to, the average market price of the Company's stock, shares outstanding, book value of the Company's debt, the long-term risk free interest rate, and both market and size-specific risk premiums. Due to the many variables noted above and the relative size of the Company's goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material impact on the results of the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing. If the net book value of a reporting unit were to exceed the current fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would currently be required to determine if an impairment existed and the amount of goodwill impairment to record, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the net book value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if it were to be acquired in a hypothetical business combination, and the current fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. The second step of the goodwill impairment test requires the utilization of valuation experts.\nThe performance of the Company's 2016 annual impairment tests did not result in any impairment of the Company's goodwill.\nFor the Company's 2016 annual goodwill impairment test, the average annual revenue growth rates over the duration of the DCF models ranged from 1.7% to 4.8%. The WACCs used in the 2016 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 9.25% to 10.75%.\nThe Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment reporting unit's fair value at October 1, 2016 was approximately 12% more than the net book value. Significant assumptions utilized in the DCF model include a WACC of 10.75%, an average annual revenue growth rate of 1.7% and average annual cash flow growth rate of 0.6%. Should there be degradation in the overall markets served by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, it may result in an impairment of the Harsco Metal & Minerals Segment goodwill.\nIt is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction, including the Company's announced intention to pursue strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment from the rest of the Company, could differ materially from those used to evaluate the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may be impaired. The amounts charged against pre-tax income from continuing operations related to impaired long-lived assets included in Other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were $0.4 million, $8.2 million and $39.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The decrease in long-lived asset impairments in 2016 was due primarily to a decreased number of site exits in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment upon substantial completion of actions associated with Project Orion. The decrease in long-lived asset impairments in 2015 was due primarily to higher long-lived asset impairments in 2014 in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment as part of Project Orion.\nCritical Estimate-Asset Impairment\nThe determination of a long-lived asset impairment involves significant judgments based upon short-term and long-term projections of future asset performance. If the undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset (or asset group) do not exceed the asset's book value, impairment loss estimates would be based upon the difference between the book value and fair value of the asset. The fair value is generally based upon the Company's estimate of the amount that the assets could be bought or sold for in a transaction between willing parties. If quoted market prices for the asset or similar assets are unavailable, the fair value estimate is generally calculated using a DCF model. Should circumstances change that affect these estimates, additional impairment charges may be required and would be recorded through income in the period the change was determined.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating long-lived asset impairments for the years presented. U.S. GAAP requires consideration of all valuation techniques for which market participant inputs can be obtained without undue cost and effort. The use of a DCF model continues to be an appropriate method for determining fair value; however, methodologies such as quoted market prices must also be evaluated. See Note 17, Other Expenses, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory balances are adjusted for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, inventories of $187.7 million and $217.0 million, respectively, are net of lower of cost or market reserves and obsolescence reserves of $10.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively.\nCertain contracts within the Harsco Rail Segment, which meet specific criteria established in U.S. GAAP, are accounted for as long-term contracts. Inventories related to these contracts are considered Contracts-in-process and represent a separate component of Inventories. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Contracts-in-process of $54.0 million and $55.8 million, respectively, were included in Inventories. Contracts-in-process at December 31, 2016 were net of estimated forward loss-provisions related to these contacts of $36.2 million. No estimated forward loss provision was made at December 31, 2015.\nCritical Estimate-Inventories\nIn assessing the realization of inventory balances, the Company is required to make judgments as to future demand and compare these with current or committed inventory levels. If actual market conditions are determined to be less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the determination is made. Additionally, the Company records reserves to adjust a substantial portion of its U.S. inventory balances to the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method of inventory valuation. In adjusting these reserves throughout the year, the Company estimates its year-end inventory costs and quantities. At December 31 of each year, the reserves are adjusted to reflect actual year-end inventory costs and quantities. During periods of inflation, LIFO expense usually increases and during periods of deflation it decreases. These year-end adjustments resulted in pre-tax income of $1.2 million in 2016, pre-tax expense of $0.1 million in 2015 and pre-tax expense of $1.4 million in 2014.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating inventory reserves for the years presented. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition - Long-term Contracts\nCertain contracts within the Harsco Rail Segment, which meet specific criteria established in U.S. GAAP, are accounted for as long-term contracts, under the percentage-of-completion (units-of-delivery) method of accounting.\nCritical Estimate-Revenue Recognition - Long-term Contracts\nAccounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs (including estimating any liquidating damages or penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical items. Due to the number of years it may take to complete these contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, estimating total sales and costs at completion is inherently complicated and subject to many variables. Accordingly, estimates are subject to change as experience is gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of the work under the contract may not have changed. When adjustments in estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract using the percentage-of-completion method exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nDuring 2016, as a result of increased vendor costs, ongoing discussions with SBB, and increased estimates for commissioning, certification and testing costs, as well as expected settlements with SBB, the Company concluded it will have a loss on the contracts with SBB. The Company recognized an estimated forward loss provision related to the SBB contracts of\n$45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 in Costs of products sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was no estimated forward loss provision at December 31, 2015 or 2014. The estimated forward loss provision represents the Company's best estimate based on currently available information. It is possible that the Company's overall estimate of costs to complete these contracts may change which would result in an adjustment to the estimated forward loss provision at such time, but the Company is unable to estimate any further possible loss or range of loss at December 31, 2016.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company retains a significant portion of the risk for U.S. workers' compensation, U.K. employers' liability, automobile, general and product liability losses. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded liabilities of $37.1 million and $41.8 million, respectively, related to both asserted and unasserted insurance claims. At December 31, 2016 and 2015,\n$3.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, was included in insurance liabilities related to claims covered by insurance carriers for which a corresponding receivable has been recorded.\nCritical Estimate-Insurance Reserves\nInsurance reserves have been recorded based upon actuarial calculations that reflect the undiscounted estimated liabilities for ultimate losses, including claims incurred but not reported. Inherent in these estimates are assumptions that are based on the Company's history of claims and losses, a detailed analysis of existing claims with respect to potential value, and current legal and legislative trends. If actual claims differ from those projected by management, changes (either increases or decreases) to insurance reserves may be required and would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the change was determined. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a retrospective insurance reserve adjustment that decreased pre-tax insurance expense from continuing operations for self-insured programs by $5.4 million,\n$8.5 million and $7.0 million, respectively. The Company has programs in place to improve claims experience, such as disciplined claim and insurance litigation management and a focused approach to workplace safety.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating insurance reserves for the years presented. There are currently no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur that would materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best estimate of taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to various international, federal, state and local income taxes in jurisdictions where the Company operates. In determining income tax expense, the Company makes its best estimate of the annual effective income tax rate at the end of each quarter and applies that rate to year-to-date income (loss) before income taxes to arrive at the year-to-date income tax provision (exclusive of loss jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is realizable with any discrete tax items recorded separately). At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's annual effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was (8.4)%, 79.5% and 214.8%, respectively.\nCritical Estimate-Income Taxes\nAnnual effective income tax rates are estimated by giving recognition to currently enacted tax rates, tax holidays, tax credits, capital losses, and tax deductions as well as certain exempt income and non-deductible expenses for all jurisdictions where the Company operates. Quarterly income tax provisions incorporate any change in the year-to-date provision from the previous quarterly periods.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determinations, the Company considers all available evidence, including future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, feasible and prudent tax planning strategies and recent financial operating results. In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made that would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nValuation allowances of $146.1 million and $110.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related principally to deferred tax assets for U.K. pension liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, capital losses, currency translation and foreign investment tax credits that are uncertain as to realizability. In 2016, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of\n$16.1 million related to loss on sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand, $13.5 million related to estimated forward loss provisions related to the SBB contracts, and current year pension adjustments of $19.2 million recorded through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. This was partially offset by the reduction from the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments and the decrease related to U.K. and France tax rate changes. In 2015, the Company recorded a net decrease in the valuation allowance of $16.1 million related to current year pension adjustments recorded through Accumulated other comprehensive loss, the current year decrease from the currency translation in the amount of $11.5 million, and\n$6.3 million decrease related to a U.K. tax rate change. This was offset by a net increase of $13.2 million related to losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on its technical merits. The unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively, excluding accrued interest and penalties. The unrecognized tax benefit may decrease as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations or as a result of final settlement and resolution of outstanding tax matters in various state and international jurisdictions.\nThe Company has not provided U.S. income taxes on certain non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings, as such amounts are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The Company evaluates future financial projections for its most significant subsidiaries, the need to reinvest earnings locally and the overall cash requirements of the Company. Based upon this evaluation, the Company determined that certain undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. The Company believes that it can generate sufficient cash flows to avoid the one-time tax costs associated with repatriation of undistributed earnings to the U.S. from prior periods. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, such earnings were approximately $528 million and $547 million, respectively. It is not practical to determine the deferred income tax liability on these earnings if, in the future, they are remitted to the U.S. because the income tax liability to be incurred, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions for the years presented or for quarterly periods. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nResearch and Development\nInternal funding for research and development was as follows:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Research and Development Expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Metals & Minerals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Harsco Rail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Research and Development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amounts shown exclude technology development and engineering costs classified in cost of services sold; cost of products sold; or selling, general and administrative expenses.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nInformation on recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards is included in Note 2, Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nDividend Action\nThe Board normally reviews the dividend policy and the dividend rate on a quarterly basis.\nThe Company paid one cash dividend of $0.05125 per share in 2016. This dividend was paid on February 16, 2016.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Harsco Corporation (the \"Company\") provided under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmounts included in this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are rounded in millions and all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts. As a result, minor differences may exist due to rounding.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe nature of the Company's business and the many countries in which it operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In accordance with the \"safe harbor\" provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company provides the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward-looking statements, including the expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Forward-looking statements contained herein could include, among other things, statements about management's confidence in and strategies for performance; expectations for new and existing products, technologies and opportunities; and expectations regarding growth, sales, cash flows, and earnings. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of such terms as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"likely,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan\" or other comparable terms.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in the worldwide business environment in which the Company operates, including general economic conditions; (2) changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity and fuel costs and capital costs;(3) changes in the performance of equity and bond markets that could affect, among other things, the valuation of the assets in the Company's pension plans and the accounting for pension assets, liabilities and expenses; (4) changes in governmental laws and regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety, tax and import tariff standards; (5) market and competitive changes, including pricing pressures, market demand and acceptance for new products, services and technologies; (6) the Company's inability or failure to protect its intellectual property rights from infringement in one or more of the many countries in which the Company operates; (7) failure to effectively prevent, detect or recover from breaches in the Company's cybersecurity infrastructure; (8) unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of the many countries in which the Company operates due to political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities, public health issues or other calamities; (9) disruptions associated with labor disputes and increased operating costs associated with union organization; (10) the seasonal nature of the Company's business; (11) the Company's ability to successfully enter into new contracts and complete new acquisitions or strategic ventures in the time-frame contemplated, or at all; (12) the integration of the Company's strategic acquisitions; (13) the amount and timing of repurchases of the Company's common stock, if any; (14) the prolonged recovery in global financial and credit markets and economic conditions generally, which could result in the Company's customers curtailing development projects, construction, production and capital expenditures, which, in turn, could reduce the demand for the Company's products and services and, accordingly, the Company's revenues, margins and profitability; (15) the outcome of any disputes with customers, contractors and subcontractors; (16) the financial condition of the Company's customers, including the ability of customers (especially those that may be highly leveraged and those with inadequate liquidity) to maintain their credit availability; (17) the Company's ability to successfully implement and receive the expected benefits of cost-reduction and restructuring initiatives, including the achievement of expected cost savings in the expected time frame; (18) implementation of environmental remediation matters; (19) risk and uncertainty associated with intangible assets; (20) the impact of a transaction, if any, resulting from the Company's determination to explore strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; and (21) other risk factors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. A further discussion of these, along with other potential risk factors, can be found in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company cautions that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. The Company undertakes no duty to update forward-looking statements except as may be required by law.\nExecutive Overview\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a new senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d), consisting of a $400 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $550 million term loan B facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\"). Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the 5.75% Senior Notes due 2018 (the Notes\u201d) in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Financing Agreements and the Notes. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nIn September 2016, the Company sold its remaining approximate 26% equity interest in Brand Energy & Infrastructure Services (\"Brand\"). In exchange for the Company's interest, (i) the Company received $145 million in cash, net, and (ii) the requirement for the Company to fund certain obligations to Brand through 2018 were satisfied, the present value of which equaled $20.6 million. As a result of the sale, the Company's obligation to make quarterly payments related to the unit adjustment liability under the terms of a limited partnership agreement that governed the operation of the strategic venture terminated. The Company recognized a loss on the sale of its equity interest in Brand in the amount of $43.5 million, which was recognized in Change in fair value to unit adjustment liability and loss on dilution and sale of equity method investment on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nAlthough steel markets have demonstrated some improvement, the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment continued to be negatively impacted by lower customer steel production, weak commodity prices and site exits during 2016. These impacts have been offset by the savings and benefits achieved as part of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment's Improvement Plan (\"Project Orion\") including lower compensation costs and the impact of exited underperforming contracts. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Project Orion was expanded with additional targeted workforce and operational savings of $20 million to $25 million. The majority of these benefits were realized during 2016. See Note 19, Restructuring Programs, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. Also, results for 2015 included costs incurred by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment related to a steel mill customer liquidation, salt cake disposal costs and charges associated with a subcontractor settlement which decreased operating income by $24.9 million. The Company remains focused on achieving additional cost reductions and operational improvements to enhance returns for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nThe Harsco Rail Segment recorded estimated forward loss provision of $45.1 million during 2016 related to the Company's contracts with the federal railway system of Switzerland (\"SBB\"). The estimated forward loss provision resulted from increased vendor costs, ongoing discussions with SBB, and increased estimates for commissioning, certification and testing costs, as well as expected settlements with SBB. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. Also, results for 2015 included a $10.9 million foreign exchange gain that was not repeated in 2016. Additionally, the Harsco Rail Segment continues to be impacted by continued weakness in the North American market.\nWhile energy markets have demonstrated some fundamental improvement, the Harsco Industrial Segment's air-cooled heat exchangers and industrial grating businesses will lag the market given the lead time for capital expenditures to formalize into new projects for customers in the upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas markets served by the Company to be constrained. Accordingly, these factors are expected to impact revenue and operating income during the first half of 2017 in the Harsco Industrial Segment.\nThe Company has announced its intention to pursue strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment from the rest of the Company. A separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment would allow each of the Company's businesses to benefit from dedicated capital structures; execute tailored and flexible strategic priorities; and optimize capital return policies consistent with each business's unique priorities. There is no specific timetable related to this initiative and there can be no assurance that a sale, spin-off or any other transaction will take place. The Company incurred $3.3 million and $9.9 million of expenses during 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the separation, which are included as part of Corporate in the Company's segment results.\nRevenues by Segment\n\nRevenues by Region\n\n (a) Includes Mexico.  Revenues for the Company totaled $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change is primarily related to the impact of price and volume changes across all segments; exited contracts in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; and the impacts of foreign currency translation. Foreign currency translation decreased revenues by $51.0 million for 2016 in comparison with the prior year.\nOperating Income and Operating Margins by Segment\n\n\n (b) Corporate includes $3.3 million and $9.9 million of expenses related to the potential Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment separation for twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nOperating income from continuing operations for 2016 was $63.5 million compared with operating income from continuing operations of $88.5 million in 2015. Foreign currency translation increased Operating income by $3.4 million for 2016 in comparison to prior year. Refer to the segment discussions below for information pertaining to factors positively affecting and negatively impacting operating income.\nHarsco Metals & Minerals Segment:\n\nFactors Positively Affecting Operating Income:\n \u2022 Incremental Project Orion restructuring benefits related to compensation savings of approximately $15 million during 2016, associated with the last phase of Project Orion. \n \u2022 The effect of new contracts, exited underperforming contracts and lower maintenance, fuel and pension costs. \n \u2022 Increased volumes in the roofing granules and industrial abrasives business, due partly to favorable weather conditions during 2016. \n \u2022 Costs incurred by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment related to a steel mill customer liquidation, salt cake disposal costs, charges associated with a subcontractor settlement and additional site exit costs. These items decreased operating income by $30.8 million during 2015 and did not repeat in 2016. \n \u2022 Foreign currency translation in 2016 positively affected operating income for this segment compared with the prior year. \nFactors Negatively Impacting Operating Income:\n \u2022 Decreased global steel production. Overall, steel production by customers under services contracts, including the impact of exited contracts, decreased by 10% for 2016 compared with the prior year. Excluding the impact of exited contracts, steel production by customers under services contracts decreased by 2% for 2016 compared with the prior year. \n \u2022 Decreased income attributable to the impact of lost contracts and reduced nickel prices and demand. Nickel prices decreased 20% during 2016 compared with the prior year. \n \u2022 Severance costs resulting from a probable site exit decreased operating income by $5.1 million during 2016. \nHarsco Industrial Segment:\n\nFactors Positively Affecting Operating Income:\n \u2022 Operating income was aided by $9.1 million of lower selling, general and administrative costs in 2016 compared with the prior year. \n \u2022 The effect of delivering the Mexico City International Airport security fencing order in 2016. \nFactors Negatively Impacting Operating Income:\n \u2022 Lower overall volumes in the air-cooled heat exchangers business, resulting in decreased operating income during 2016. These lower volumes are primarily attributable to lower energy prices which impacted capital spending by customers in the oil and natural gas industries served by the Company. \n \u2022 Lower volumes and higher material costs in the industrial grating products business. \n \u2022 2015 included gains from sales of assets of $3.6 million which did not repeat during 2016. \nHarsco Rail Segment:\n\nFactors Positively Affecting Operating Income (Loss):\n \u2022 Increased sales of international equipment, spare parts and safety equipment. \n \u2022 Operating income (loss) was aided by $1.4 million of lower selling, general and administrative costs in 2016 compared with the prior year. \nFactors Negatively Impacting Operating Income (Loss):\n \u2022 During 2016, the Harsco Rail Segment recorded an estimated forward loss provision of $45.1 million related to the Company's contracts with SBB. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. \n \u2022 Foreign currency gain of $10.9 million recognized during 2015 which did not repeat in 2016. \n \u2022 Decreased volumes in North America and a less favorable mix of equipment sales decreased operating income (loss) during 2016 compared with the prior year. \n \u2022 Lower volumes and higher costs for contract services decreased operating income (loss) during 2016 compared with the prior year. \nOutlook, Trends and Strategies\nDespite uncertainties in the global economy, along with the persistent challenges of global steel production and related pricing, as well as low oil prices, the Company believes it is positioned to execute actions through a disciplined focus on return-based capital allocations and business portfolio strategies. The Company believes these actions will enable it to generate returns above its cost of capital with a balanced business portfolio without endangering its financial profile with unreasonable leverage.\nThese business portfolio strategies will continue to focus on improving the performance of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment while pursuing select growth opportunities as global steel markets recover. For the Harsco Rail and Harsco Industrial Segments, the Company will focus on disciplined growth organically, and through acquisitions, that improve these businesses' competitive positions in core or adjacent markets. The Company will continue to pursue cost-reduction and efficiency initiatives, including Continuous Improvement, which have significantly reduced, and are expected to continue to reduce, the Company's cost structure and further enhance its financial strength without diminishing its services and products capabilities. As part of these initiatives, the Company will continue to focus on maintaining an active, lean corporate center that optimizes corporate costs while continuing to develop value added activities to support the Company.\nThe Company's expansion into targeted growth markets; its diversity of services and products in industries that are fundamental to global growth; its long-term mill services and minerals supply contracts; its differentiated technologies and innovations; its return based capital allocations and business portfolio strategies; and its focus on executing cost reduction and efficiency initiatives, help mitigate the Company's overall long-term exposure to changes in the economic outlook in any single economy or industry. However, deterioration of global economies and industries could still have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe following significant items, risks, trends and strategies are expected to affect the Company in 2017 and beyond:\n \u2022 The Company will focus on providing returns above its cost of capital for its stockholders by balancing its portfolio of businesses, and by executing its strategic and operational practices with reasonable amounts of financial leverage. \n \u2022 The Company will continue to build and develop strong core capabilities and maintain an active and lean corporate center that balances costs with value added services. \n \u2022 The Company will assess capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives. Management will be selective and disciplined in allocating capital by rigorously analyzing projects and utilizing a return-based capital allocation process. \n \u2022 The Company expects its operational effective income tax rate to approximate 39% to 41% in 2017. \n \u2022 The potential consequences related to uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's proposed exit from the European Union may have an impact on the Company results of operations, cash flows and asset valuations in any period particularly in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information. \nHarsco Metals & Minerals Segment:\n \u2022 Steel markets demonstrated some pricing improvement during 2016 and the Company expects modest improvements in demand, the effect of new contracts, the continued benefits achieved as part of Project Orion and additional improvement initiatives to positively affect operating income in the near term in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment. These improvements will be partially offset by possible site exits and the anticipated impact of foreign currency translation. \n \u2022 In addition to the benefits and discipline that resulted from Project Orion, the Company will continue to focus on ensuring that forecasted profits and other requirements for contracts meet certain established standards and deliver returns above its cost of capital. In connection with this focus, the possibility exists that the Company may take strategic actions that result in exit costs and non-cash asset impairment charges that may have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and liquidity. \n \u2022 In February 2016, the Company announced a new 15-year contract with China's largest steel maker with anticipated revenues totaling approximately $125 million over the life of the contract. In March 2016, the Company secured a contract extension for steel mill services in Belgium with projected revenues totaling more than $100 million. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company announced expanded services with Chile's largest steelmaker and a new contract in Egypt with projected revenues totaling more than $40 million and $35 million, respectively. In November 2016, the Company announced a multi-year expansion of steel mill services at a North American customer with projected revenues totaling more than $50 million. Additionally, the Company recently announced two multi-year contracts for steel mill services in China and Brazil with projected revenues totaling more than $100 million. \n \u2022 As the Company has previously disclosed, over the past several years the Company has been in discussions with officials at the Supreme Council for Environment in Bahrain (\"Bahrain Council\") with regard to a processing by-product (\"salt cakes\") located at Hafeera. During 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $7.0 million, payable over five to seven years, related to the estimated cost of processing and disposal of the salt cakes. The Company's Bahrain operations are operated under a strategic venture for which its strategic venture partner has a 35% minority interest. The Company is awaiting final approval from the Bahrain Council regarding the proposed processing and disposal method. If the Bahrain Council does not approve the proposed method or mandates alternative solutions, the Company's estimated liability could change, and such change could be material in any one period. \n \u2022 During 2016, one of the Company's customers announced its intention to conduct a strategic review of its steel making operations in Europe, including the possibility of strategic collaborations through a joint venture with another major steel maker. Depending on the outcome of any potential transactions, there could be a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and asset valuations in any one period. \n \u2022 One of the Company's customers in Australia has begun the process of voluntary administration under Australian law, the purpose of which is to focus on long-term solvency. The customer is continuing its operations during the voluntary administration proceedings. The Company had approximately $5 million of receivables with the customer prior to the start of the voluntary administration and continues to believe that these amounts are collectible, because the Company is viewed as an important supplier, continues to provide services to the customer and continues to collect on post-administration invoices timely. However the administration process is uncertain in nature and length. No additional creditors' meeting is scheduled at this time. As such, a loss on the pre-administration receivables is reasonably possible, and if there was a change in the Company's view on collectability, there could be a charge against income in future periods. Moreover, if the site were to close, additional costs may be incurred and asset valuations may be impacted, which may be significant in any one period. \nHarsco Industrial Segment:\n \u2022 While energy markets have demonstrated some fundamental improvement, the Harsco Industrial Segment's air-cooled heat exchangers and industrial grating businesses will lag the market given the lead time for capital expenditures to formalize into new projects for customers in the upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas markets served by the Company to be constrained. Accordingly, these factors are expected to impact revenue and operating income during the first half of 2017 in the Harsco Industrial Segment. \n \u2022 The Company is committed to maintaining recent efficiency gains in the air-cooled heat exchangers and industrial grating products businesses and implementing additional improvements in response to the recent industry and economic challenges. \n \u2022 The Company will continue to focus on product innovation and development to drive strategic growth in its businesses. During 2016, the Company introduced GrateGuardTM, a new fencing solution for first-line physical security in the Industrial grating business. Additionally, the Company recently announced the launch of an all-new capability for remote indoor boiler monitoring that can be downloaded directly to wireless and desktop devices. \n \u2022 The Company will focus on growing the Harsco Industrial Segment through disciplined organic expansion and acquisitions that improve competitive positioning in core markets or adjacent markets. \nHarsco Rail Segment:\n \u2022 The global demand for railway maintenance-of-way equipment, parts and services continues to be generally positive, though the North American market is experiencing weakness due to reduced capital and operating spending by Class I railways. \n \u2022 During April 2016, the Company was awarded a multi-year rail grinding services contract extension in the U.K. with anticipated revenues of at least $38 million. During December 2016, the Company announced new sales of railway track grinders for use in contract rail grinding programs throughout North America. Additionally, during January 2017, the Company announced a new order to equip the entire Denver, Colorado regional railway fleet with enhanced safety systems. \n \u2022 In prior years, the Company secured two contract awards with initial contract values totaling approximately $200 million from SBB. The majority of deliveries under these contracts are anticipated to occur during 2017 through 2020. The Harsco Rail Segment recorded estimated forward loss provisions of $40.1 million and $5.0 million during the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively, which resulted from increased vendor costs, ongoing discussions with SBB, and increased estimates for commissioning, certification and testing costs, as well as expected settlements with SBB. It is possible that the Company's overall estimate of costs to complete these contracts may increase which would result in an additional estimated forward loss provision at such time. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. \n \u2022 The Company will focus on growing the Harsco Rail Segment through disciplined organic expansion and acquisitions that improve competitive positioning in core markets or adjacent markets. \nResults of Operations\n\nComparative Analysis of Consolidated Results\nTotal Revenues\nRevenues for 2016 decreased $271.9 million or 16% from 2015. This decrease was attributable to the following significant items:\n\nRevenues for 2015 decreased $343.2 million or 17% from 2014. This decrease was attributable to the following significant items:\n\nCost of Services and Products Sold\nCost of services and products sold for 2016 decreased $185.9 million or 14% from 2015. This decrease was attributable to the following significant items:\n\n (a) See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. \nCost of services and products sold for 2015 decreased $287.5 million or 17% from 2014. This decrease was attributable to the following significant items:\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 decreased $41.7 million or 17% from 2015. This decrease was primarily related to the impact of reduced bad debt expense in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; decreased agent and broker commissions in the Harsco Industrial Segment due to lower volume; and foreign currency translation. Additionally, results for 2016 were also impacted by lower pension expense, professional fees and compensation costs associated with Project Orion in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment and travel costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 decreased $42.6 million or 15% from 2014. This decrease was primarily related to the impact of lower compensation costs associated with Project Orion in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, foreign currency translation, lower professional fees, and decreased agent and broker commissions in the Harsco Rail and Industrial Segments, partially offset by increased bad debt expense due principally to a Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment's steel mill customer liquidation.\nLoss on Disposal of the Harsco Infrastructure Segment and Transaction Costs\nThe Company recorded a loss on disposal of the Harsco Infrastructure Segment and related transaction costs of $1.0 million and $5.1 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nOther Expenses\nThis income statement classification includes: certain foreign currency gains, net gains on disposal of non-core assets, employee termination benefit costs and costs to exit activities. Additional information on Other expenses is included in Note 17, Other Expenses, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax Other expenses of $12.6 million, $30.6 million and $57.8 million, respectively. The major components of this income statement caption are as follows:\n\nInterest Expense\n2016 vs. 2015\nInterest expense in 2016 was $51.6 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 10% compared with 2015. The increase primarily relates to $1.1 million of deferred financing costs expensed by the Company during the third quarter of 2016 related to payments for the Term Loan Facility and increased interest rates associated with the Company's borrowings, as well as other financing costs partially offset by lower debt levels. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\n2015 vs. 2014\nInterest expense in 2015 was $46.8 million, a decrease of $0.3 million or 1% compared with 2014. There were no individually significant items related to the change in this Statement of Operations caption.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a New Credit Facility, consisting of a $400 million revolving credit facility and a $550 million term loan B facility. Upon closing of the New Credit Facility, the Company has amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing Term Loan Facility and has redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nChange in Fair Value to the Unit Adjustment Liability and Loss on Dilution and Sale of Equity Method Investment\nThe Change in fair value to the unit adjustment liability and loss on dilution and sale of equity method investment during 2016 increased $50.0 million compared with 2015. The increase relates to the loss associated with Company's first quarter of 2016 election not to make the quarterly cash payments to the Company's partner in the Infrastructure strategic venture for the remainder of 2016 and the Company's third quarter of 2016 sale of its remaining equity interest in the Infrastructure strategic venture. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments and Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nIncome Tax Expense from Continuing Operations\n2016 vs. 2015\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations in 2016 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $21.0 million compared with 2015. The effective income tax rate relating to continued operations for 2016 was (8.4)% versus 79.5% for 2015. The decrease in income tax expense and the change in the effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was primarily due to the change in the mix in earnings between international jurisdictions and the non-recurring loss on early extinguishment of debt. Additionally, there was no income tax benefit realized from the loss on the sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand, as a valuation allowance of $16.1 million was established to offset the deferred tax assets on the resulting capital loss carryforward. There was also no income tax benefit realized from the estimated forward loss provisions related to the SBB contracts, as a valuation allowance of $13.5 million was established to offset the deferred tax assets on the resulting loss carryforward, because the Company determined that it is not more likely than not that these benefits will be realized in the future.\n2015 vs. 2014\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations in 2015 was $27.7 million, a decrease of $2.7 million compared with 2014 and the effective income tax rate relating to continued operations for 2015 was 79.5% versus 214.8% for 2014. The decrease in income tax expense and the change in the effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was primarily due to a reduction in restructuring and asset impairment charges in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment for which no tax benefit was recorded.\nSee Note 11, Income Taxes, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nTotal Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n2016 vs. 2015\nTotal other comprehensive loss was $93.6 million in 2016, compared with total other comprehensive income of $13.9 million in 2015. The major drivers for this change were pension liability adjustments and foreign currency translation adjustments. The pension liability adjustments were the result of lower global weighted average discount rates, principally for the U.K. plan, which decreased from 3.9% to 3.1% during the year. This was partially offset by actual returns on plan assets that were higher than expected returns. Foreign currency translation adjustments were negatively impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n2015 vs. 2014\nTotal other comprehensive income was $13.9 million in 2015, compared with total other comprehensive loss of $163.2 million in 2014. The major drivers for this change were pension liability adjustments, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments. The pension liability adjustments were the result of higher global weighted average discount rates that increased from 3.7% to 3.9% during the year, partially offset by actual returns on plan assets that were less than the expected returns. Foreign currency translation adjustments were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of a $400 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $550 million Term Loan Facility. Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes. As a result, a charge of $35.3 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting principally of the cost of early extinguishment of the Notes and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's existing Financing Agreements and the Notes, and is reflected in the financing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a reduction of long-term debt.\nThe Company has sufficient financial liquidity and borrowing capacity to support the strategies within each of our businesses. The Company currently expects operational and business needs to be met by cash provided by operations supplemented with borrowings from time to time due to historical patterns of seasonal cash flow and for the funding of various projects. The Company continues to assess its capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives.\nThe Company continues to implement and perform capital efficiency initiatives to enhance liquidity and working capital efficiency. These initiatives have included: prudent allocation of capital spending to those projects where the highest results can be achieved; optimization of worldwide cash positions; reductions in discretionary spending; frequent evaluation of customer and business-partner credit risk; and Continuous Improvement initiatives aimed at improving the effective and efficient use of working capital, particularly in accounts receivable and inventories.\nDuring 2016, the Company generated $159.8 million in operating cash flow, an increase from the $121.5 million generated in 2015.\nIn 2016, the Company invested $69.3 million in capital expenditures, mostly for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, compared with $123.6 million in 2015. The Company generated $9.3 million in cash flow from asset sales in 2016 compared with $26.0 million in 2015. Asset sales have been a normal part of the Company's business model, primarily for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nIn September 2016, the Company received approximately $145 million in cash, net, from the sale of its remaining 26% equity interest in Brand. In 2016, the Company received proceeds from the termination of cross-currency interest rate swaps (\"CCIRs\") of $16.6 million compared with $75.1 million in 2015. The Company paid $4.1 million and $65.7 million in dividends to stockholders in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has suspended the quarterly dividend to preserve financial flexibility. The Board of Directors (the \"Board\") will continue to evaluate the Company's dividend policy each quarter.\nThe Company's net cash borrowings decreased by $261.2 million in 2016 principally due to the utilization of operating cash flows, proceeds from the termination of CCIRs and proceeds from the sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand. The Company's consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") ratio, as defined by the Credit Agreement, was 2.3 to 1.0 at December 31, 2016.\nCash Requirements\nThe following summarizes the Company's expected future payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2016:\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments at December 31, 2016 (a)\n\n (a) See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements; Note 9, Operating Leases; Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans; Note 11, Income Taxes; and Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information on short-term borrowings and long-term debt (including capital leases); operating leases; employee benefit plans; income taxes; CCIRs and foreign currency exchange forward contracts, respectively. \n (b) The total projected interest payments on long-term debt are based upon borrowings, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2016. The interest rates on variable-rate debt and the foreign currency exchange rates are subject to changes beyond the Company's control and may result in actual interest expense and payments differing from the amounts projected above. \n (c) Amounts represent expected employer contributions to defined benefit pension plans for the next year. \n (d) Purchase obligations represent legally binding obligations to purchase property, plant and equipment, inventory and other commitments made in the normal course of business to meet operations requirements. \n (e) Due to the nature of these CCIRs, based on December 31, 2016 fair values there would be net cash received of $0.4 million comprised of cash payments of $2.3 million and cash receipts of $2.7 million. Accordingly, no amounts are included in the above table. The CCIRs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. \n (f) Amounts represent the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2016. Due to the nature of these contracts, based on fair values at December 31, 2016 there will be net cash received of $1.4 million comprised of cash payments of $600.9 million and cash receipts of $602.3 million. Accordingly, no amounts are included in the above table. The foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance sheets at fair value. \n (g) At December 31, 2016, in addition to the above contractual obligations, the Company had $5.7 million of potential long-term tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these potential long-term tax liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contingent commercial commitments at December 31, 2016. These amounts are not included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since there are no current circumstances known to management indicating that the Company will be required to make payments on these contingent commercial commitments.\nCommercial Commitments at December 31, 2016\n\nCertain commercial commitments that are of a continuous nature do not have an expiration date and are therefore considered to be indefinite in nature. See Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under its Senior Secured Credit Facility, augmented by cash proceeds from asset sales. The primary drivers of the Company's cash flow from operations are the Company's revenues and income. Cash returns on capital investments made in the prior years, for which limited cash is currently required, are a significant source of cash provided by operations. Depreciation expense related to these investments is a non-cash charge.\nThe Company plans to redeploy discretionary cash for potential growth opportunities, such as disciplined organic growth and higher-return service contracts opportunities for the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, and strategic investments or possible acquisitions in the Harsco Rail and Harsco Industrial Segments that improve competitive positioning in core markets or adjacent markets.\nResources Available for Cash Requirements for Operational and Growth Initiatives\nIn addition to utilizing cash provided by operations and cash proceeds from asset sales, the Company has bank credit facilities available throughout the world. The Company also utilizes capital leases to finance the acquisition of certain equipment when appropriate, which allows the Company to minimize capital expenditures. The Company expects to continue to utilize all these sources to meet future cash requirements for operations and growth initiatives.\nOn December 2, 2015, the Company entered into (i) an amendment and restatement agreement and (ii) a second amended and restated credit agreement (together, the Financing Agreements\u201d). The Financing Agreements increased the Company's overall borrowing capacity from $500 million to $600 million by (i) amending and restating the Company's then existing credit agreement, (ii) establishing a term loan A facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $250 million, by converting a portion of the outstanding balance under the then existing credit agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis and (iii) reducing the Revolving Credit Facility limit to $350 million.\nDuring September 2016, the Company received approximately $145 million in cash, net, from its sale of its remaining 26% equity interest in the Infrastructure strategic venture. The Company used these proceeds to repay $85.0 million on the term loan A facility and $60.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. Related to the repayment of the term loan A facility, the Company expensed $1.1 million of previously deferred financing costs.\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Upon closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company amended and extended the existing Revolving Credit Facility, repaid the existing term loan A facility and redeemed, satisfied and discharged the Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 87.5 to 200 basis points over the base rate or 187.5 to 300 basis points over the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility (the \"Credit Agreement\"). Any principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility is due and payable on the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on November 2, 2021.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 375 to 400 basis points over the base rate or 475 to 500 basis points over the adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to a 1% floor, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments, beginning in March 2017, each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the loans under the Term Loan Facility. These payments are reduced by the application of any prepayments, and any remaining balance is due and payable on the maturity of the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility matures on November 2, 2023.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility imposes certain restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions as to types and amounts of debt and liens that may be incurred by the Company; limitations on increases in dividend payments and limitations on certain acquisitions by the Company.\nThe obligations of the Company are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries ( Guarantors\u201d). All obligations under the Senior Credit Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Guarantors.\nIn January 2017, the Company entered into a series of fixed-floating interest rate swaps that cover the period from 2018 through 2021, and had the effect of converting $300 million of the Term Loan Facility from floating-rate to fixed-rate. The fixed rates provided by the swaps replace the adjusted LIBOR rate in the interest calculation, range from 1.65% for 2018 to 2.71% for 2021.\nThe following table illustrates available credit at December 31, 2016: \nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had $648.0 million of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility consisting of $550.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and $98.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, of this balance, $642.5 million was classified as long-term debt and $5.5 million was classified as current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $415.0 million of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisting of $250.0 million under the term loan A facility and $165.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2015, of this balance, $380.5 million was classified as long-term debt,\n$22.0 million was classified as short-term borrowings and $12.5 million was classified as current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information on the Company's Credit Agreement.\nWorking Capital Position\nChanges in the Company's working capital are reflected in the following table:\n\n (h) Calculated as Current assets / Current liabilities  Working capital decreased $8.7 million or 5.5% in 2016 due primarily to the following factors:\n \u2022 Working capital was negatively impacted by a decrease in Inventory of $29.3 million, primarily due to the estimated forward loss provisions related to the Company's Harsco Rail Segment's contracts with SBB which is recorded as a reduction of Contracts-in-process, a component of Inventory, as well as the timing of inventory purchases in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; \n \u2022 Working capital was negatively impacted by a decrease in Other current assets of $22.0 million, primarily due to the timing of current deferred tax assets and prepaid expenses; \n \u2022 Working capital was negatively impacted by a decrease in Trade accounts receivable, net, of $18.3 million, primarily due to timing of invoicing and collections in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, foreign currency translation and decreased sales in the Harsco Industrial Segment; and \n \u2022 Working capital was negatively impacted by an increase in Advances on contracts and other customer advances of $10.1 million, primarily received in the Harsco Rail Segment. \nThese working capital decreases were partially offset by the following factors:\n \u2022 Working capital was positively affected by a decrease in Accounts payable of $28.1 million, primarily due to the timing of payments; \n \u2022 Working capital was positively affected by a decrease in Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt of $25.5 million, primarily due to the expected timing of debt payments; \n \u2022 Working capital was positively affected by a decrease in the Unit adjustment liability of $22.3 million due to the sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments and Note 15, Financial Instruments, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information; and \n \u2022 Working capital was positively affected by a decrease in Other current liabilities of $12.3 million, primarily due to lower accrued commissions, lower accrued interest and the timing of other accruals. \nCertainty of Cash Flows\nThe certainty of the Company's future cash flows is underpinned by the long-term nature of the Company's metals services contracts, the order backlog for the Company's railway track maintenance services and equipment, and overall discretionary cash flows (operating cash flows plus cash from asset sales in excess of the amounts necessary for capital expenditures to maintain current revenue levels) generated by the Company. Historically, the Company has utilized these discretionary cash flows for growth-related capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment and dividend payments.\nThe types of products and services that the Company provides are not subject to rapid technological change, which increases the stability of related cash flows. Additionally, the Company believes each business in its portfolio is a leader in the industries and major markets the Company serves. Due to these factors, the Company is confident in the Company's future ability to generate positive cash flows from operations.\nThe Company has historically generated the majority of its cash flows in the second half of the year. Additionally, the Company's cash flows have been negatively impacted in the near term by reduced steel production, weaker commodity prices and demand, the impact of site exits in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment and low oil prices impacting capital expenditures and overall spending by customers in the natural gas, natural gas processing and petrochemical industries.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:\n\nCash provided by operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $159.8 million, an increase of $38.3 million from 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to timing in inventory purchases, increases in accrued compensation and increases on advances on contracts; partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable invoicing and collections and the timing of accounts payables. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was $121.5 million, a decrease of $105.2 million from 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower customer advances, and an increase in inventory primarily related to the SBB contracts in the Harsco Rail Segment, partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable invoicing and collections.\nIncluded in the Cash flows from operating activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is the caption, Other, net. In 2015, this caption included the Harsco Rail Segment foreign exchange gain which is reflected in the Effect of exchange rate changes on cash. In 2014, this caption consisted of principally the impact of non-cash impaired asset write-downs related to the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nAlso included in the Cash flows from operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is the caption, Other assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the decreases in this caption were\n$12.8 million, $6.0 million and $17.1 million, respectively. A summary of the major components of this caption for the periods presented is as follows: \n (i) Other relates primarily to other accruals that are individually not significant. \nCash provided (used) by investing activities - Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was $122.9 million, an increase of $253.3 million from 2015. The increase is primarily due to the gross proceeds received from the sale of the Company's remaining 26% equity interest in Brand; a lower level of capital expenditures in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, no payments for the unit adjustment liability; and an increase related to foreign currency hedge settlements reported as Other investing activities. In 2015, net cash used by investing activities was $130.4 million, a decrease of\n$99.2 million from 2014. The net decrease was primarily due to a lower level of capital expenditures, primarily in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; a net decrease in purchases of businesses which consisted of Protran and JK Rail in the Harsco Rail Segment in 2015 and Hammco in the Harsco Industrial Segment in 2014; and an increase in proceeds from sales of assets, partially offset by the final working capital adjustment related to the Infrastructure Transaction which was received in 2014. Capital investments decreased $85.3 million compared with 2014.\nCash provided (used) by financing activities - Net cash used by financing activities in 2016 was $292.3 million, an increase of $314.7 million from 2015. The change was primarily due to net cash payments on debt of $261.2 million in 2016 compared with $47.3 million in 2015; reduction in proceeds from the termination of CCIRs and a deferred pension underfunding payment related to the Company's equity interest in Brand; partially offset by lower dividends paid and no repurchases of the Company's common stock in 2016. In 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.5 million, an increase of $44.2 million from 2014. The change was primarily due to proceeds of $75.1 million from the termination of a CCIR, partially offset by an increase in the treasury shares purchased under the Company's share repurchase program then in effect and a decrease in year-over-year net cash borrowings.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Credit Agreement contains a consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant, which is not to exceed 4.0 to 1.0, and a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges ratio covenant, which is not to be less than 3.0 to 1.0. The consolidated net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant is reduced to 3.75 to1.0 after December 31, 2016 and to 3.5 to 1.0 after December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with these covenants as the net leverage ratio was 2.3 to 1.0 and interest coverage ratio was 5.1 to 1.0. Based on balances and covenants in effect at December 31, 2016, the Company could increase net debt by $447.6 million (although the Company only has $258.5 million available credit remaining under the Revolving Credit Facility), and still be in compliance with these debt covenants. Alternatively, keeping all other factors constant, the Company's adjusted EBITDA could decrease by $109.1 million and the Company would still be within these debt covenants. The Company expects to continue to be in compliance with these debt covenants for at least the next twelve months.\nCash Management\nThe Company has various cash management systems throughout the world that centralize cash in various bank accounts where it is economically justifiable and legally permissible to do so. These centralized cash balances are then redeployed to other operations to reduce short-term borrowings and to finance working capital needs or capital expenditures. Due to the transitory nature of cash balances, they are normally invested in bank deposits that can be withdrawn at will or in very liquid short-term bank time deposits and government obligations. The Company's policy is to use the largest banks in the various countries in which the Company operates. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of banks and when appropriate will adjust banking operations to reduce or eliminate exposure to less credit-worthy banks. The Company plans to continue the strategy of targeted, prudent investing for strategic purposes for the foreseeable future and to make more efficient use of existing investments.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents included $70.5 million held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, less than 10% of the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents had regulatory restrictions that would preclude the transfer of funds with and among subsidiaries. The cash and cash equivalents held by non-U.S. subsidiaries also included $26.7 million held in consolidated strategic ventures. The strategic venture agreements may require strategic venture partner approval to transfer funds with and among subsidiaries. While the Company's remaining non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents can be transferred with and among subsidiaries, the majority of these non-U.S. cash balances will be used to support the ongoing working capital needs and continued growth of the Company's non-U.S. operations.\nThe Company's financial position and debt capacity should enable it to meet current and future requirements. The Company continues to assess its capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates, including those related to defined benefit pension benefits, notes and accounts receivable, goodwill, long-lived asset impairment, inventories, revenue recognition - long-term contracts, insurance reserves and income taxes. The impact of changes in these estimates, as necessary, is reflected in the respective segment's results of operations in the period of the change. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different outcomes, assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by the Company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the Audit Committee of the Board and they have reviewed the Company's disclosures relating to these estimates in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These items should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nDefined Benefit Pension Benefits\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans in several countries. The largest of these plans are in the U.K. and the U.S. The Company's funding policy for these plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding pursuant to U.K. and U.S. statutory requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate.\nChanges in the discount rate assumption and the actual performance of plan assets compared with the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are the primary drivers in the change in funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. These factors are components of actuarial loss (gain) and impact the amount recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss), as such actuarial changes are not reflected directly on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but amortized over time in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCritical Estimate-Defined Benefit Pension Benefits\nAccounting for defined benefit pension plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions. The principal assumptions used include the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Each assumption is reviewed annually and represents management's best estimate at that time. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time, and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of unfunded benefit obligation and the expense recognized.\nThe discount rates used in calculating the Company's projected benefit obligations at the December 31, 2016 measurement date for the U.K. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans were 2.7% and 4.0%, respectively, and the global weighted-average discount rate was 3.1%. The discount rates selected represent level-equivalent rates using the yield curve spot rates on a year-by-year expected cash flow basis, using yield curves of high-quality corporate bonds. Annual net periodic pension cost (\"NPPC\") is determined using the discount rates at the beginning of the year. The discount rates for 2016 expense were 3.8% for the U.K. plan, 4.2% for the U.S. plans and 3.9% for the global weighted-average of plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by evaluating the asset return expectations with the Company's advisors as well as actual, long-term, historical results of asset returns for the pension plans. Generally the NPPC increases as the expected long-term rate of return on assets decreases. For 2017 and 2016, the global weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption is 6.2% and 6.7%, respectively. This rate was determined based on a model of expected asset returns for an actively managed portfolio.\nChanges in NPPC may occur in the future due to changes in actuarial assumptions, and due to changes in returns on plan assets resulting from financial market conditions. Holding all other assumptions constant, using December 31, 2016 plan data, a one-quarter percent increase or decrease in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease annual 2016 pre-tax defined benefit NPPC as follows:\nApproximate Changes in Pre-tax Defined Benefit Net Periodic Pension Cost\n\nIncreases or decreases to the net pension obligations may be required should circumstances that affect these estimates change. Additionally, certain events could result in the pension obligation changing at a time other than the annual measurement date. This would occur when a benefit plan is amended or when plan curtailments or settlements occur.\nThe Company has changed the method utilized to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of NPPC for defined benefit pension plans for 2016 and later. The more precise application of discount rates for measuring both service costs and interest costs employs yield curve spot rates on a year-by-year expected cash flow basis, using the same yield curves that the Company has previously used. This change in method represented a change in accounting estimate and has been accounted for in the period of change. This change in method decreased the Company's NPPC by approximately $7 million for 2016, compared to what NPPC would have been under the prior method.\nSee Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nNotes and Accounts Receivable\nNotes and accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value through the use of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. The Company has policies and procedures in place requiring customers to be evaluated for creditworthiness prior to the execution of new service contracts or shipments of products. These reviews are structured to minimize the Company's risk related to realizability of receivables. Despite these policies and procedures, the Company may at times still experience collection problems and potential bad debts due to economic conditions within certain industries (e.g., steel industry), countries or regions in which the Company operates. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, trade accounts receivable of $236.6 million and $254.9 million, respectively, were net of reserves of $11.8 million and $25.6 million, respectively.\nCritical Estimate-Notes and Accounts Receivable\nA considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the realizability of receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer, related aging of past due balances and the facts and circumstances surrounding any non-payment. The Company did not make any significant provisions for bad debts during 2016. The Company's provisions for bad debts during 2015 and 2014 were $13.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively.\nOn a monthly basis, customer accounts are analyzed for collectability. Reserves are established based upon a specific-identification method as well as historical collection experience, as appropriate. The Company also evaluates specific accounts when it becomes aware of a situation in which a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration in financial condition, credit ratings, bankruptcy or receivership. The reserves are based on the facts available to the Company and are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available. Reserves are also determined by using percentages (based upon experience) applied to certain aged receivable categories. Specific issues are discussed with corporate management, and any significant changes in reserve amounts or the write-off of balances must be approved by specifically designated corporate personnel. All approved items are monitored to ensure they are recorded in the proper period. Additionally, any significant changes in reserve balances are reviewed to ensure the proper corporate approval has occurred.\nIf the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Conversely, an improvement in a customer's ability to make payments could result in a decrease of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to both of these situations would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the change was determined. As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a bad debt reserve of\n$2.6 million on receivables with a large steel mill customer who filed for protection under the Marzano Law. During the second quarter of 2014, the customer terminated its contract with the Company under the provisions of the Marzano Law. As a result, during the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded an additional bad debt reserve of $3.9 million on the remaining pre-receivership receivables with this customer. During 2014, the Company recorded a bad debt reserve of $2.6 million for one of its Canadian steel mill customers that filed for receivership protection during the course of the year as the Company has previously disclosed. The amount of the bad debt reserve for this customer represents the full pre-receivership balance. As previously disclosed during 2015, one of the Company's steel mill customers in Europe ceased operations and began a formal process of liquidation in late 2015. The Company had recorded bad debt reserves of approximately $13 million related to this customer during 2015.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating allowances for doubtful accounts for the years presented. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nGoodwill\nThe Company's goodwill balances were $382.3 million and $400.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1. The Company has five reporting units (only three of which have goodwill associated with them as of December 31, 2016). The Company's reporting units with goodwill are the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, the Harsco Rail Segment and the air-cooled heat exchanger business of the Harsco Industrial Segment. Almost all of the Company's goodwill is allocated to the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment.\nCritical Estimate-Goodwill\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to dispose of a business. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include declining cash flows or operating losses at the reporting unit level, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, among others.\nThe evaluation of potential goodwill impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to the net book value, including goodwill. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model ( DCF model\u201d) to estimate the current fair value of reporting units, as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of current fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the preparation of DCF models, including future revenues and operating margin growth, the weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d), tax rates, capital spending, pension funding, the impact of strategic business initiatives, and working capital projections. These assumptions and estimates may vary significantly among reporting units. DCF models are based on approved long-range plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections for later years. WACC rates are derived from internal and external factors including, but not limited to, the average market price of the Company's stock, shares outstanding, book value of the Company's debt, the long-term risk free interest rate, and both market and size-specific risk premiums. Due to the many variables noted above and the relative size of the Company's goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material impact on the results of the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing. If the net book value of a reporting unit were to exceed the current fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would currently be required to determine if an impairment existed and the amount of goodwill impairment to record, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the net book value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if it were to be acquired in a hypothetical business combination, and the current fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. The second step of the goodwill impairment test requires the utilization of valuation experts.\nThe performance of the Company's 2016 annual impairment tests did not result in any impairment of the Company's goodwill.\nFor the Company's 2016 annual goodwill impairment test, the average annual revenue growth rates over the duration of the DCF models ranged from 1.7% to 4.8%. The WACCs used in the 2016 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 9.25% to 10.75%.\nThe Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment reporting unit's fair value at October 1, 2016 was approximately 12% more than the net book value. Significant assumptions utilized in the DCF model include a WACC of 10.75%, an average annual revenue growth rate of 1.7% and average annual cash flow growth rate of 0.6%. Should there be degradation in the overall markets served by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, it may result in an impairment of the Harsco Metal & Minerals Segment goodwill.\nIt is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction, including the Company's announced intention to pursue strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment from the rest of the Company, could differ materially from those used to evaluate the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for additional information.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may be impaired. The amounts charged against pre-tax income from continuing operations related to impaired long-lived assets included in Other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were $0.4 million, $8.2 million and $39.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The decrease in long-lived asset impairments in 2016 was due primarily to a decreased number of site exits in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment upon substantial completion of actions associated with Project Orion. The decrease in long-lived asset impairments in 2015 was due primarily to higher long-lived asset impairments in 2014 in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment as part of Project Orion.\nCritical Estimate-Asset Impairment\nThe determination of a long-lived asset impairment involves significant judgments based upon short-term and long-term projections of future asset performance. If the undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset (or asset group) do not exceed the asset's book value, impairment loss estimates would be based upon the difference between the book value and fair value of the asset. The fair value is generally based upon the Company's estimate of the amount that the assets could be bought or sold for in a transaction between willing parties. If quoted market prices for the asset or similar assets are unavailable, the fair value estimate is generally calculated using a DCF model. Should circumstances change that affect these estimates, additional impairment charges may be required and would be recorded through income in the period the change was determined.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating long-lived asset impairments for the years presented. U.S. GAAP requires consideration of all valuation techniques for which market participant inputs can be obtained without undue cost and effort. The use of a DCF model continues to be an appropriate method for determining fair value; however, methodologies such as quoted market prices must also be evaluated. See Note 17, Other Expenses, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory balances are adjusted for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, inventories of $187.7 million and $217.0 million, respectively, are net of lower of cost or market reserves and obsolescence reserves of $10.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively.\nCertain contracts within the Harsco Rail Segment, which meet specific criteria established in U.S. GAAP, are accounted for as long-term contracts. Inventories related to these contracts are considered Contracts-in-process and represent a separate component of Inventories. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Contracts-in-process of $54.0 million and $55.8 million, respectively, were included in Inventories. Contracts-in-process at December 31, 2016 were net of estimated forward loss-provisions related to these contacts of $36.2 million. No estimated forward loss provision was made at December 31, 2015.\nCritical Estimate-Inventories\nIn assessing the realization of inventory balances, the Company is required to make judgments as to future demand and compare these with current or committed inventory levels. If actual market conditions are determined to be less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the determination is made. Additionally, the Company records reserves to adjust a substantial portion of its U.S. inventory balances to the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method of inventory valuation. In adjusting these reserves throughout the year, the Company estimates its year-end inventory costs and quantities. At December 31 of each year, the reserves are adjusted to reflect actual year-end inventory costs and quantities. During periods of inflation, LIFO expense usually increases and during periods of deflation it decreases. These year-end adjustments resulted in pre-tax income of $1.2 million in 2016, pre-tax expense of $0.1 million in 2015 and pre-tax expense of $1.4 million in 2014.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating inventory reserves for the years presented. See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition - Long-term Contracts\nCertain contracts within the Harsco Rail Segment, which meet specific criteria established in U.S. GAAP, are accounted for as long-term contracts, under the percentage-of-completion (units-of-delivery) method of accounting.\nCritical Estimate-Revenue Recognition - Long-term Contracts\nAccounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs (including estimating any liquidating damages or penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical items. Due to the number of years it may take to complete these contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, estimating total sales and costs at completion is inherently complicated and subject to many variables. Accordingly, estimates are subject to change as experience is gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of the work under the contract may not have changed. When adjustments in estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract using the percentage-of-completion method exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nDuring 2016, as a result of increased vendor costs, ongoing discussions with SBB, and increased estimates for commissioning, certification and testing costs, as well as expected settlements with SBB, the Company concluded it will have a loss on the contracts with SBB. The Company recognized an estimated forward loss provision related to the SBB contracts of\n$45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 in Costs of products sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was no estimated forward loss provision at December 31, 2015 or 2014. The estimated forward loss provision represents the Company's best estimate based on currently available information. It is possible that the Company's overall estimate of costs to complete these contracts may change which would result in an adjustment to the estimated forward loss provision at such time, but the Company is unable to estimate any further possible loss or range of loss at December 31, 2016.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company retains a significant portion of the risk for U.S. workers' compensation, U.K. employers' liability, automobile, general and product liability losses. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded liabilities of $37.1 million and $41.8 million, respectively, related to both asserted and unasserted insurance claims. At December 31, 2016 and 2015,\n$3.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, was included in insurance liabilities related to claims covered by insurance carriers for which a corresponding receivable has been recorded.\nCritical Estimate-Insurance Reserves\nInsurance reserves have been recorded based upon actuarial calculations that reflect the undiscounted estimated liabilities for ultimate losses, including claims incurred but not reported. Inherent in these estimates are assumptions that are based on the Company's history of claims and losses, a detailed analysis of existing claims with respect to potential value, and current legal and legislative trends. If actual claims differ from those projected by management, changes (either increases or decreases) to insurance reserves may be required and would be recorded through Operating income (loss) from continuing operations in the period the change was determined. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a retrospective insurance reserve adjustment that decreased pre-tax insurance expense from continuing operations for self-insured programs by $5.4 million,\n$8.5 million and $7.0 million, respectively. The Company has programs in place to improve claims experience, such as disciplined claim and insurance litigation management and a focused approach to workplace safety.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating insurance reserves for the years presented. There are currently no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur that would materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best estimate of taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to various international, federal, state and local income taxes in jurisdictions where the Company operates. In determining income tax expense, the Company makes its best estimate of the annual effective income tax rate at the end of each quarter and applies that rate to year-to-date income (loss) before income taxes to arrive at the year-to-date income tax provision (exclusive of loss jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is realizable with any discrete tax items recorded separately). At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's annual effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was (8.4)%, 79.5% and 214.8%, respectively.\nCritical Estimate-Income Taxes\nAnnual effective income tax rates are estimated by giving recognition to currently enacted tax rates, tax holidays, tax credits, capital losses, and tax deductions as well as certain exempt income and non-deductible expenses for all jurisdictions where the Company operates. Quarterly income tax provisions incorporate any change in the year-to-date provision from the previous quarterly periods.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determinations, the Company considers all available evidence, including future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, feasible and prudent tax planning strategies and recent financial operating results. In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made that would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nValuation allowances of $146.1 million and $110.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related principally to deferred tax assets for U.K. pension liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, capital losses, currency translation and foreign investment tax credits that are uncertain as to realizability. In 2016, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of\n$16.1 million related to loss on sale of the Company's equity interest in Brand, $13.5 million related to estimated forward loss provisions related to the SBB contracts, and current year pension adjustments of $19.2 million recorded through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. This was partially offset by the reduction from the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments and the decrease related to U.K. and France tax rate changes. In 2015, the Company recorded a net decrease in the valuation allowance of $16.1 million related to current year pension adjustments recorded through Accumulated other comprehensive loss, the current year decrease from the currency translation in the amount of $11.5 million, and\n$6.3 million decrease related to a U.K. tax rate change. This was offset by a net increase of $13.2 million related to losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on its technical merits. The unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively, excluding accrued interest and penalties. The unrecognized tax benefit may decrease as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations or as a result of final settlement and resolution of outstanding tax matters in various state and international jurisdictions.\nThe Company has not provided U.S. income taxes on certain non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistributed earnings, as such amounts are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The Company evaluates future financial projections for its most significant subsidiaries, the need to reinvest earnings locally and the overall cash requirements of the Company. Based upon this evaluation, the Company determined that certain undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. The Company believes that it can generate sufficient cash flows to avoid the one-time tax costs associated with repatriation of undistributed earnings to the U.S. from prior periods. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, such earnings were approximately $528 million and $547 million, respectively. It is not practical to determine the deferred income tax liability on these earnings if, in the future, they are remitted to the U.S. because the income tax liability to be incurred, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs.\nThe Company has not materially changed the methodology for calculating income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions for the years presented or for quarterly periods. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional information.\nResearch and Development\nInternal funding for research and development was as follows:\n\nThe amounts shown exclude technology development and engineering costs classified in cost of services sold; cost of products sold; or selling, general and administrative expenses.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nInformation on recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards is included in Note 2, Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nDividend Action\nThe Board normally reviews the dividend policy and the dividend rate on a quarterly basis.\nThe Company paid one cash dividend of $0.05125 per share in 2016.

"summary": " Here are the key points from the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:\n\n- In November 2016, Harsco entered into a new $400 million revolving credit facility and $550 million term loan. It used the proceeds to repay existing debt and reduce leverage.\n\n- In September 2016, Harsco sold its remaining 26% stake in Brand Energy & Infrastructure Services for $145 million of net cash proceeds. This improved liquidity.\n\n- Harsco Metals & Minerals segment continued to be impacted by lower steel production and weak commodity prices in 2016. But cost savings initiatives like Project Orion helped offset some of the weakness.\n\n- Harsco took charges in 2016 related to cost overruns on railway maintenance contracts for the Swiss federal railway. This reduced profitability of the Harsco Rail segment. \n\n- Weaker energy market continued to negatively impact revenues and operating income in the Harsco Industrial segment in 2016.\n\n- Harsco announced its intention to pursue separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals business to unlock value.\n\n- In 2016, revenues declined 16% to $1.45 billion and operating income declined 28% to $63.5 million compared to prior year. Lower volumes and adverse foreign currency movements were key factors behind the declines.\n\n- Harsco generated operating cash flow of $159.8 million in 2016, helped by working capital improvements. Capital expenditures declined to $69.3 million.  \n\n- Going forward, Harsco will focus on improving returns from existing businesses and disciplined investments for growth. Managing costs and the business portfolio will remain priorities."}
