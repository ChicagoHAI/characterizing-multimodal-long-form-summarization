MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed the Transactions to combine GE O&G and Baker Hughes, creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated oilfield products, services and digital solutions. The Transactions were executed using a partnership structure, pursuant to which GE O&G and Baker Hughes each contributed their operating assets to the Company. As of December 31, 2018, GE holds an approximate 50.4% interest in us and BHGE holds an approximate 49.6% interest. GE's interest is held through a voting interest of Class B Common Stock in BHGE and its economic interest through a corresponding number of our common units. The results of operations for the Company include the results of Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017, the date of acquisition, through December 31, 2018. The majority of the Baker Hughes business operations are included in the Oilfield Services segment. The Transactions were treated as a reverse acquisition\u201d for accounting purposes and, as such, the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer, GE O&G, are the historical financial statements of the Company. The current year results may not be comparable to prior years as the prior years include the results of Baker Hughes only from July 3, 2017. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Processing Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS). As of December 31, 2018, BHGE LLC employs approximately 66,000 employees and operates in more than 120 countries.\nIn June 2018, GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from BHGE over time. To that end, during the fourth quarter of 2018, certain equity transactions were completed and GE's ownership of BHGE was reduced from approximately 62.5% to approximately 50.4%. At the same time, we completed the Master Agreement Framework designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaboration between us and GE and to position us for the future. The Master Agreement Framework focuses on areas where we work most closely with GE on developing leading technology and executing for customers. First, we defined the parameters for long-term collaboration and partnership with GE on critical rotating equipment technology. Second, for our Digital software and technology business we will maintain the status quo as the exclusive supplier of GE Digital oil-and-gas applications. Finally, we reached agreements on a number of other areas including our Controls business, pension, taxes, and intercompany services. For further details on the Master Agreement Framework see \"Note 16. Related Party Disclosures\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nIn aggregate, we anticipate that the net financial impact of the agreements contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework will have a slightly negative impact on our operating margin rates of approximately 20 to 40 basis points. In addition, we expect to incur one-time charges related to separation from GE of approximately $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over the next three years. We expect these charges to be primarily related to the build-out of information technology infrastructure as well as customary transaction fees. For a discussion of certain risks associated with separation, including risks related to our business, financial condition and results of operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Factors Related to the Transactions and Separation from GE.\u201d\nIn 2018, we generated revenue of $22,877 million, compared to $17,179 million in 2017. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by OFS as 2018 included the full year results of Baker Hughes compared to only six months in 2017, and to a lesser extent, by DS partially offset by declines in TPS and OFE. Income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $680 million in 2018, and included restructuring and impairment charges of $433 million and merger and related costs of $153 million. These restructuring and impairment charges were recorded as a result of our continued actions to adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced activity levels. In 2017, loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $335 million, which also included restructuring and impairment charges of $412 million, and merger and related costs of $373 million.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 24\nOUTLOOK\nOur business is exposed to a number of different macro factors, which influence our expectations and outlook. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today, and are subject to change given volatile conditions in the industry.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>North America onshore activity: in 2018, we experienced an acceleration in rig count growth, as compared to 2017, driven by the increase in commodity prices for the first 10 months of the year. In the fourth quarter, WTI prices declined 38% driven by both increased supply and geo-political events. We expect the decline in commodity prices may have a negative impact on activity in North America in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>International onshore activity: we have seen a moderate increase in rig count activity in 2018 and expect growth to continue into 2019, at a slightly increased rate. We have seen signs of improvement with the increase in commodity prices, but due to continued volatility, we remain cautious as to growth expectations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Offshore projects: although commodity prices have been volatile, we have begun to see increasing customer activity on offshore projects and more final investment decisions being made. Subsea tree awards increased in 2018, and we expect tree awards to be roughly flat in 2019, though still at levels significantly below prior 2012 and 2013 peaks. We expect customers to continue to evaluate the timing of final investment decisions, and in light of increased commodity price volatility, there may be some project delays.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects: we remain optimistic on the LNG market. While currently oversupplied, we believe a significant number of final investment decisions are needed to fill the projected supply-demand imbalance in the early to middle part of the next decade. In 2018, we saw positive final investment decisions for new LNG capacity. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive given our outlook for supply and demand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Refinery, petrochemical and industrial projects: in refining, we believe large, complex refineries should gain advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape in 2019 as the industry globalizes and refiners position to meet local demand and secure export potential. In petrochemicals, we continue to see healthy demand and cost-advantaged supply driving projects forward in 2019. The industrial market continues to grow as outdated infrastructure is replaced, policy changes come into effect and power is decentralized. We continue to see growing demand across these markets in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with different industrial metrics such as our Digital Solutions business. Overall, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the value chain, and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the industry, but are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing assumptions in the near term.\nSolar and wind net additions continued to exceed coal and gas throughout 2018. Governments may change or may not continue incentives for renewable energy additions. In the long term, renewables' cost decline may accelerate to compete with new-built fossil capacity. However, we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future.\nDespite the near-term volatility, the long-term outlook for our industry remains positive. We believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity, requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technology from oilfield service companies. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, cost-efficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 25\nshould be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes of the Company.\nWe operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\n</td> <td>65.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\n</td> <td>3.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Energy Information Administration (EIA) Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>EIA Cushing, OK WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\n</td> </tr>\n</table> 2018 demonstrated the volatility of the oil and gas market. Through the first three quarters of 2018, we experienced stability in the North American and international markets. However, in the fourth quarter of 2018 commodity prices dropped nearly 40% resulting in increased customer uncertainty. From an offshore standpoint, through most of 2018, we saw multiple large offshore projects reach positive final investment decisions, and the LNG market and outlook improved throughout 2018, driven by increased demand globally. In 2018, the first large North American LNG positive final investment decision was reached.\nOutside of North America, customer spending is highly driven by Brent oil prices, which increased on average throughout the year. Average Brent oil prices increased to $71.34/Bbl in 2018 from $54.12/Bbl in 2017, and ranged from a low of $50.57/Bbl in December 2018, to a high of $86.07/Bbl in October 2018. For the first three quarters of 2018, Brent oil prices increased sequentially. However, in the fourth quarter, Brent oil prices declined 39% versus the end of the third quarter, as a result of increased supply from the U.S., worries of a global economic slowdown, and lower than expected production cuts.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similar to Brent oil prices, on average increased throughout the year. Average WTI oil prices increased to $65.23/Bbl in 2018 from $50.80/Bbl in 2017, and ranged from a low of $44.48/Bbl in December 2018, to a high of $77.41/Bbl in June 2018.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $3.15/mmBtu in 2018, representing a 6% increase over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $6.24/mmBtu in January 2018 to a low of $2.49/mmBtu in February 2018. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2018 was 2,705 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which was 15.6%, or 421 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2017.\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 26\nstrength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>1,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide\n</td> <td>2,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOverall the rig count was 2,211 in 2018, an increase of 9% as compared to 2017 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America increased 13% in 2018 compared to 2017. Internationally, the rig count increased 4% in 2018 as compared to the same period last year.\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was up 18% on average versus 2017, partially offset with a decrease in the Canadian rig count, which was down 8% on average. Internationally, the improvement in the rig count was driven primarily by increases in the Africa region of 18%, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America region, were also up by 9% and 3%, respectively, partially offset by the Europe region, which was down 8%.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOverall the rig count was 2,030 in 2017, an increase of 27% as compared to 2016 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America increased 69% in 2017 compared to 2016. Internationally, the rig count decreased 1% in 2017 as compared to the same period last year.\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the land rig count, which was up 72%, partially offset by a decrease in the offshore rig count of 16%. Internationally, the rig count decrease was driven primarily by decreases in Latin America of 7%, the Europe region and Africa region, which were down by 4% and 2%, respectively, partially offset by the Asia-Pacific region, which was up 8%.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 27\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nThe results of operations for the Company include the results of Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017, the date of acquisition, through the year ended December 31, 2018. Our results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level.\nThe performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following: net interest expense, net other non operating income, corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, inventory impairment, merger and related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:\nVolume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (FX): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the US dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation & benefits and overhead costs.\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume & price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nOrders: We recognized orders of $23,904 million, $17,159 million, and $11,066 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, service orders were up 36% and equipment orders were up 45%, compared to 2017. In 2017, service orders were up 39% and equipment orders were up 88%, compared to 2016. The increase in orders in 2018 and 2017 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $21.0 billion in each year, respectively.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 28\nRevenue and Segment Operating Income (Loss) Before Tax\nRevenue and segment operating income (loss) for each of our four operating segments is provided below.

in 2018 was $22,877 million, an increase of $5,698 million, or 33%, from 2017. This increase in revenue was largely a result of the incremental Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. OFS increased $5,736 million, DS increased $262 million, OFE decreased $20 million, and TPS decreased $280 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2018 was $1,796 million, an increase of $681 million, or 61%, from 2017. The increase was primarily driven by OFS, which increased $718 million, and DS, which increased $33 million, partially offset by TPS, which decreased $44 million, and OFE, which decreased $26 million.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 29\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2018 revenue was $11,617 million, an increase of $5,736 million from 2017, primarily as a result of having the full year of Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. In addition to the incremental revenue from Baker Hughes, the improvement in revenue was also due to increased activity in the North American and international markets compared to the prior year as evidenced by the 9% increase in the worldwide rig counts.\nOFS 2018 segment operating income was $785 million, compared to $67 million in 2017. The additional contribution resulting from the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and to a lesser extent higher activity and synergy benefits, drove the increase in operating income.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2018 revenue was $2,641 million, a decrease of $20 million, or 1%, from 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volume in the flexible pipe business. Additionally, the decrease was driven by lower opening RPO in the subsea production systems business, partially offset with higher volume in the surface pressure control and services businesses.\nOFE 2018 segment operating income was breakeven, compared to $26 million in 2017. This decline in profitability was primarily driven by a negative mix of long-term projects, and to a lesser extent foreign exchange headwinds. Deflation savings and positive cost productivity only partially offset the decrease.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2018 revenue was $6,015 million, a decrease of $280 million, or 4%, from 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the businesses that serve the upstream segments, and to a lesser extent by lower volume in the businesses that serve the downstream segments. Equipment revenue in 2018 represented 40% and Service revenue represented 60% of total revenue.\nTPS 2018 segment operating income was $621 million, compared to $665 million in 2017. The decline in profitability was driven primarily by lower volume, and to a lesser extent by negative cost productivity. The decrease was partially offset by a favorable business mix and cost reduction actions implemented by the Company.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2018 revenue was $2,604 million, an increase of $262 million, or 11%, from 2017, primarily as a result of the incremental Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. Outside of this contribution, a decrease in the controls business due to softness in the power end-market was more than offset by revenue increases across all other product lines.\nDS 2018 segment operating income was $390 million, compared to $357 million in 2017. The increase in profitability was driven by positive cost productivity, including synergy benefits.\nCorporate\nIn 2018, corporate expenses were $405 million, an increase of $35 million compared to 2017, primarily from the additional expenses related to the acquisition of Baker Hughes partially offset by realized synergies.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2018, we recognized $433 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, an increase of $21 million compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to costs driven by the implementation of our synergy plans.\nMerger and Related Costs\nWe recorded $153 million of merger and related costs in 2018, a decrease of $220 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in costs as we finalize our merger related activities partially offset by costs incurred in relation to the anticipated separation from GE.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 30\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2018, we incurred net interest expense of $223 million, an increase of $92 million from the prior year, primarily driven by $3.95 billion of debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 and debt obtained in the Baker Hughes acquisition, partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with the retirement of debt of $615 million in January of 2018. In addition, interest expense declined as we ceased participation in the GE receivables monetization program.\nEquity in Loss of Affiliate\nIn 2018, we recorded a loss of $139 million related to our equity method investment in BJ Services. As a result, we discontinued applying the equity method. We will resume application of the equity method only after our share of unrecognized net income equals our share of net loss not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. There is no cash impact to BHGE.\nIncome Tax\nIn 2018, our income tax expense increased by $256 million, from $146 million in 2017 to $402 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher foreign taxes related to increased foreign earnings and geographical mix of earnings. In addition, since we are a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes, any tax benefits associated with U.S. losses are recognized by our members and not reflected in our tax expense.\nFiscal Year 2017 to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenue in 2017 was $17,179 million, an increase of $4,097 million, or 31%, from 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Baker Hughes. OFS increased $5,093 million, DS increased $256 million, OFE decreased $879 million, and TPS decreased $373 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2017 was $1,115 million, a decrease of $404 million, or 27%, from 2016. The acquisition of Baker Hughes added $321 million of segment operating income, but was more than offset by the organic impact of lower productivity and pricing pressure. OFS increased $274 million, TPS decreased $393 million, OFE decreased $279 million and DS decreased $6 million.\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2017 revenue was $5,881 million, an increase of $5,093 million from 2016, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Baker Hughes on July 3, 2017.\nOFS 2017 segment operating income was $67 million, compared to a loss of $207 million in 2016. The acquisition of Baker Hughes added $327 million of segment operating income, which includes increased depreciation & amortization expense driven by purchase accounting, partially offset by pricing pressure.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2017 revenue was $2,661 million, a decrease of $879 million, or 25%, from 2016. The revenue decline was primarily due to continued volume pressures and to a lesser extent to negative pricing, driven by the delays in final investment decisions by our customers in prior years.\nOFE 2017 segment operating income was $26 million, compared to $305 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was the result of negative productivity and volume, while strong deflation savings more than offset pricing pressures.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2017 revenue was $6,295 million, a decrease of $373 million, or 6%, from 2016. The decline was primarily attributable to negative pricing and to a lesser extent to volume decreases, driven by lower equipment contracts being awarded in prior years and continued softness in the services market.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 31\nTPS 2017 segment operating income was $665 million, compared to $1,058 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was primarily due to unfavorable cost productivity. Other factors were lower margin equipment backlog throughput and the impact of negative pricing.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2017 revenue was $2,342 million, an increase of $256 million, or 12%, from 2016, driven by the acquisition of Baker Hughes which added $211 million of revenue versus the prior year.\nDS 2017 segment operating income was $357 million, compared to $363 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was primarily driven by the Baker Hughes acquisition contributing a $5 million segment operating loss.\nCorporate\nIn 2017, corporate expenses were $370 million, a decrease of $5 million compared to 2016. This was primarily due to selective decreases in R&D program investments and cost productivity.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2017, we recognized $412 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, a decrease of $104 million compared to 2016. This decrease was driven by the absence of any significant currency devaluations in Angola and Nigeria that were experienced in 2016.\nMerger and Related Costs\nWe recorded $373 million of merger and related costs in 2017, an increase of $340 million from the prior year, primarily related to the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2017, we incurred net interest expense of $131 million, an increase of $29 million from the prior year, primarily driven by the debt acquired on the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nIncome Tax\nIn 2017, our income tax expense decreased by $27 million, from $173 million in 2016 to $146 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a benefit of $32 million related to recent U.S. tax reform and a decline in profit. In addition, since we are a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes, any tax benefits associated with U.S. losses are recognized by our members and not reflected in our tax expense.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe, in the conduct of all of our activities, are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical and quality standards (Standards) as also reported in our Quality Management System (QMS). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. To ensure that we live up to our high Standards, we devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (Compliance Program) which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond in a timely fashion to any potential violations of law, our Code of Conduct (The Spirit & The Letter), and other BHGE policies and procedures.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 32\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations connected to government officials; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes.

At December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $3,677 million compared to $7,026 million at December 31, 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash includes $747 million and $997 million of cash held on behalf of GE at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nExcluding cash held on behalf of GE, our US subsidiaries held approximately $0.7 billion and $3.6 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2018 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., we may be required to provide taxes on certain of those funds, however, due to\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 33\nthe enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.\nWe have a five-year $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with commercial banks maturing in July 2022. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, certain affirmative covenants and no negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement, and other customary defaults. We were in compliance with all of the credit facility's covenants, and in 2018 there were no borrowings under the credit facility.\nWe have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time up to $3 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. At December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program. The maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the 2017 Credit Agreement and the commercial paper program is $3 billion.\nIf market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs and restructuring costs, capital expenditures, the repayment of debt, repurchase of our Units and distribution to members. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(798\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(472\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(4,381\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to product or services sales including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,738 million and used cash of $798 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased $2,536 million in 2018 primarily driven by better operating performance. These cash inflows were supported by strong working capital cash flows, especially in the fourth quarter of 2018, including approximately $300 million for a progress collection payment from a customer. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2018 and 2017 are payments of $473 million and $612 million, respectively, made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and merger and related costs.\nCash flows from operating activities used $798 million and generated $262 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1,061 million in 2017 primarily driven by a $1,201 million negative impact from ending our receivables monetization program in the fourth quarter, and restructuring related payments throughout the year. These cash outflows were partially offset by strong working capital cash flows, especially in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in our cash flows from operating\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 34\nactivities for 2017 and 2016 are payments of $612 million and $177 million, respectively, made for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and merger and related costs.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $578 million, $4,123 million and $472 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $995 million, $665 million and $424 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $458 million, $172 million and $20 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lost-in-hole, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period. In 2018, the Company received $453 million from the sale of businesses primarily driven by the sale of its Natural Gas Solution (NGS) business for $375 million. Also in 2018, the Company and ADNOC signed a strategic partnership agreement under which the Company acquired a five percent stake in ADNOC Drilling for a cash consideration of $500 million.\nIn 2017, cash flows from investing activities also includes $7,498 million of distribution to BHGE to fund the special dividend paid by BHGE to former Baker Hughes stockholders on the acquisition of Baker Hughes, net of $4,133 million of cash received from the acquisition.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities used cash of $4,381 million, generated cash of $10,914 million and used cash of $102 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring 2018, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to our members through repurchase of our Units and distributions to members. Specifically, we used cash of $1 billion to repurchase our Units from our members on a pro rata basis. Additionally, in November 2018, we repurchased 65 million Units from GE for a cash consideration of $1,461 million. As of December 31, 2018, the stock repurchase program has been substantially completed. During 2018, we made a distribution to our members of $824 million.\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $376 million and $663 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Repayment of our long-term debt in 2018 consisted primarily of repayment of certain Senior Notes and capital leases for a total consideration of $684 million.\nIn 2017, our primary source of financing cash flows was a contribution of $7,400 million from GE to fund substantially all of the distribution made to BHGE for the special dividend paid to former Baker Hughes stockholders. We also generated financing cash flows of $3,950 million from debt issued through a private placement offering in December 2017. We incurred issuance costs of $26 million related to this debt issuance.\nIn December 2017, we purchased $176 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount associated with our long-term outstanding notes and debentures. Pursuant to a cash tender offer, the purchases resulted in the payment of an early-tender premium, including various fees of $28 million.\nAdditionally, in 2017, we made a distribution of $406 million to our members and used $477 million of cash to repurchase our Units from our members, including GE, on a pro rata basis. The repurchases in 2017 did not result in a change of GE's approximate 62.5% interest in us.\nCash flows from financing activities in 2017 also included net transfers from GE of $1,498 million primarily driven by the cash pooling activity with GE prior to the Transactions. Other financing items during the year included a payment of $193 million to complete the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in the Pipeline Inspection and Integrity business within Digital Solutions.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 35\nCash Requirements\nIn 2019, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and distribution to members, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. In light of the current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2019 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $425 million to $475 million in 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>3,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including capital lease obligations.

Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. and international employees. During 2018, we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately $72 million in connection with those plans, and we anticipate funding approximately $41 million during 2019. Amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change, therefore, we are currently not\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 36\nable to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2019. See \"Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2018. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases, as discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nRegistration Statements: In November 2018, BHGE filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2021.\nIn December 2017, we and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to have the ability to sell up to $3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2020.\nCustomer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2018, 24% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States. Other than the United States, no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at this date. As of December 31, 2017, 20% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States.\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S., is 81% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2018. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 37\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Many of these estimates include determining fair value. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and longlived assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated and combined financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our TPS segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of 15 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates.\nRevenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review.\nThe difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract liability (billings in excess of revenue). See \"Note 8. Contract and other deferred assets\" and \"Note 9. Progress collections and deferred income\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 38\nthrough supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $26 million, $44 million and $113 million for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident.\nOn December 31, 2018, our long-term product service agreements, net of related billings in excess of revenues of $0.4 billion represent approximately 4.3% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $10.3 billion. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion and $0.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 16% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1% would increase or decrease the long-term product service agreements balance by $0.04 billion.\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually using data as of July 1 of that year. The impairment test consists of two different steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value, in step two, which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. We determine fair values of each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed.\nPension Assumptions\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits, lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 3.43%, 2.99% and 3.41%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates. Our expected return on assets at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 5.94%, 6.26% and 6.86%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the U.S. GAAP in these various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. However, as a result of U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our prior unrepatriated foreign earnings were subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without incremental U.S. federal tax. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we changed our intent regarding certain cash repatriations and have accrued an additional $9 million of foreign withholding taxes. As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative amount of indefinitely\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 39\nreinvested foreign earnings is approximately $6.3 billion. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform) that lowers the statutory tax rate on U.S. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from U.S. taxation at a reduced rate of tax (transition tax), establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations.\nThe impact of U.S. tax reform was initially recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provided for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax. Based on guidance received to date, finalization of purchase accounting for the Baker Hughes acquisition and finalization of our 2017 U.S. income tax returns, we have recorded a $25 million tax expense in 2018.\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\" payments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). We have made an accounting policy election to account for these taxes as period costs.\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $472 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2018. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.\nThe preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $327 million and $330 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions, however, uncertainties\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 40\nregarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, inventory reserves totaled $430 million and $360 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nAcquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nSee \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of accounting standards to be adopted.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSee \"Note 16. Related Party Transactions\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of related party transactions.\nOTHER ITEMS\nBrexit\nIn June 2016, UK voters approved the UK's exit (Brexit) from the EU. The UK is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU scheduled for March 29, 2019. There remains significant uncertainty as to whether the withdrawal agreement between the UK government and the EU will be approved, when, if and on what terms Brexit will happen. There is a range of outcomes possible, from no Brexit to an abrupt cut-off of the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. The above withdrawal agreement contemplates a transition period from March 2019 through December 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed.\nAlthough our customer base is global with predominant exposure to the U.S. dollar, we have a manufacturing and service base in the UK with some euro procurement, thus we are exposed to fluctuations in value of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar, euro and other currencies. We have a hedging program which looks to accommodate this potential volatility.\nIran Threat Reduction And Syria Human Rights Act Of 2012\nThe Company is making the following disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, enacted in 2012, we are required to disclose in\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 41\nour periodic reports if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in business activities relating to Iran, even if those activities are conducted in accordance with authorizations subsequently issued by the U.S. Government. Reportable activities include investments that significantly enhance Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources valued at $20 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period. Reporting is also required for transactions related to Iran's domestic production of refined petroleum products or Iran's ability to import refined petroleum products valued at $5 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period.\nIn January 2016, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License H authorizing U.S.-owned or controlled foreign entities to engage in transactions with Iran if these entities meet the requirements of the general license. On May 8, 2018, President Trump announced that the United States will cease participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and begin re-imposing the U.S. nuclear-related sanctions. On June 27, 2018, OFAC revoked General License H and added Section 560.537 to the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR), which authorized all transactions and activities that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the winding down of activities previously approved under General License H through November 4, 2018. Prior to May 8, 2018, certain non-U.S. BHGE affiliates conducted limited activities as described below, in accordance with General License H.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed the Transactions to combine GE O&G and Baker Hughes, creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated oilfield products, services and digital solutions. The Transactions were executed using a partnership structure, pursuant to which GE O&G and Baker Hughes each contributed their operating assets to the Company. As of December 31, 2018, GE holds an approximate 50.4% interest in us and BHGE holds an approximate 49.6% interest. GE's interest is held through a voting interest of Class B Common Stock in BHGE and its economic interest through a corresponding number of our common units. The results of operations for the Company include the results of Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017, the date of acquisition, through December 31, 2018. The majority of the Baker Hughes business operations are included in the Oilfield Services segment. The Transactions were treated as a reverse acquisition\u201d for accounting purposes and, as such, the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer, GE O&G, are the historical financial statements of the Company. The current year results may not be comparable to prior years as the prior years include the results of Baker Hughes only from July 3, 2017. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Processing Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS). As of December 31, 2018, BHGE LLC employs approximately 66,000 employees and operates in more than 120 countries.\nIn June 2018, GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from BHGE over time. To that end, during the fourth quarter of 2018, certain equity transactions were completed and GE's ownership of BHGE was reduced from approximately 62.5% to approximately 50.4%. At the same time, we completed the Master Agreement Framework designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaboration between us and GE and to position us for the future. The Master Agreement Framework focuses on areas where we work most closely with GE on developing leading technology and executing for customers. First, we defined the parameters for long-term collaboration and partnership with GE on critical rotating equipment technology. Second, for our Digital software and technology business we will maintain the status quo as the exclusive supplier of GE Digital oil-and-gas applications. Finally, we reached agreements on a number of other areas including our Controls business, pension, taxes, and intercompany services. For further details on the Master Agreement Framework see \"Note 16. Related Party Disclosures\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nIn aggregate, we anticipate that the net financial impact of the agreements contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework will have a slightly negative impact on our operating margin rates of approximately 20 to 40 basis points. In addition, we expect to incur one-time charges related to separation from GE of approximately $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over the next three years. We expect these charges to be primarily related to the build-out of information technology infrastructure as well as customary transaction fees. For a discussion of certain risks associated with separation, including risks related to our business, financial condition and results of operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Factors Related to the Transactions and Separation from GE.\u201d\nIn 2018, we generated revenue of $22,877 million, compared to $17,179 million in 2017. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by OFS as 2018 included the full year results of Baker Hughes compared to only six months in 2017, and to a lesser extent, by DS partially offset by declines in TPS and OFE. Income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $680 million in 2018, and included restructuring and impairment charges of $433 million and merger and related costs of $153 million. These restructuring and impairment charges were recorded as a result of our continued actions to adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced activity levels. In 2017, loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $335 million, which also included restructuring and impairment charges of $412 million, and merger and related costs of $373 million.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 24\nOUTLOOK\nOur business is exposed to a number of different macro factors, which influence our expectations and outlook. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today, and are subject to change given volatile conditions in the industry.\n \u2022 North America onshore activity: in 2018, we experienced an acceleration in rig count growth, as compared to 2017, driven by the increase in commodity prices for the first 10 months of the year. In the fourth quarter, WTI prices declined 38% driven by both increased supply and geo-political events. We expect the decline in commodity prices may have a negative impact on activity in North America in 2019. \n \u2022 International onshore activity: we have seen a moderate increase in rig count activity in 2018 and expect growth to continue into 2019, at a slightly increased rate. We have seen signs of improvement with the increase in commodity prices, but due to continued volatility, we remain cautious as to growth expectations. \n \u2022 Offshore projects: although commodity prices have been volatile, we have begun to see increasing customer activity on offshore projects and more final investment decisions being made. Subsea tree awards increased in 2018, and we expect tree awards to be roughly flat in 2019, though still at levels significantly below prior 2012 and 2013 peaks. We expect customers to continue to evaluate the timing of final investment decisions, and in light of increased commodity price volatility, there may be some project delays. \n \u2022 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects: we remain optimistic on the LNG market. While currently oversupplied, we believe a significant number of final investment decisions are needed to fill the projected supply-demand imbalance in the early to middle part of the next decade. In 2018, we saw positive final investment decisions for new LNG capacity. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive given our outlook for supply and demand. \n \u2022 Refinery, petrochemical and industrial projects: in refining, we believe large, complex refineries should gain advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape in 2019 as the industry globalizes and refiners position to meet local demand and secure export potential. In petrochemicals, we continue to see healthy demand and cost-advantaged supply driving projects forward in 2019. The industrial market continues to grow as outdated infrastructure is replaced, policy changes come into effect and power is decentralized. We continue to see growing demand across these markets in 2019.  We have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with different industrial metrics such as our Digital Solutions business. Overall, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the value chain, and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the industry, but are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing assumptions in the near term.\nSolar and wind net additions continued to exceed coal and gas throughout 2018. Governments may change or may not continue incentives for renewable energy additions. In the long term, renewables' cost decline may accelerate to compete with new-built fossil capacity. However, we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future.\nDespite the near-term volatility, the long-term outlook for our industry remains positive. We believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity, requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technology from oilfield service companies. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, cost-efficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 25\nshould be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes of the Company.\nWe operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\n</td> <td>65.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\n</td> <td>3.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Energy Information Administration (EIA) Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel \n (2) EIA Cushing, OK WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price \n (3) EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit  2018 demonstrated the volatility of the oil and gas market. Through the first three quarters of 2018, we experienced stability in the North American and international markets. However, in the fourth quarter of 2018 commodity prices dropped nearly 40% resulting in increased customer uncertainty. From an offshore standpoint, through most of 2018, we saw multiple large offshore projects reach positive final investment decisions, and the LNG market and outlook improved throughout 2018, driven by increased demand globally. In 2018, the first large North American LNG positive final investment decision was reached.\nOutside of North America, customer spending is highly driven by Brent oil prices, which increased on average throughout the year. Average Brent oil prices increased to $71.34/Bbl in 2018 from $54.12/Bbl in 2017, and ranged from a low of $50.57/Bbl in December 2018, to a high of $86.07/Bbl in October 2018. For the first three quarters of 2018, Brent oil prices increased sequentially. However, in the fourth quarter, Brent oil prices declined 39% versus the end of the third quarter, as a result of increased supply from the U.S., worries of a global economic slowdown, and lower than expected production cuts.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similar to Brent oil prices, on average increased throughout the year. Average WTI oil prices increased to $65.23/Bbl in 2018 from $50.80/Bbl in 2017, and ranged from a low of $44.48/Bbl in December 2018, to a high of $77.41/Bbl in June 2018.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $3.15/mmBtu in 2018, representing a 6% increase over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $6.24/mmBtu in January 2018 to a low of $2.49/mmBtu in February 2018. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2018 was 2,705 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which was 15.6%, or 421 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2017.\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 26\nstrength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>1,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide\n</td> <td>2,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOverall the rig count was 2,211 in 2018, an increase of 9% as compared to 2017 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America increased 13% in 2018 compared to 2017. Internationally, the rig count increased 4% in 2018 as compared to the same period last year.\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was up 18% on average versus 2017, partially offset with a decrease in the Canadian rig count, which was down 8% on average. Internationally, the improvement in the rig count was driven primarily by increases in the Africa region of 18%, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America region, were also up by 9% and 3%, respectively, partially offset by the Europe region, which was down 8%.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOverall the rig count was 2,030 in 2017, an increase of 27% as compared to 2016 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America increased 69% in 2017 compared to 2016. Internationally, the rig count decreased 1% in 2017 as compared to the same period last year.\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the land rig count, which was up 72%, partially offset by a decrease in the offshore rig count of 16%. Internationally, the rig count decrease was driven primarily by decreases in Latin America of 7%, the Europe region and Africa region, which were down by 4% and 2%, respectively, partially offset by the Asia-Pacific region, which was up 8%.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 27\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nThe results of operations for the Company include the results of Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017, the date of acquisition, through the year ended December 31, 2018. Our results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level.\nThe performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following: net interest expense, net other non operating income, corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, inventory impairment, merger and related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:\nVolume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (FX): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the US dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation & benefits and overhead costs.\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume & price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nOrders: We recognized orders of $23,904 million, $17,159 million, and $11,066 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, service orders were up 36% and equipment orders were up 45%, compared to 2017. In 2017, service orders were up 39% and equipment orders were up 88%, compared to 2016. The increase in orders in 2018 and 2017 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $21.0 billion in each year, respectively.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 28\nRevenue and Segment Operating Income (Loss) Before Tax\nRevenue and segment operating income (loss) for each of our four operating segments is provided below.

consolidated and combined statements of income (loss). 2017 includes $87 million of adjustments to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value on acquisition of Baker Hughes as this inventory was used or sold in the six months ended December 31, 2017.  Fiscal Year 2018 to Fiscal Year 2017\nRevenue in 2018 was $22,877 million, an increase of $5,698 million, or 33%, from 2017. This increase in revenue was largely a result of the incremental Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. OFS increased $5,736 million, DS increased $262 million, OFE decreased $20 million, and TPS decreased $280 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2018 was $1,796 million, an increase of $681 million, or 61%, from 2017. The increase was primarily driven by OFS, which increased $718 million, and DS, which increased $33 million, partially offset by TPS, which decreased $44 million, and OFE, which decreased $26 million.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 29\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2018 revenue was $11,617 million, an increase of $5,736 million from 2017, primarily as a result of having the full year of Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. In addition to the incremental revenue from Baker Hughes, the improvement in revenue was also due to increased activity in the North American and international markets compared to the prior year as evidenced by the 9% increase in the worldwide rig counts.\nOFS 2018 segment operating income was $785 million, compared to $67 million in 2017. The additional contribution resulting from the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and to a lesser extent higher activity and synergy benefits, drove the increase in operating income.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2018 revenue was $2,641 million, a decrease of $20 million, or 1%, from 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volume in the flexible pipe business. Additionally, the decrease was driven by lower opening RPO in the subsea production systems business, partially offset with higher volume in the surface pressure control and services businesses.\nOFE 2018 segment operating income was breakeven, compared to $26 million in 2017. This decline in profitability was primarily driven by a negative mix of long-term projects, and to a lesser extent foreign exchange headwinds. Deflation savings and positive cost productivity only partially offset the decrease.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2018 revenue was $6,015 million, a decrease of $280 million, or 4%, from 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the businesses that serve the upstream segments, and to a lesser extent by lower volume in the businesses that serve the downstream segments. Equipment revenue in 2018 represented 40% and Service revenue represented 60% of total revenue.\nTPS 2018 segment operating income was $621 million, compared to $665 million in 2017. The decline in profitability was driven primarily by lower volume, and to a lesser extent by negative cost productivity. The decrease was partially offset by a favorable business mix and cost reduction actions implemented by the Company.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2018 revenue was $2,604 million, an increase of $262 million, or 11%, from 2017, primarily as a result of the incremental Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. Outside of this contribution, a decrease in the controls business due to softness in the power end-market was more than offset by revenue increases across all other product lines.\nDS 2018 segment operating income was $390 million, compared to $357 million in 2017. The increase in profitability was driven by positive cost productivity, including synergy benefits.\nCorporate\nIn 2018, corporate expenses were $405 million, an increase of $35 million compared to 2017, primarily from the additional expenses related to the acquisition of Baker Hughes partially offset by realized synergies.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2018, we recognized $433 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, an increase of $21 million compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to costs driven by the implementation of our synergy plans.\nMerger and Related Costs\nWe recorded $153 million of merger and related costs in 2018, a decrease of $220 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in costs as we finalize our merger related activities partially offset by costs incurred in relation to the anticipated separation from GE.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 30\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2018, we incurred net interest expense of $223 million, an increase of $92 million from the prior year, primarily driven by $3.95 billion of debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 and debt obtained in the Baker Hughes acquisition, partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with the retirement of debt of $615 million in January of 2018. In addition, interest expense declined as we ceased participation in the GE receivables monetization program.\nEquity in Loss of Affiliate\nIn 2018, we recorded a loss of $139 million related to our equity method investment in BJ Services. As a result, we discontinued applying the equity method. We will resume application of the equity method only after our share of unrecognized net income equals our share of net loss not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. There is no cash impact to BHGE.\nIncome Tax\nIn 2018, our income tax expense increased by $256 million, from $146 million in 2017 to $402 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher foreign taxes related to increased foreign earnings and geographical mix of earnings. In addition, since we are a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes, any tax benefits associated with U.S. losses are recognized by our members and not reflected in our tax expense.\nFiscal Year 2017 to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenue in 2017 was $17,179 million, an increase of $4,097 million, or 31%, from 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Baker Hughes. OFS increased $5,093 million, DS increased $256 million, OFE decreased $879 million, and TPS decreased $373 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2017 was $1,115 million, a decrease of $404 million, or 27%, from 2016. The acquisition of Baker Hughes added $321 million of segment operating income, but was more than offset by the organic impact of lower productivity and pricing pressure. OFS increased $274 million, TPS decreased $393 million, OFE decreased $279 million and DS decreased $6 million.\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2017 revenue was $5,881 million, an increase of $5,093 million from 2016, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Baker Hughes on July 3, 2017.\nOFS 2017 segment operating income was $67 million, compared to a loss of $207 million in 2016. The acquisition of Baker Hughes added $327 million of segment operating income, which includes increased depreciation & amortization expense driven by purchase accounting, partially offset by pricing pressure.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2017 revenue was $2,661 million, a decrease of $879 million, or 25%, from 2016. The revenue decline was primarily due to continued volume pressures and to a lesser extent to negative pricing, driven by the delays in final investment decisions by our customers in prior years.\nOFE 2017 segment operating income was $26 million, compared to $305 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was the result of negative productivity and volume, while strong deflation savings more than offset pricing pressures.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2017 revenue was $6,295 million, a decrease of $373 million, or 6%, from 2016. The decline was primarily attributable to negative pricing and to a lesser extent to volume decreases, driven by lower equipment contracts being awarded in prior years and continued softness in the services market.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 31\nTPS 2017 segment operating income was $665 million, compared to $1,058 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was primarily due to unfavorable cost productivity. Other factors were lower margin equipment backlog throughput and the impact of negative pricing.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2017 revenue was $2,342 million, an increase of $256 million, or 12%, from 2016, driven by the acquisition of Baker Hughes which added $211 million of revenue versus the prior year.\nDS 2017 segment operating income was $357 million, compared to $363 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was primarily driven by the Baker Hughes acquisition contributing a $5 million segment operating loss.\nCorporate\nIn 2017, corporate expenses were $370 million, a decrease of $5 million compared to 2016. This was primarily due to selective decreases in R&D program investments and cost productivity.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2017, we recognized $412 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, a decrease of $104 million compared to 2016. This decrease was driven by the absence of any significant currency devaluations in Angola and Nigeria that were experienced in 2016.\nMerger and Related Costs\nWe recorded $373 million of merger and related costs in 2017, an increase of $340 million from the prior year, primarily related to the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2017, we incurred net interest expense of $131 million, an increase of $29 million from the prior year, primarily driven by the debt acquired on the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nIncome Tax\nIn 2017, our income tax expense decreased by $27 million, from $173 million in 2016 to $146 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a benefit of $32 million related to recent U.S. tax reform and a decline in profit. In addition, since we are a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes, any tax benefits associated with U.S. losses are recognized by our members and not reflected in our tax expense.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe, in the conduct of all of our activities, are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical and quality standards (Standards) as also reported in our Quality Management System (QMS). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. To ensure that we live up to our high Standards, we devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (Compliance Program) which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond in a timely fashion to any potential violations of law, our Code of Conduct (The Spirit & The Letter), and other BHGE policies and procedures.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 32\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n \u2022 Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations connected to government officials; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are country-specific guidance for customs standards, visa processing, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions and antiboycott laws. \n \u2022 Global structure of Legal Compliance Counsel and Professionals providing compliance advice, customized training, investigations, and governance, across all regions and countries where we do business. \n \u2022 Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis. \n \u2022 Due diligence procedures for commercial sales agents, administrative service providers, and professional consultants, and an enhanced risk-based process for classifying channel partners and suppliers. \n \u2022 Due diligence procedures for merger and acquisition activities. \n \u2022 Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments focused on country and third party risk. \n \u2022 Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as Product Company and regional compliance committees that meet quarterly. \n \u2022 Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a web-based antiboycott reporting tool and global trade management systems. \n \u2022 A compliance program designed to create an Open Reporting Environment\u201d where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in 150 languages. \n \u2022 Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies. \n \u2022 Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries conducted by Legal Compliance and Internal Audit, as well as risk based compliance audits of third parties conducted by Legal Compliance. \n \u2022 A centralized human resources function, including locally compliant processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including implementation of locally compliant standards for pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion to select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire compliance training module for all employees. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. At December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $3,677 million compared to $7,026 million at December 31, 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash includes $747 million and $997 million of cash held on behalf of GE at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nExcluding cash held on behalf of GE, our US subsidiaries held approximately $0.7 billion and $3.6 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2018 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., we may be required to provide taxes on certain of those funds, however, due to\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 33\nthe enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.\nWe have a five-year $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with commercial banks maturing in July 2022. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, certain affirmative covenants and no negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement, and other customary defaults. We were in compliance with all of the credit facility's covenants, and in 2018 there were no borrowings under the credit facility.\nWe have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time up to $3 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. At December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program. The maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the 2017 Credit Agreement and the commercial paper program is $3 billion.\nIf market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs and restructuring costs, capital expenditures, the repayment of debt, repurchase of our Units and distribution to members. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(798\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(472\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(4,381\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to product or services sales including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,738 million and used cash of $798 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased $2,536 million in 2018 primarily driven by better operating performance. These cash inflows were supported by strong working capital cash flows, especially in the fourth quarter of 2018, including approximately $300 million for a progress collection payment from a customer. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2018 and 2017 are payments of $473 million and $612 million, respectively, made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and merger and related costs.\nCash flows from operating activities used $798 million and generated $262 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1,061 million in 2017 primarily driven by a $1,201 million negative impact from ending our receivables monetization program in the fourth quarter, and restructuring related payments throughout the year. These cash outflows were partially offset by strong working capital cash flows, especially in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in our cash flows from operating\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 34\nactivities for 2017 and 2016 are payments of $612 million and $177 million, respectively, made for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and merger and related costs.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $578 million, $4,123 million and $472 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $995 million, $665 million and $424 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $458 million, $172 million and $20 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lost-in-hole, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period. In 2018, the Company received $453 million from the sale of businesses primarily driven by the sale of its Natural Gas Solution (NGS) business for $375 million. Also in 2018, the Company and ADNOC signed a strategic partnership agreement under which the Company acquired a five percent stake in ADNOC Drilling for a cash consideration of $500 million.\nIn 2017, cash flows from investing activities also includes $7,498 million of distribution to BHGE to fund the special dividend paid by BHGE to former Baker Hughes stockholders on the acquisition of Baker Hughes, net of $4,133 million of cash received from the acquisition.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities used cash of $4,381 million, generated cash of $10,914 million and used cash of $102 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring 2018, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to our members through repurchase of our Units and distributions to members. Specifically, we used cash of $1 billion to repurchase our Units from our members on a pro rata basis. Additionally, in November 2018, we repurchased 65 million Units from GE for a cash consideration of $1,461 million. As of December 31, 2018, the stock repurchase program has been substantially completed. During 2018, we made a distribution to our members of $824 million.\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $376 million and $663 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Repayment of our long-term debt in 2018 consisted primarily of repayment of certain Senior Notes and capital leases for a total consideration of $684 million.\nIn 2017, our primary source of financing cash flows was a contribution of $7,400 million from GE to fund substantially all of the distribution made to BHGE for the special dividend paid to former Baker Hughes stockholders. We also generated financing cash flows of $3,950 million from debt issued through a private placement offering in December 2017. We incurred issuance costs of $26 million related to this debt issuance.\nIn December 2017, we purchased $176 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount associated with our long-term outstanding notes and debentures. Pursuant to a cash tender offer, the purchases resulted in the payment of an early-tender premium, including various fees of $28 million.\nAdditionally, in 2017, we made a distribution of $406 million to our members and used $477 million of cash to repurchase our Units from our members, including GE, on a pro rata basis. The repurchases in 2017 did not result in a change of GE's approximate 62.5% interest in us.\nCash flows from financing activities in 2017 also included net transfers from GE of $1,498 million primarily driven by the cash pooling activity with GE prior to the Transactions. Other financing items during the year included a payment of $193 million to complete the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in the Pipeline Inspection and Integrity business within Digital Solutions.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 35\nCash Requirements\nIn 2019, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and distribution to members, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. In light of the current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2019 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $425 million to $475 million in 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>3,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including capital lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any deferred issuance costs or unamortized discounts or premiums including step up in the value of the debt on the acquisition of Baker Hughes. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. Total debt and capital lease obligations includes $896 million payable to GE and its affiliates. As there is no fixed payment schedule on the amount payable to GE and its affiliates we have classified it as payable in less than one year. \n (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. \n (3) Amounts represent the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more. We enter into operating leases, some of which include renewal options, however, we have excluded renewal options from the table above unless it is anticipated that we will exercise such renewals. \n (4) Purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2019 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. \nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $597 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See \"Note 12. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. and international employees. During 2018, we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately $72 million in connection with those plans, and we anticipate funding approximately $41 million during 2019. Amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change, therefore, we are currently not\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 36\nable to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2019. See \"Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2018. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases, as discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nRegistration Statements: In November 2018, BHGE filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2021.\nIn December 2017, we and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to have the ability to sell up to $3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2020.\nCustomer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2018, 24% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States. Other than the United States, no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at this date. As of December 31, 2017, 20% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States.\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S., is 81% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2018. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 37\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Many of these estimates include determining fair value. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and longlived assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated and combined financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our TPS segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of 15 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates.\nRevenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review.\nThe difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract liability (billings in excess of revenue). See \"Note 8. Contract and other deferred assets\" and \"Note 9. Progress collections and deferred income\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 38\nthrough supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $26 million, $44 million and $113 million for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident.\nOn December 31, 2018, our long-term product service agreements, net of related billings in excess of revenues of $0.4 billion represent approximately 4.3% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $10.3 billion. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion and $0.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 16% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1% would increase or decrease the long-term product service agreements balance by $0.04 billion.\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually using data as of July 1 of that year. The impairment test consists of two different steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value, in step two, which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. We determine fair values of each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed.\nPension Assumptions\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits, lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 3.43%, 2.99% and 3.41%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates. Our expected return on assets at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 5.94%, 6.26% and 6.86%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the U.S. GAAP in these various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. However, as a result of U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our prior unrepatriated foreign earnings were subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without incremental U.S. federal tax. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we changed our intent regarding certain cash repatriations and have accrued an additional $9 million of foreign withholding taxes. As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative amount of indefinitely\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 39\nreinvested foreign earnings is approximately $6.3 billion. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform) that lowers the statutory tax rate on U.S. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from U.S. taxation at a reduced rate of tax (transition tax), establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations.\nThe impact of U.S. tax reform was initially recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provided for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax. Based on guidance received to date, finalization of purchase accounting for the Baker Hughes acquisition and finalization of our 2017 U.S. income tax returns, we have recorded a $25 million tax expense in 2018.\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\" payments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). We have made an accounting policy election to account for these taxes as period costs.\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $472 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2018. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.\nThe preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $327 million and $330 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions, however, uncertainties\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 40\nregarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, inventory reserves totaled $430 million and $360 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nAcquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nSee \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of accounting standards to be adopted.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSee \"Note 16. Related Party Transactions\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of related party transactions.\nOTHER ITEMS\nBrexit\nIn June 2016, UK voters approved the UK's exit (Brexit) from the EU. The UK is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU scheduled for March 29, 2019. There remains significant uncertainty as to whether the withdrawal agreement between the UK government and the EU will be approved, when, if and on what terms Brexit will happen. There is a range of outcomes possible, from no Brexit to an abrupt cut-off of the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. The above withdrawal agreement contemplates a transition period from March 2019 through December 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed.\nAlthough our customer base is global with predominant exposure to the U.S. dollar, we have a manufacturing and service base in the UK with some euro procurement, thus we are exposed to fluctuations in value of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar, euro and other currencies. We have a hedging program which looks to accommodate this potential volatility.\nIran Threat Reduction And Syria Human Rights Act Of 2012\nThe Company is making the following disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, enacted in 2012, we are required to disclose in\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 41\nour periodic reports if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in business activities relating to Iran, even if those activities are conducted in accordance with authorizations subsequently issued by the U.S. Government. Reportable activities include investments that significantly enhance Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources valued at $20 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period. Reporting is also required for transactions related to Iran's domestic production of refined petroleum products or Iran's ability to import refined petroleum products valued at $5 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period.\nIn January 2016, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License H authorizing U.S.-owned or controlled foreign entities to engage in transactions with Iran if these entities meet the requirements of the general license. On May 8, 2018, President Trump announced that the United States will cease participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and begin re-imposing the U.S. nuclear-related sanctions. On June 27, 2018, OFAC revoked General License H and added Section 560.537 to the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR), which authorized all transactions and activities that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the winding down of activities previously approved under General License H through November 4, 2018. Prior to May 8, 2018, certain non-U.S. BHGE affiliates conducted limited activities as described below, in accordance with General License H. As of November 5, 2018, non-U.S. BHGE affiliates, have concluded all activity previously conducted under General License H in Iran. These activities were conducted in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2018, but prior to the expiration of the wind down period for General License H, non-U.S. BHGE affiliates conducted the following reportable activities:\n \u2022 A non-U.S. affiliate of BHGE received five purchase orders and attributed \u20ac31.4 million ($36.0 million) in gross revenues and \u20ac8.6 million ($9.9 million) in net profits related to the sale of valves and parts for industrial machinery and equipment used in gas plants, petrochemical plants and gas production projects in Iran. \n \u2022 A second non-U.S. affiliate of BHGE received 12 purchase orders and attributed \u20ac0.1 million ($0.1 million) in gross revenues and less than \u20ac0.1 million ($0.1 million) in net profits to the sale of valves and other spare parts for use in the petrochemical industry in Iran. \n \u2022 A third non-U.S. affiliate of BHGE attributed \u20ac0.3 million ($0.3 million) in gross revenues and \u20ac0.1 million ($0.1 million) in net profits to transactions involving the sale of films used in the inspection of pipelines in Iran.  These non-U.S. affiliates do not intend to continue the activities described above. The Company has ended all of these activities in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and at this time does not intend to seek specific U.S. Government authorization to collect revenues associated with previously reported projects.\nFor additional information on business activities related to Iran, please refer to the Other Items section within MD&A in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 42\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K, including MD&A and certain statements in the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a \"forward-looking statement\").

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed the Transactions to combine GE O&G and Baker Hughes, creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated oilfield products, services and digital solutions. The Transactions were executed using a partnership structure, pursuant to which GE O&G and Baker Hughes each contributed their operating assets to the Company. As of December 31, 2018, GE holds an approximate 50.4% interest in us and BHGE holds an approximate 49.6% interest. GE's interest is held through a voting interest of Class B Common Stock in BHGE and its economic interest through a corresponding number of our common units. The results of operations for the Company include the results of Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017, the date of acquisition, through December 31, 2018. The majority of the Baker Hughes business operations are included in the Oilfield Services segment. The Transactions were treated as a reverse acquisition\u201d for accounting purposes and, as such, the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer, GE O&G, are the historical financial statements of the Company. The current year results may not be comparable to prior years as the prior years include the results of Baker Hughes only from July 3, 2017. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Processing Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS). As of December 31, 2018, BHGE LLC employs approximately 66,000 employees and operates in more than 120 countries.\nIn June 2018, GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from BHGE over time. To that end, during the fourth quarter of 2018, certain equity transactions were completed and GE's ownership of BHGE was reduced from approximately 62.5% to approximately 50.4%. At the same time, we completed the Master Agreement Framework designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaboration between us and GE and to position us for the future. The Master Agreement Framework focuses on areas where we work most closely with GE on developing leading technology and executing for customers. First, we defined the parameters for long-term collaboration and partnership with GE on critical rotating equipment technology. Second, for our Digital software and technology business we will maintain the status quo as the exclusive supplier of GE Digital oil-and-gas applications. Finally, we reached agreements on a number of other areas including our Controls business, pension, taxes, and intercompany services. For further details on the Master Agreement Framework see \"Note 16. Related Party Disclosures\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nIn aggregate, we anticipate that the net financial impact of the agreements contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework will have a slightly negative impact on our operating margin rates of approximately 20 to 40 basis points. In addition, we expect to incur one-time charges related to separation from GE of approximately $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over the next three years. We expect these charges to be primarily related to the build-out of information technology infrastructure as well as customary transaction fees. For a discussion of certain risks associated with separation, including risks related to our business, financial condition and results of operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Factors Related to the Transactions and Separation from GE.\u201d\nIn 2018, we generated revenue of $22,877 million, compared to $17,179 million in 2017. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by OFS as 2018 included the full year results of Baker Hughes compared to only six months in 2017, and to a lesser extent, by DS partially offset by declines in TPS and OFE. Income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $680 million in 2018, and included restructuring and impairment charges of $433 million and merger and related costs of $153 million. These restructuring and impairment charges were recorded as a result of our continued actions to adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced activity levels. In 2017, loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $335 million, which also included restructuring and impairment charges of $412 million, and merger and related costs of $373 million.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 24\nOUTLOOK\nOur business is exposed to a number of different macro factors, which influence our expectations and outlook. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today, and are subject to change given volatile conditions in the industry.\n \u2022 North America onshore activity: in 2018, we experienced an acceleration in rig count growth, as compared to 2017, driven by the increase in commodity prices for the first 10 months of the year. In the fourth quarter, WTI prices declined 38% driven by both increased supply and geo-political events. We expect the decline in commodity prices may have a negative impact on activity in North America in 2019. \n \u2022 International onshore activity: we have seen a moderate increase in rig count activity in 2018 and expect growth to continue into 2019, at a slightly increased rate. We have seen signs of improvement with the increase in commodity prices, but due to continued volatility, we remain cautious as to growth expectations. \n \u2022 Offshore projects: although commodity prices have been volatile, we have begun to see increasing customer activity on offshore projects and more final investment decisions being made. Subsea tree awards increased in 2018, and we expect tree awards to be roughly flat in 2019, though still at levels significantly below prior 2012 and 2013 peaks. We expect customers to continue to evaluate the timing of final investment decisions, and in light of increased commodity price volatility, there may be some project delays. \n \u2022 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects: we remain optimistic on the LNG market. While currently oversupplied, we believe a significant number of final investment decisions are needed to fill the projected supply-demand imbalance in the early to middle part of the next decade. In 2018, we saw positive final investment decisions for new LNG capacity. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive given our outlook for supply and demand. \n \u2022 Refinery, petrochemical and industrial projects: in refining, we believe large, complex refineries should gain advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape in 2019 as the industry globalizes and refiners position to meet local demand and secure export potential. In petrochemicals, we continue to see healthy demand and cost-advantaged supply driving projects forward in 2019. The industrial market continues to grow as outdated infrastructure is replaced, policy changes come into effect and power is decentralized. We continue to see growing demand across these markets in 2019.  We have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with different industrial metrics such as our Digital Solutions business. Overall, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the value chain, and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the industry, but are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing assumptions in the near term.\nSolar and wind net additions continued to exceed coal and gas throughout 2018. Governments may change or may not continue incentives for renewable energy additions. In the long term, renewables' cost decline may accelerate to compete with new-built fossil capacity. However, we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future.\nDespite the near-term volatility, the long-term outlook for our industry remains positive. We believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity, requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technology from oilfield service companies. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, cost-efficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 25\nshould be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes of the Company.\nWe operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Energy Information Administration (EIA) Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel \n (2) EIA Cushing, OK WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price \n (3) EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit  2018 demonstrated the volatility of the oil and gas market. Through the first three quarters of 2018, we experienced stability in the North American and international markets. However, in the fourth quarter of 2018 commodity prices dropped nearly 40% resulting in increased customer uncertainty. From an offshore standpoint, through most of 2018, we saw multiple large offshore projects reach positive final investment decisions, and the LNG market and outlook improved throughout 2018, driven by increased demand globally. In 2018, the first large North American LNG positive final investment decision was reached.\nOutside of North America, customer spending is highly driven by Brent oil prices, which increased on average throughout the year. Average Brent oil prices increased to $71.34/Bbl in 2018 from $54.12/Bbl in 2017, and ranged from a low of $50.57/Bbl in December 2018, to a high of $86.07/Bbl in October 2018. For the first three quarters of 2018, Brent oil prices increased sequentially. However, in the fourth quarter, Brent oil prices declined 39% versus the end of the third quarter, as a result of increased supply from the U.S., worries of a global economic slowdown, and lower than expected production cuts.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similar to Brent oil prices, on average increased throughout the year. Average WTI oil prices increased to $65.23/Bbl in 2018 from $50.80/Bbl in 2017, and ranged from a low of $44.48/Bbl in December 2018, to a high of $77.41/Bbl in June 2018.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $3.15/mmBtu in 2018, representing a 6% increase over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $6.24/mmBtu in January 2018 to a low of $2.49/mmBtu in February 2018. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2018 was 2,705 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which was 15.6%, or 421 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2017.\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 26\nstrength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\n\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOverall the rig count was 2,211 in 2018, an increase of 9% as compared to 2017 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America increased 13% in 2018 compared to 2017. Internationally, the rig count increased 4% in 2018 as compared to the same period last year.\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was up 18% on average versus 2017, partially offset with a decrease in the Canadian rig count, which was down 8% on average. Internationally, the improvement in the rig count was driven primarily by increases in the Africa region of 18%, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America region, were also up by 9% and 3%, respectively, partially offset by the Europe region, which was down 8%.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOverall the rig count was 2,030 in 2017, an increase of 27% as compared to 2016 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America increased 69% in 2017 compared to 2016. Internationally, the rig count decreased 1% in 2017 as compared to the same period last year.\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the land rig count, which was up 72%, partially offset by a decrease in the offshore rig count of 16%. Internationally, the rig count decrease was driven primarily by decreases in Latin America of 7%, the Europe region and Africa region, which were down by 4% and 2%, respectively, partially offset by the Asia-Pacific region, which was up 8%.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 27\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nThe results of operations for the Company include the results of Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017, the date of acquisition, through the year ended December 31, 2018. Our results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level.\nThe performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following: net interest expense, net other non operating income, corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, inventory impairment, merger and related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:\nVolume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (FX): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the US dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation & benefits and overhead costs.\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume & price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nOrders: We recognized orders of $23,904 million, $17,159 million, and $11,066 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, service orders were up 36% and equipment orders were up 45%, compared to 2017. In 2017, service orders were up 39% and equipment orders were up 88%, compared to 2016. The increase in orders in 2018 and 2017 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $21.0 billion in each year, respectively.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 28\nRevenue and Segment Operating Income (Loss) Before Tax\nRevenue and segment operating income (loss) for each of our four operating segments is provided below. \n\n (1) Inventory impairments and related charges are reported in the \"Cost of goods sold\" caption of the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss). 2017 includes $87 million of adjustments to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value on acquisition of Baker Hughes as this inventory was used or sold in the six months ended December 31, 2017.  Fiscal Year 2018 to Fiscal Year 2017\nRevenue in 2018 was $22,877 million, an increase of $5,698 million, or 33%, from 2017. This increase in revenue was largely a result of the incremental Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. OFS increased $5,736 million, DS increased $262 million, OFE decreased $20 million, and TPS decreased $280 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2018 was $1,796 million, an increase of $681 million, or 61%, from 2017. The increase was primarily driven by OFS, which increased $718 million, and DS, which increased $33 million, partially offset by TPS, which decreased $44 million, and OFE, which decreased $26 million.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 29\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2018 revenue was $11,617 million, an increase of $5,736 million from 2017, primarily as a result of having the full year of Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. In addition to the incremental revenue from Baker Hughes, the improvement in revenue was also due to increased activity in the North American and international markets compared to the prior year as evidenced by the 9% increase in the worldwide rig counts.\nOFS 2018 segment operating income was $785 million, compared to $67 million in 2017. The additional contribution resulting from the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and to a lesser extent higher activity and synergy benefits, drove the increase in operating income.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2018 revenue was $2,641 million, a decrease of $20 million, or 1%, from 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volume in the flexible pipe business. Additionally, the decrease was driven by lower opening RPO in the subsea production systems business, partially offset with higher volume in the surface pressure control and services businesses.\nOFE 2018 segment operating income was breakeven, compared to $26 million in 2017. This decline in profitability was primarily driven by a negative mix of long-term projects, and to a lesser extent foreign exchange headwinds. Deflation savings and positive cost productivity only partially offset the decrease.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2018 revenue was $6,015 million, a decrease of $280 million, or 4%, from 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the businesses that serve the upstream segments, and to a lesser extent by lower volume in the businesses that serve the downstream segments. Equipment revenue in 2018 represented 40% and Service revenue represented 60% of total revenue.\nTPS 2018 segment operating income was $621 million, compared to $665 million in 2017. The decline in profitability was driven primarily by lower volume, and to a lesser extent by negative cost productivity. The decrease was partially offset by a favorable business mix and cost reduction actions implemented by the Company.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2018 revenue was $2,604 million, an increase of $262 million, or 11%, from 2017, primarily as a result of the incremental Baker Hughes revenue in 2018. Outside of this contribution, a decrease in the controls business due to softness in the power end-market was more than offset by revenue increases across all other product lines.\nDS 2018 segment operating income was $390 million, compared to $357 million in 2017. The increase in profitability was driven by positive cost productivity, including synergy benefits.\nCorporate\nIn 2018, corporate expenses were $405 million, an increase of $35 million compared to 2017, primarily from the additional expenses related to the acquisition of Baker Hughes partially offset by realized synergies.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2018, we recognized $433 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, an increase of $21 million compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to costs driven by the implementation of our synergy plans.\nMerger and Related Costs\nWe recorded $153 million of merger and related costs in 2018, a decrease of $220 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in costs as we finalize our merger related activities partially offset by costs incurred in relation to the anticipated separation from GE.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 30\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2018, we incurred net interest expense of $223 million, an increase of $92 million from the prior year, primarily driven by $3.95 billion of debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 and debt obtained in the Baker Hughes acquisition, partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with the retirement of debt of $615 million in January of 2018. In addition, interest expense declined as we ceased participation in the GE receivables monetization program.\nEquity in Loss of Affiliate\nIn 2018, we recorded a loss of $139 million related to our equity method investment in BJ Services. As a result, we discontinued applying the equity method. We will resume application of the equity method only after our share of unrecognized net income equals our share of net loss not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. There is no cash impact to BHGE.\nIncome Tax\nIn 2018, our income tax expense increased by $256 million, from $146 million in 2017 to $402 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher foreign taxes related to increased foreign earnings and geographical mix of earnings. In addition, since we are a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes, any tax benefits associated with U.S. losses are recognized by our members and not reflected in our tax expense.\nFiscal Year 2017 to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenue in 2017 was $17,179 million, an increase of $4,097 million, or 31%, from 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Baker Hughes. OFS increased $5,093 million, DS increased $256 million, OFE decreased $879 million, and TPS decreased $373 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2017 was $1,115 million, a decrease of $404 million, or 27%, from 2016. The acquisition of Baker Hughes added $321 million of segment operating income, but was more than offset by the organic impact of lower productivity and pricing pressure. OFS increased $274 million, TPS decreased $393 million, OFE decreased $279 million and DS decreased $6 million.\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2017 revenue was $5,881 million, an increase of $5,093 million from 2016, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Baker Hughes on July 3, 2017.\nOFS 2017 segment operating income was $67 million, compared to a loss of $207 million in 2016. The acquisition of Baker Hughes added $327 million of segment operating income, which includes increased depreciation & amortization expense driven by purchase accounting, partially offset by pricing pressure.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2017 revenue was $2,661 million, a decrease of $879 million, or 25%, from 2016. The revenue decline was primarily due to continued volume pressures and to a lesser extent to negative pricing, driven by the delays in final investment decisions by our customers in prior years.\nOFE 2017 segment operating income was $26 million, compared to $305 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was the result of negative productivity and volume, while strong deflation savings more than offset pricing pressures.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2017 revenue was $6,295 million, a decrease of $373 million, or 6%, from 2016. The decline was primarily attributable to negative pricing and to a lesser extent to volume decreases, driven by lower equipment contracts being awarded in prior years and continued softness in the services market.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 31\nTPS 2017 segment operating income was $665 million, compared to $1,058 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was primarily due to unfavorable cost productivity. Other factors were lower margin equipment backlog throughput and the impact of negative pricing.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2017 revenue was $2,342 million, an increase of $256 million, or 12%, from 2016, driven by the acquisition of Baker Hughes which added $211 million of revenue versus the prior year.\nDS 2017 segment operating income was $357 million, compared to $363 million in 2016. This decline in profitability was primarily driven by the Baker Hughes acquisition contributing a $5 million segment operating loss.\nCorporate\nIn 2017, corporate expenses were $370 million, a decrease of $5 million compared to 2016. This was primarily due to selective decreases in R&D program investments and cost productivity.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2017, we recognized $412 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, a decrease of $104 million compared to 2016. This decrease was driven by the absence of any significant currency devaluations in Angola and Nigeria that were experienced in 2016.\nMerger and Related Costs\nWe recorded $373 million of merger and related costs in 2017, an increase of $340 million from the prior year, primarily related to the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2017, we incurred net interest expense of $131 million, an increase of $29 million from the prior year, primarily driven by the debt acquired on the acquisition of Baker Hughes.\nIncome Tax\nIn 2017, our income tax expense decreased by $27 million, from $173 million in 2016 to $146 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a benefit of $32 million related to recent U.S. tax reform and a decline in profit. In addition, since we are a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes, any tax benefits associated with U.S. losses are recognized by our members and not reflected in our tax expense.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe, in the conduct of all of our activities, are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical and quality standards (Standards) as also reported in our Quality Management System (QMS). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. To ensure that we live up to our high Standards, we devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (Compliance Program) which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond in a timely fashion to any potential violations of law, our Code of Conduct (The Spirit & The Letter), and other BHGE policies and procedures.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 32\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n \u2022 Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations connected to government officials; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are country-specific guidance for customs standards, visa processing, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions and antiboycott laws. \n \u2022 Global structure of Legal Compliance Counsel and Professionals providing compliance advice, customized training, investigations, and governance, across all regions and countries where we do business. \n \u2022 Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis. \n \u2022 Due diligence procedures for commercial sales agents, administrative service providers, and professional consultants, and an enhanced risk-based process for classifying channel partners and suppliers. \n \u2022 Due diligence procedures for merger and acquisition activities. \n \u2022 Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments focused on country and third party risk. \n \u2022 Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as Product Company and regional compliance committees that meet quarterly. \n \u2022 Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a web-based antiboycott reporting tool and global trade management systems. \n \u2022 A compliance program designed to create an Open Reporting Environment\u201d where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in 150 languages. \n \u2022 Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies. \n \u2022 Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries conducted by Legal Compliance and Internal Audit, as well as risk based compliance audits of third parties conducted by Legal Compliance. \n \u2022 A centralized human resources function, including locally compliant processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including implementation of locally compliant standards for pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion to select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire compliance training module for all employees. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. At December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $3,677 million compared to $7,026 million at December 31, 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash includes $747 million and $997 million of cash held on behalf of GE at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nExcluding cash held on behalf of GE, our US subsidiaries held approximately $0.7 billion and $3.6 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2018 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., we may be required to provide taxes on certain of those funds, however, due to\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 33\nthe enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.\nWe have a five-year $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with commercial banks maturing in July 2022. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, certain affirmative covenants and no negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement, and other customary defaults. We were in compliance with all of the credit facility's covenants, and in 2018 there were no borrowings under the credit facility.\nWe have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time up to $3 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. At December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program. The maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the 2017 Credit Agreement and the commercial paper program is $3 billion.\nIf market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we used cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs and restructuring costs, capital expenditures, the repayment of debt, repurchase of our Units and distribution to members. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to product or services sales including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,738 million and used cash of $798 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased $2,536 million in 2018 primarily driven by better operating performance. These cash inflows were supported by strong working capital cash flows, especially in the fourth quarter of 2018, including approximately $300 million for a progress collection payment from a customer. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2018 and 2017 are payments of $473 million and $612 million, respectively, made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and merger and related costs.\nCash flows from operating activities used $798 million and generated $262 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1,061 million in 2017 primarily driven by a $1,201 million negative impact from ending our receivables monetization program in the fourth quarter, and restructuring related payments throughout the year. These cash outflows were partially offset by strong working capital cash flows, especially in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in our cash flows from operating\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 34\nactivities for 2017 and 2016 are payments of $612 million and $177 million, respectively, made for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and merger and related costs.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $578 million, $4,123 million and $472 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $995 million, $665 million and $424 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $458 million, $172 million and $20 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lost-in-hole, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period. In 2018, the Company received $453 million from the sale of businesses primarily driven by the sale of its Natural Gas Solution (NGS) business for $375 million. Also in 2018, the Company and ADNOC signed a strategic partnership agreement under which the Company acquired a five percent stake in ADNOC Drilling for a cash consideration of $500 million.\nIn 2017, cash flows from investing activities also includes $7,498 million of distribution to BHGE to fund the special dividend paid by BHGE to former Baker Hughes stockholders on the acquisition of Baker Hughes, net of $4,133 million of cash received from the acquisition.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities used cash of $4,381 million, generated cash of $10,914 million and used cash of $102 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring 2018, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to our members through repurchase of our Units and distributions to members. Specifically, we used cash of $1 billion to repurchase our Units from our members on a pro rata basis. Additionally, in November 2018, we repurchased 65 million Units from GE for a cash consideration of $1,461 million. As of December 31, 2018, the stock repurchase program has been substantially completed. During 2018, we made a distribution to our members of $824 million.\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $376 million and $663 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Repayment of our long-term debt in 2018 consisted primarily of repayment of certain Senior Notes and capital leases for a total consideration of $684 million.\nIn 2017, our primary source of financing cash flows was a contribution of $7,400 million from GE to fund substantially all of the distribution made to BHGE for the special dividend paid to former Baker Hughes stockholders. We also generated financing cash flows of $3,950 million from debt issued through a private placement offering in December 2017. We incurred issuance costs of $26 million related to this debt issuance.\nIn December 2017, we purchased $176 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount associated with our long-term outstanding notes and debentures. Pursuant to a cash tender offer, the purchases resulted in the payment of an early-tender premium, including various fees of $28 million.\nAdditionally, in 2017, we made a distribution of $406 million to our members and used $477 million of cash to repurchase our Units from our members, including GE, on a pro rata basis. The repurchases in 2017 did not result in a change of GE's approximate 62.5% interest in us.\nCash flows from financing activities in 2017 also included net transfers from GE of $1,498 million primarily driven by the cash pooling activity with GE prior to the Transactions. Other financing items during the year included a payment of $193 million to complete the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in the Pipeline Inspection and Integrity business within Digital Solutions.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 35\nCash Requirements\nIn 2019, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and distribution to members, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. In light of the current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2019 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $425 million to $475 million in 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\n\n (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including capital lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any deferred issuance costs or unamortized discounts or premiums including step up in the value of the debt on the acquisition of Baker Hughes. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. Total debt and capital lease obligations includes $896 million payable to GE and its affiliates. As there is no fixed payment schedule on the amount payable to GE and its affiliates we have classified it as payable in less than one year. \n (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. \n (3) Amounts represent the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more. We enter into operating leases, some of which include renewal options, however, we have excluded renewal options from the table above unless it is anticipated that we will exercise such renewals. \n (4) Purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2019 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. \nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $597 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See \"Note 12. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. and international employees. During 2018, we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately $72 million in connection with those plans, and we anticipate funding approximately $41 million during 2019. Amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change, therefore, we are currently not\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 36\nable to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2019. See \"Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2018. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases, as discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nRegistration Statements: In November 2018, BHGE filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2021.\nIn December 2017, we and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to have the ability to sell up to $3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2020.\nCustomer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2018, 24% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States. Other than the United States, no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at this date. As of December 31, 2017, 20% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States.\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S., is 81% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2018. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 37\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Many of these estimates include determining fair value. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and longlived assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated and combined financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our TPS segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of 15 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates.\nRevenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review.\nThe difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract liability (billings in excess of revenue). See \"Note 8. Contract and other deferred assets\" and \"Note 9. Progress collections and deferred income\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 38\nthrough supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $26 million, $44 million and $113 million for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident.\nOn December 31, 2018, our long-term product service agreements, net of related billings in excess of revenues of $0.4 billion represent approximately 4.3% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $10.3 billion. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion and $0.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 16% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1% would increase or decrease the long-term product service agreements balance by $0.04 billion.\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually using data as of July 1 of that year. The impairment test consists of two different steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value, in step two, which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. We determine fair values of each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed.\nPension Assumptions\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits, lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 3.43%, 2.99% and 3.41%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates. Our expected return on assets at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 5.94%, 6.26% and 6.86%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the U.S. GAAP in these various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. However, as a result of U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our prior unrepatriated foreign earnings were subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without incremental U.S. federal tax. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we changed our intent regarding certain cash repatriations and have accrued an additional $9 million of foreign withholding taxes. As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative amount of indefinitely\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 39\nreinvested foreign earnings is approximately $6.3 billion. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform) that lowers the statutory tax rate on U.S. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from U.S. taxation at a reduced rate of tax (transition tax), establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations.\nThe impact of U.S. tax reform was initially recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provided for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax. Based on guidance received to date, finalization of purchase accounting for the Baker Hughes acquisition and finalization of our 2017 U.S. income tax returns, we have recorded a $25 million tax expense in 2018.\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\" payments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). We have made an accounting policy election to account for these taxes as period costs.\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $472 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2018. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.\nThe preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $327 million and $330 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions, however, uncertainties\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 40\nregarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, inventory reserves totaled $430 million and $360 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nAcquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nSee \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of accounting standards to be adopted.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSee \"Note 16. Related Party Transactions\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of related party transactions.\nOTHER ITEMS\nBrexit\nIn June 2016, UK voters approved the UK's exit (Brexit) from the EU. The UK is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU scheduled for March 29, 2019. There remains significant uncertainty as to whether the withdrawal agreement between the UK government and the EU will be approved, when, if and on what terms Brexit will happen. There is a range of outcomes possible, from no Brexit to an abrupt cut-off of the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. The above withdrawal agreement contemplates a transition period from March 2019 through December 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed.\nAlthough our customer base is global with predominant exposure to the U.S. dollar, we have a manufacturing and service base in the UK with some euro procurement, thus we are exposed to fluctuations in value of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar, euro and other currencies. We have a hedging program which looks to accommodate this potential volatility.\nIran Threat Reduction And Syria Human Rights Act Of 2012\nThe Company is making the following disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, enacted in 2012, we are required to disclose in\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 41\nour periodic reports if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in business activities relating to Iran, even if those activities are conducted in accordance with authorizations subsequently issued by the U.S. Government. Reportable activities include investments that significantly enhance Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources valued at $20 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period. Reporting is also required for transactions related to Iran's domestic production of refined petroleum products or Iran's ability to import refined petroleum products valued at $5 million or more in the aggregate during a twelve-month period.\nIn January 2016, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License H authorizing U.S.-owned or controlled foreign entities to engage in transactions with Iran if these entities meet the requirements of the general license. On May 8, 2018, President Trump announced that the United States will cease participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and begin re-imposing the U.S. nuclear-related sanctions. On June 27, 2018, OFAC revoked General License H and added Section 560.537 to the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR), which authorized all transactions and activities that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the winding down of activities previously approved under General License H through November 4, 2018. Prior to May 8, 2018, certain non-U.S. BHGE affiliates conducted limited activities as described below, in accordance with General License H. As of November 5, 2018, non-U.S. BHGE affiliates, have concluded all activity previously conducted under General License H in Iran. These activities were conducted in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2018, but prior to the expiration of the wind down period for General License H, non-U.S. BHGE affiliates conducted the following reportable activities:\n \u2022 A non-U.S. affiliate of BHGE received five purchase orders and attributed \u20ac31.4 million ($36.0 million) in gross revenues and \u20ac8.6 million ($9.9 million) in net profits related to the sale of valves and parts for industrial machinery and equipment used in gas plants, petrochemical plants and gas production projects in Iran. \n \u2022 A second non-U.S. affiliate of BHGE received 12 purchase orders and attributed \u20ac0.1 million ($0.1 million) in gross revenues and less than \u20ac0.1 million ($0.1 million) in net profits to the sale of valves and other spare parts for use in the petrochemical industry in Iran. \n \u2022 A third non-U.S. affiliate of BHGE attributed \u20ac0.3 million ($0.3 million) in gross revenues and \u20ac0.1 million ($0.1 million) in net profits to transactions involving the sale of films used in the inspection of pipelines in Iran.  These non-U.S. affiliates do not intend to continue the activities described above. The Company has ended all of these activities in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and at this time does not intend to seek specific U.S. Government authorization to collect revenues associated with previously reported projects.\nFor additional information on business activities related to Iran, please refer to the Other Items section within MD&A in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.\nBHGE LLC 2018 FORM 10-K | 42\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K, including MD&A and certain statements in the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a \"forward-looking statement\").

revenue was $22.9 billion in 2018, up 33% from 2017, primarily driven by the full year impact of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Oilfield Services was the largest segment at $11.6 billion revenue. Net income was $139 million compared to a loss of $492 million in 2017.\n\n- North American revenue grew due to higher rig count and activity levels. International revenue also grew moderately. Offshore projects saw some positive momentum.\n\n- In June 2018, GE announced intent to pursue an orderly separation from BHGE over time. As a result, BHGE entered agreements with GE in areas like technology collaboration, pensions, taxes, etc. Separation costs are estimated at $0.2-0.3 billion over next 3 years. \n\n- Cash from operations was $1.7 billion in 2018 versus a use of $0.8 billion in 2017, driven by better operating performance and working capital flows. BHGE invested $1 billion in share repurchases and paid distributions of $0.8 billion.\n\n- Outlook for 2019 is cautious on North American onshore activity if oil prices stay volatile. International onshore is expected to see moderate growth. Offshore projects could see some delays depending on commodity prices.\n\n- The report also discusses critical accounting estimates related to revenue recognition on long-term service agreements, goodwill impairment, pension assumptions, income taxes, loss contingencies, and other items."}
