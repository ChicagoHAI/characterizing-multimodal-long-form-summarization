MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including information about possible or assumed results of our financial condition, operations, plans, objectives and performance that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated and set forth in such\nforward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and potential commercialization of its product candidate, leronlimab (PRO 140), which is being studied for the treatment of HIV infection, NASH, oncology and other immunological indications. Our current business strategy is to seek the removal of the partial and full clinical holds recently imposed by the US FDA in March 2022, evaluate feasibility and timelines for the resubmission of our BLA for leronlimab as a combination therapy for highly treatment-experienced HIV patients, and to seek to further develop leronlimab for other HIV-related indications. We also seek to advance our clinical development of leronlimab for various forms of cancer, including metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( mTNBC\u201d) and other solid tumors, as well as to continue to evaluate NAFLD and NASH, and concurrently to explore other potential immunologic indications for leronlimab.\nAs further discussed in Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Inventories, Note 3, Inventories, net, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, the Company capitalized procured or produced pre-launch inventories in preparation for product launches. The Company considers anticipated future sales, shelf-lives, and expected approval date when evaluating realizability of pre-launch inventories. The shelf-life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory, the Company considers the stability data of all inventories. As inventories approach their shelf-life expiration, the Company may perform additional stability testing to determine if the inventory is still viable, which may result in an extension of its shelf-life. Further, in addition to performing additional stability testing, certain raw materials inventory may be sold in its then current condition prior to reaching expiration. In determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable, the Company considers a number of factors, including potential delays in obtaining regulatory approval, the introduction of competing products that may negatively impact the demand for our product, the likelihood that physicians would be willing to prescribe leronlimab to their patients, and whether the target patient population would be willing to try leronlimab as a new therapy.\nFiscal 2022 Overview\nFiscal 2022 was a transitional year for the Company which included:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Notification that the FDA had placed our HIV and COVID-19 programs on partial and full clinical holds, respectively; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Successfully avoiding an attempted proxy contest seeking to replace the Company's Board of Directors; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Strengthening the Company's Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board through the addition of highly-qualified and experienced members; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Leadership transitions including the termination of the Company's former President and CEO in January 2022 and the hiring of a biotech veteran as its new President in July 2022; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Completion of COVID-19 Long-Haulers, NASH, and oncology studies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Entering into a research agreement with a leading US cancer research institution; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Resubmission of two of the three sections of the HIV BLA; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Acceptance of five articles into various scientific journals; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Strengthening our pharmacovigilance program, in part in response to the clinical holds placed on the Company by the FDA; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Settlement of an ongoing legal disputes with the Company's former CMO and the 2020 shareholder derivative suit; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Completion of a number of private offerings to continue to fund the Company's progress. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical and corporate development highlights are provided below.\nHIV BLA and Clinical Developments\nThe remaining BLA section to be completed and submitted remains in progress as of the date of this report. The Company is in a dispute with its former contract research organization ( CRO\u201d); the Company obtained an order requiring the CRO to release the Company's clinical data related to the BLA, which the CRO had been withholding, thereby preventing the Company from completing necessary clinical data submissions to the FDA. The order granted the Company access to the data and the right to perform an audit of the CRO's services. In March 2022, the FDA notified the Company that it had placed a partial clinical hold on the Company's HIV program; the Company was not enrolling any new patients in the trials placed on hold. The partial clinical hold on the HIV program impacted patients currently enrolled in HIV extension trials. The affected patients have been transitioned to other available therapeutics. No clinical studies can be initiated or resumed until the partial clinical hold is resolved, which may affect our ability to resubmit the BLA. The Company's efforts are focused on activities that will allow us to resolve the partial clinical hold and resume the BLA resubmission process. The Company will update the status of its anticipated resubmission of the clinical section of the BLA once it determines a date for resubmission.\nEarlier in fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In June 2021, an animal study was published in Nature Communications regarding the use of leronlimab for HIV PrEP. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In July 2021, the Company submitted its dose justification draft report to the FDA in connection with the resubmission of its BLA. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In August 2021, the Company received guidance from the FDA with regard to its previously submitted HIV BLA draft dose justification report. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In October 2021, the FDA accepted a revised rolling review timeline for resubmitting the BLA, allowing for contemporaneous review by the FDA for sections as they are submitted. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In November 2021, the Company resubmitted two of the three integral sections of the BLA for review by the FDA, the non-clinical and manufacturing sections. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNASH Clinical Developments\nThere is currently no approved drug for NASH, and liver disease is one of the leading causes of non-AIDS-related death in HIV patients. The Company is identifying the next steps in clinical development and is exploring potential business opportunities to continue the investigation of leronlimab in the NASH indication and HIV patients with NASH. In October 2019, the FDA granted clearance to CytoDyn to proceed with a Phase 2 study to test whether leronlimab may control the effects of liver fibrosis associated with NASH. This trial was converted to an exploratory trial with an open label 350mg arm. The first patient was enrolled in December 2020. Leronlimab 700mg did not reduce mean change in PDFF and cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo and did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Leronlimab 350mg significantly reduced mean change in PDFF and cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo. Despite increased fibro-inflammation, in patients with moderate and severe cT1 values at baseline, leronlimab 350mg showed significantly reduced cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo.\nCancer Clinical Developments\nDuring 2021, the Company reported results from mTNBC patients who had failed at least two lines of previous therapy in the Compassionate Use program, our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, and our Basket trial. The data were insufficient to support resubmission of a Breakthrough Therapy designation request without additional data. The Company is identifying the next steps in clinical development and potential business opportunities to continue the development of this indication, including potentially facilitating research in leronlimab's role in oncology at various academic institutions.\nEarlier in fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In July 2021, the Company's Phase 1b clinical trial for mTNBC advanced to Phase 2 of the trial. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In August 2021, the Company's final mTNBC report indicated an increase in 12-month overall survival and 12-month modified progression-free survival in certain patients. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In October 2021, the Company signed a research agreement with a leading cancer research institution, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, to evaluate the potential synergistic therapeutic efficacy of leronlimab in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In January 2022, the FDA notified the Company that its mTNBC data did not demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing mTNBC therapies in the limited number of patients provided; therefore, it could not grant Breakthrough Therapy designation. The FDA indicated that the Company may submit a new request with additional clinical evidence that demonstrates a substantial improvement in second-line treatment of mTNBC over existing therapies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOVID-19 Clinical Developments\nIn March 2022, the FDA notified the Company it had placed a full clinical hold on the Company's COVID-19 program. The Company was not conducting any COVID-19 trials in the United States at the time the hold was placed, and elected to voluntarily withdraw the respective IND. The Company will need to resolve the clinical hold and submit another IND before initiating any future COVID-19 trials in the United States. Further, the Company had elected to pause its Brazil COVID-19 trials pending results from its previously scheduled data safety monitoring board ( DSMB\u201d) meeting in early April 2022. In April 2022, the DSMB for the Brazilian COVID-19 clinical trials met and recommended that the Brazilian COVID-19 trials, previously paused by the Company, may continue based on the review of the interim patient safety data from the clinical trials. The Company is in the process of considering strategic alternatives prior to commencing the enrollment of new patients in the Brazilian trials.\nEarlier in the year, the Company completed the following:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In June 2021, the Company received its first purchase order from Chiral Pharma Corporation ( Chiral\u201d) to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Philippines under a Compassionate Special Permit ( CSP\u201d). This order was fulfilled in August 2021. In September 2021, the Company received two additional purchase orders from Chiral in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.2 million to continue to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Philippines under a CSP. These orders were shipped during the quarter ended November 30, 2021. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In July 2021, the Company was granted a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for methods of treating COVID-19. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>In August 2021, the Company received clearance from Brazil's ANVISA to commence its Phase 3 trial for severe COVID-19 patients. The trial was conducted in up to 35 clinical sites with 612 patients. The first patient was treated in this trial in September 2021. Also in September 2021, the Company received clearance from Brazil's ANVISA to commence its pivotal Phase 3 trial in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The first patient was treated in this trial in October 2021. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Developments\nIn January 2022, the Board of Directors terminated the employment of Nader Z. Pourhassan, Ph.D. as President and CEO of the Company; he is also no longer a member of the Board of Directors. A committee of three Board members was appointed to initiate the search for a new CEO culminating in the appointment of Cyrus Arman, Ph.D., MBA as President effective July 9, 2022. Antonio Migliarese, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, was appointed interim President and served in that role until July 9, 2022.\nDuring February 2022, the Board of Directors approved the continued appointments to the Scientific Advisory Board ( SAB\u201d) of Dr. Hope Rugo (oncology), Dr. Mazen Noureddin (hepatology), Dr. Jonah Sacha (HIV), Dr. Norman Gaylis (rheumatology), and Dr. Eric Mininberg (oncology), as well as new SAB members Dr. Otto Yang (infectious diseases/immunology), Dr. Kabir Mody (oncology), Dr. Paul Edison (neuroscience/neuroinflammation), and Dr. Gero Hutter (hematology, oncology and transfusion medicine).\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors appointed Karen J. Brunke, Ph.D. as a director of the Company. Dr. Brunke has over 30 years of scientific, operational, clinical, senior executive, and corporate development experience with large and small biotechnology companies.\nResults of operations for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nThe Company's operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on the outcomes of clinical trials, patient enrollment and/or completion rates in clinical trials, entering into new clinical trial protocols, and their related effect on research and development expenses, regulatory and compliance activities, activities related to preparation and resubmission of the HIV BLA, general and administrative expenses, professional fees, and legal proceedings and the related outcomes. As a predominantly non-revenue generating company, we require a significant amount of additional capital to continue to operate; therefore, we regularly conduct offerings to raise capital, which can create various forms of non-cash interest expense or expense related to amortization of issuance costs. Additionally, we periodically negotiate settlement of debt payment obligations in exchange for equity securities of the Company, and enter into private warrant exchanges which may create a non-cash charge upon extinguishment of debt and/or inducement expense. Our ability to continue to fund operations will depend on our ability to raise additional capital. Refer to Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Going Concern sections below.\nThe results of operations were as follows for the periods

Financial Statements, and Note 14, Restatement.\nProduct revenue, Cost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) and Gross margin\nWe recognized revenue of approximately $266.4 thousand and cost of goods sold of approximately $52.8 thousand in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022; none in fiscal year 2021. Revenue was related to the fulfillment of orders under a Compassionate Special Permit ( CSP\u201d) in the Philippines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Sales were made under the April 2021 exclusive supply and distribution agreement granting Chiral the right to distribute and sell up to 200,000 vials of leronlimab through April 15, 2022. At the time of the sales, FDA approval had not yet been received for\nleronlimab and the product sold was previously expensed as research and development expense due to its being manufactured prior to the commencement of the manufacturing of commercial grade pre-launch inventories. Therefore, COGS consists only of the costs of packaging and shipping of the vials, including related customs and duties.

The increase in G&A expenses over the 2021 fiscal year was primarily due to legal and consulting fees and increased insurance premiums, offset by decreases in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. The increase in legal fees was related to the proxy contest and related lawsuits, SEC and DOJ investigations, the Pestell employment dispute, and the Amarex dispute.\nG&A expenses totaled approximately $34.3 million and $20.0 million during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively, representing an increase of approximately $14.3 million, or 72% over the preceding fiscal year. The increase in G&A expenses over the 2020 fiscal year was primarily due to employee compensation and related expenses, increased non-cash stock-based compensation, and higher professional services fees.\nResearch and development expenses\nR&D expenses consisted of the following:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended May 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022/2021 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021/2020 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 20,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (16,381)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-clinical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,215)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (798)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CMC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,542)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,855)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and patent fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (222)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 53,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 52,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (26,360)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D expenses totaled approximately $27.0 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $26.4 million, or 49%, compared to the preceding fiscal year. The decrease year over year was primarily due to lower clinical trial expenses resulting from clinical trials predominantly being administered and completed in prior year related to US COVID-19, oncology, and NASH, the pausing of the Brazilian COVID-19 trials, and the closing of HIV extension studies due to clinical holds placed on the Company by the FDA. The future trend of R&D expenses is dependent on the timing of BLA resubmission and the FDA approval, if any, the timing of FDA clearance from clinical hold, if any, of our pivotal trial protocol for leronlimab as a monotherapy for HIV patients, the future clinical development of oncology and NASH indications, the outcome of pre-clinical studies for several other cancer indications, and potential outcomes of the Brazilian COVID-19 trials. Additionally, the Company concluded the majority of its CMC activities related to the HIV BLA during fiscal 2021, thus resulting in a significant expense decrease in fiscal 2022 as compared to the preceding year.\nR&D expenses totaled approximately $53.4 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $0.8 million, or 1%, over the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The 2021 increase over 2020 was primarily\nattributable to higher clinical trial expenses, partially offset by decreases in non-clinical and CMC expenses. The increase in clinical trial costs were attributable to clinical trials related to COVID-19, oncology and immunology indications.\nAmortization and depreciation expenses and Intangible asset impairment charge\nAmortization and depreciation expense totaled approximately $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $1.0 million, or 57% from the preceding year. The decrease was attributable to the intangible write-off of a proprietary algorithm intangible asset during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 and the ProstaGene noncompete intangible asset becoming fully amortized as of November 30, 2021, resulting in decreased amortization expense of intangibles.\nAmortization and depreciation expense totaled approximately $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million, or 12% from the prior year. The decrease was attributable to the intangible write-off of a proprietary algorithm intangible asset, resulting in decreased amortization of intangibles.\nFor the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022 and 2020, the Company recorded no intangible asset impairment charges. The charge recorded in fiscal year 2021 was attributable to the impairment of the net carrying value of the proprietary algorithm the Company acquired in connection with the acquisition of the assets of ProstaGene, LLC in November 2018, and which was recorded as intangible asset in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nInventory write-off\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the anticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote-off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022.\nThe Company recorded an inventory write-off based on its expected expiration dates of $5.0 million in fiscal 2021.

For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we recognized non-cash losses on the induced conversion of convertible notes with common stock of approximately $37.4 million, a decrease of approximately $1.8 million, or 4%, from the preceding fiscal year. The losses resulted from separately and independently negotiated exchange agreements to satisfy certain note payment obligations in which certain debt was agreed to be settled in exchange for shares issued at a price less than the closing price for the effective date of the respective transactions. Inducement interest expense related to warrant inducements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, totaled $6.7 million, a decrease of approximately $7.2 million, or 52%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. During fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the Company entered into fewer warrant inducement transactions as compared to the preceding year, resulting in a decreased inducement expense. During fiscal year 2022, the Company issued a total of 10.2 million shares of common stock, including additional shares as an inducement for warrant holders to exercise warrants; by comparison the Company issued a total of 36.2 million shares in connection with private warrant exchanges in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021.\nDuring the year, we also recorded $2.4 million of estimated finance charges related to open amounts due to Samsung. Additionally, we recorded approximately $6.6 million of non-cash finance charges related to 15 million warrants issued under a surety bond backstop agreement as a finance charge in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 7, Equity Awards, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Commitments with Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd. ( Samsung\u201d), respectively, of this Form 10-K for additional information. There were no comparable expenses in the preceding fiscal year. We also recorded $3.9 million of legal settlement charges related to settlement of a dispute with a placement agent and settlement of the Pestell employment dispute. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\nInterest and other expense totaled approximately $71.9 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $6.6 million, or 10%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The increase mainly relates to an increase in loss on the induced conversion of convertible notes, offset by decreases in change in fair value of derivative liabilities, legal settlement expense, and inducement interest. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, we did not realize a change in fair value of derivative liabilities as compared to the prior year, as the originating instruments were all exercised and settled during the 2020 fiscal year. The originating underlying instruments were certain warrants that originated in September 2016 and two convertible note instruments originated in June 2018 and January 2019 containing contingent cash settlement provisions, which gave rise to a derivative liability. For each reporting period, the Company determined the fair value of the derivative liability and recorded a corresponding non-cash benefit or non-cash charge, due to a decrease or increase, respectively, in the calculated derivative liability.\nLegal settlements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, of $10.6 million related to cash damages awarded to plaintiffs in legal proceedings against the Company. Legal settlements (non-cash) for the fiscal year ended May 31,\n2020, of $22.5 million related to the issuance of shares of common stock in settlement of a claim filed by the holder of the January 2019 note alleging that the note holder was owed additional shares upon conversion of the note.\nInducement interest expense related to warrant inducements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, totaled $13.9 million, a decrease of approximately $9.5 million, or 41%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. During fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the Company entered into fewer warrant inducement transactions as compared to the preceding year, resulting in decreased inducement expense. During fiscal year 2021, the Company issued a total of approximately 35.8 million shares of common stock, and approximately 0.4 million additional shares as an inducement for warrant holders to exercise warrants, for a total of approximately 36.2 million shares related to warrant inducements. In fiscal year 2020, the Company issued a total of 65.9 million shares in connection with private warrant exchanges. During fiscal year 2022, the Company identified an error in how non-cash inducement interest expense was calculated in previous reporting periods dating back to fiscal year 2018, resulting in a revision of previously reported inducement interest expense amounts. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revision of Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for the discussion.\nDuring the preparation and audit of the annual financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, the Company concluded that a material error was identified in how the Company was accounting for common stock issued to settle certain convertible note obligations dating back to fiscal year 2021. The Company had been accounting for these transactions in accordance with debt extinguishment accounting. However, although the contractual terms did not explicitly describe the transactions as induced conversions, the transactions should be accounted for as induced conversions rather than extinguishments of debt and are therefore subject to induced conversion accounting. The error resulted in an understatement of the previously reported non-cash loss on induced conversions and additional paid-in capital. The errors had no impact on operating loss, cash, net cash used in or provided by operating, financing, and investing activities, assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies, total stockholders' (deficit) equity, number of shares issued and outstanding, basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, and number of shares available for future issuance for any of the affected periods. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 14, Restatement for additional information. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, we recognized non-cash losses on the induced conversion of convertible notes of approximately $39.1 million. We did not recognize any non-cash losses on induced conversion of convertible notes in fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The losses resulted from separately and independently negotiated exchange agreements to satisfy certain note payment obligations in which certain debt was agreed to be settled in exchange for shares issued at a price less than the closing price for the effective date of the respective transactions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of May 31, 2022, we had a total of approximately $4.2 million in cash and approximately $123.2 million in short-term liabilities consisting primarily of approximately $42.2 million representing the current portion and accrued interest of convertible notes payable and approximately $76.8 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and compensation. We will continue to incur operating losses and the Company will require a significant amount of additional capital in the future as we continue to seek approval to commercialize leronlimab. Despite the Company's negative working capital position, vendor relations remain accommodative and we do not currently anticipate significant delays in our business initiatives schedule due to liquidity constraints. We cannot be certain, however, that future funding will be available to us when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such agreements are deemed favorable to both parties under then current circumstances and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs.\nCash\nThe Company's cash position of approximately $4.2 million at May 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $29.7 million compared to the balance of approximately $33.9 million at May 31, 2021. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we funded our operations by obtaining a total of approximately $48.0 million of net cash proceeds primarily funded through the sales of common stock and warrants.\nSummary of cash flows and changes between the periods presented is as follows:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended May 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022/2021 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021/2020 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (77,723)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (117,573)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (68,804)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 39,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (48,769)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (122)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (41)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (81)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 48,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 137,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 79,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (89,335)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 57,676\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cash used in operating activities decreased by approximately $39.9 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 primarily due to changes in our net loss, working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all of which are highly variable. Cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $117.6 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, which reflects an increase of approximately $48.8 million over the approximately $68.8 million in fiscal year 2020. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was due to increased pre-launch inventories, and net loss, offset in part by the intangible asset impairment charge, increased accounts payables and accrued liabilities, and increased non-cash loss on induced conversion of debt, when compared to the changes in the prior year.\nCash used in investing activities did not change significantly between the fiscal years.\nCash provided by financing activities decreased by approximately $89.3 million which was primarily attributable to decreased funding in fiscal 2022 through convertible debt and decreased proceeds from warrant exercises, offset by proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants during the fiscal year 2022. Cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $137.3 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 representing an approximate $57.7 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in net cash provided from financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from convertible debt issuances and an increase in proceeds from warrant inducement transactions.\nPre-launch inventories\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the anticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote-off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 3, Inventories, net for additional information.\nConvertible debt\nApril 2, 2021 Note. On April 2, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of $28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $25.0 million, after $3.4 million of debt discount and $0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10% per annum, contains a stated conversion price of $10.00 per share, and matures in April 2023. The April 2, 2021 Note required monthly debt reduction payments of $7.5 million for the six\nmonths beginning in May 2021, which could also be satisfied by payments on other notes held by the noteholder or its affiliates. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to $3.5 million. As of May 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was $11.9 million.\nApril 23, 2021 Note. On April 23, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of $28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $25.0 million, after $3.4 million of debt discount and $0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10% per annum, contains a stated conversion price of $10.00 per share, and matures in April 2023. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to $7.0 million. As of May 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the April 23, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was $30.3 million.\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Convertible Instruments and Accrued Interest of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nCommon stock\nWe have 1,000.0 million authorized shares of common stock. The table below summarizes intended uses of common stock.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuable upon:\n</td> <td>May 31, 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrants exercise\n</td> <td>88.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible preferred stock and undeclared dividends conversion\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding stock options exercise or vesting of outstanding RSUs\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserved for issuance pursuant to future stock-based awards under equity incentive plan\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserved and issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible notes\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserved for private placement of common stock and warrants through placement agent\n</td> <td>60.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shares reserved for future uses\n</td> <td>215.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stock outstanding\n</td> <td>719.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As a result, as of May 31, 2022, we had approximately 65.4 million unreserved authorized shares of common stock available for issuance. Our ability to continue to fund our operations depends on our ability to raise capital. The funding necessary for our operations may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we deplete our cash reserves, we may have to discontinue our operations and liquidate our assets, in extreme cases, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, discontinue operations or liquidate assets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of May 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nRefer to Note 6, Convertible Instruments and Accrued Interest, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is a party to various legal proceedings described in Part II, Item 8, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K. The Company recognizes accruals for such proceedings to the extent a loss is determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The best estimate of a loss within a possible range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is more probable than another, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If it is determined that a material loss is not probable but reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the possible loss is disclosed.\nIt is not possible to determine the outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain,\nand the outcomes could differ significantly from recognized accruals. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, or if an accrual had not been made, could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for further discussion of legal proceedings.\nRegulatory Matters\nFDA Refusal to File Letter re HIV BLA Submission\nIn July 2020, the Company received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its BLA submission for leronlimab as a combination therapy with HAART for highly treatment-experienced HIV patients. The FDA informed the Company the BLA did not contain certain information and data needed to complete a substantive review and therefore, the FDA would not file the BLA. The deficiencies cited by FDA included administrative deficiencies, omissions, corrections to data presentation and related analyses, and clarifications regarding the manufacturing processes. The Company is working with consultants to cure the BLA deficiencies noted and will resubmit the BLA as soon as practical. In November 2021, the Company resubmitted the non-clinical and CMC sections of the BLA and is currently reevaluating when it expects to complete the clinical section. As of March 2022, the FDA had commenced its review of the CMC section. The Company is in dispute with its former contract research organization ( CRO\u201d), as described in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings to this Form 10-K. Recently, in the context of the litigation, the Company obtained an order requiring the CRO to release the Company's clinical data related to the BLA, which the CRO had been withholding. Further, the order granted the Company the right to perform an audit of the CRO's services. Additionally, the FDA recently placed the HIV program on a partial clinical hold, which may affect the ability to resubmit the BLA. The Company is in the process of evaluating the data, results of the audit, and implications of the partial clinical hold. The Company will provide an updated strategy once it completes its evaluation, the impact those results may have on the BLA and an updated strategy timeline.\nFDA Warning Letter re COVID-19 Misbranding of Investigational Drug\nIn January 2022, the Company received a Warning Letter from the United States FDA alleging that its former CEO and President, Dr. Nader Pourhassan, had made references in a video interview to COVID-19 and leronlimab in a promotional context to the effect that leronlimab, an investigational new drug, is safe and effective for the purpose for which it is being investigated or otherwise promoted the drug. The FDA warned the Company that leronlimab has not been approved or authorized by the FDA, its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established, and that the related clinical trial data was mischaracterized in the video. The FDA further alleged the video misbrands leronlimab under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act and in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, as the claims in the video make representations in a promotional context regarding the safety and efficacy of an investigational new drug that has not been approved or authorized by the FDA. The Company is working closely with the FDA to resolve this matter and take the proper corrective actions.\nFDA Partial Clinical Hold re HIV and Full Clinical Hold re COVID-19 Letters\nIn March 2022, the United States FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Company's HIV program and a full clinical hold on its COVID-19 program in the United States. The Company was not enrolling any new patients in the trials placed on hold in the United States. The partial clinical hold on the HIV program impacts patients currently enrolled in extension trials. These patients have transitioned to other available therapeutics and no clinical studies can be initiated or resumed until the partial clinical hold is resolved. CytoDyn is working closely with the FDA to resolve the partial clinical hold as soon as possible. Under the full clinical hold on the COVID-19 program, no new clinical studies may be initiated until the clinical hold is resolved.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had losses for all periods presented. The Company incurred a net loss of $210.8 million for the year ended May 31, 2022 and has an accumulated deficit of $766.1 million as of May 31, 2022. As of May 31, 2022, these factors, among several others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the\nrecoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has had limited to no activities that produced revenue in the periods presented and has operated at a loss since inception. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain a significant amount of additional operating capital, to continue to fund operations and pay its liabilities and commitments, its research into multiple indications for and development of its product candidate, to obtain FDA approval of its product candidate for use in treating one or more indications, to outsource manufacturing of its product, and ultimately to attain profitability. We intend to seek additional funding through equity or debt offerings, licensing agreements, supply and distribution agreements, and strategic alliances to implement our business plan. There are no assurances, however, that we will be successful in these endeavors. If we are not able to raise capital on a timely basis on favorable terms, if at all, we may need to significantly change or scale back operations, including our efforts to complete the resubmission of our BLA and other development and commercialization initiatives or to adequately fund legal proceedings, all of which individually or in combination could materially impede our ability to achieve profitability. The Company's failure to raise additional capital could also affect our relationships with key vendors, including Samsung, disrupting our ability to timely execute our business plan. In extreme cases, the Company could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, discontinue operations or liquidate assets.\nSince inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from the public and private sale of equity securities as well as with proceeds from issuance of convertible notes and related party notes payable. The Company intends to finance its future operating activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity and debt securities. As of the date of this filing, the Company has approximately 65.4 million shares of common stock, authorized for issuance under its certificate of incorporation, as amended, and available for future uses. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities to raise additional capital is likely to result in dilution to stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of common shares. If the Company raises funds through the issuance of additional preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt or equity financing, the related transaction documents could contain covenants restricting its operations.\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into long-term convertible notes that are secured by all of our assets (excluding our intellectual property), and include certain restrictive provisions, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and future dilutive issuances of securities, any of which could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. In February 2022, in exchange for warrants, the Company entered into a backstop arrangement with an accredited investor whereby the Company pledged its patents and the investor agreed to indemnify the issuer of the surety bond in the Amarex dispute with respect to the Company's obligations under the surety bond. Future third-party funding arrangements may also require the Company to relinquish valuable rights. Additional capital, if available, may not be available on reasonable or non-dilutive terms.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements of this Form 10-K for the discussion.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expense and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management bases and evaluates estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following critical policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nWe capitalize inventories procured or produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically, capitalization of such inventory begins when the results of clinical trials have reached a status sufficient to support regulatory approval, uncertainties regarding ultimate regulatory approval have been significantly reduced and we have determined that it is probable that these capitalized costs will provide some future economic benefit in excess of capitalized costs. The material factors considered by the Company in evaluating these uncertainties include the receipt and analysis of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with the relevant regulatory authorities prior to the filing of regulatory applications, and the compilation of the regulatory application. We closely monitor the status of the product within the regulatory review and approval process, including all relevant communication with regulatory authorities. If we are aware of any specific material risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory review and approval process or if there are any specific issues identified relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory may no longer qualify for capitalization.\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Inventories currently consist of raw materials, bulk drug substance, and drug product in unlabeled vials to be used for commercialization of the Company's biologic, leronlimab, which is in the regulatory approval process. Inventory purchased in preparation for product launches is evaluated for recoverability by considering the likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory, in light of the status of the product within the regulatory approval process. The Company evaluates its inventory levels on a quarterly basis and writes down inventory that has become obsolete, or has a cost in excess of its expected net realizable value, and inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements. In assessing the lower of cost or net realizable value to pre-launch inventory, the Company relies on independent analysis provided by third parties knowledgeable of the range of likely commercial prices comparable to current comparable commercial product.\nFor inventories capitalized prior to FDA marketing approval in preparation of product launch, anticipated future sales, shelf-lives, and expected approval date are considered when evaluating realizability of pre-launch inventories. The shelf-life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory the Company considers the stability data of all inventories. As inventories approach their shelf-life expiration, the Company may perform additional stability testing to determine if the inventory is still viable, which can result in an extension of its shelf-life. Further, in addition to performing additional stability testing, certain raw materials inventory may be sold in its then current condition prior to reaching expiration. We also consider potential delays associated with regulatory approval in determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable. In determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable, the Company considers a number of factors ranging from potential delays associated with regulatory approval, whether the introduction of a competing product could negatively impact the demand for our product and affect the realizability of our inventories, whether physicians would be willing to prescribe leronlimab to their patients, or if the target patient population would be willing to try leronlimab as a new therapy.\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the\nanticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 3, Inventories, net for additional information.\nStock-based compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant utilizing certain assumptions that require judgments and estimates. These assumptions include estimates for stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates in determining the fair value of the equity awards. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the equity award. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock at monthly intervals. The computation of the expected option term is based on the simplified method,\u201d as the options issued by the Company are considered plain vanilla\u201d options. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise them, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on limited historical experience of forfeitures, we estimated future unvested forfeitures at 0% for all periods presented. Quarterly expense is reduced during the period when grants are forfeited, such that the full expense is recorded at the time of grant and only reduced when the grant is forfeited.\nWe at times issue restricted common stock and/or restricted stock units to executives or third parties as compensation for services rendered. Such awards are valued at fair market value on the effective date of the Company's obligation. From time to time, we also issue stock options and warrants to consultants as compensation for services. Costs for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more readily measurable.\nContingent liabilities\nWe have significant license and contingent milestone and royalty liabilities. We estimate the likelihood of paying these contingent liabilities periodically based on the progress of our clinical trials, BLA approval status, and status of commercialization. We are also party to various legal proceedings. We recognize accruals for such proceedings to the extent a loss is determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The best estimate of a loss within a possible range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is more probable than another, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If it is determined that a material loss is not probable but reasonably possible it is disclosed and if the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the possible loss is also disclosed. It is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the outcomes could differ significantly from recognized accruals. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, or if an accrual had not been made, could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of this Form 10-K for additional information.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including information about possible or assumed results of our financial condition, operations, plans, objectives and performance that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated and set forth in such\nforward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and potential commercialization of its product candidate, leronlimab (PRO 140), which is being studied for the treatment of HIV infection, NASH, oncology and other immunological indications. Our current business strategy is to seek the removal of the partial and full clinical holds recently imposed by the US FDA in March 2022, evaluate feasibility and timelines for the resubmission of our BLA for leronlimab as a combination therapy for highly treatment-experienced HIV patients, and to seek to further develop leronlimab for other HIV-related indications. We also seek to advance our clinical development of leronlimab for various forms of cancer, including metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( mTNBC\u201d) and other solid tumors, as well as to continue to evaluate NAFLD and NASH, and concurrently to explore other potential immunologic indications for leronlimab.\nAs further discussed in Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Inventories, Note 3, Inventories, net, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, the Company capitalized procured or produced pre-launch inventories in preparation for product launches. The Company considers anticipated future sales, shelf-lives, and expected approval date when evaluating realizability of pre-launch inventories. The shelf-life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory, the Company considers the stability data of all inventories. As inventories approach their shelf-life expiration, the Company may perform additional stability testing to determine if the inventory is still viable, which may result in an extension of its shelf-life. Further, in addition to performing additional stability testing, certain raw materials inventory may be sold in its then current condition prior to reaching expiration. In determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable, the Company considers a number of factors, including potential delays in obtaining regulatory approval, the introduction of competing products that may negatively impact the demand for our product, the likelihood that physicians would be willing to prescribe leronlimab to their patients, and whether the target patient population would be willing to try leronlimab as a new therapy.\nFiscal 2022 Overview\nFiscal 2022 was a transitional year for the Company which included:\n \u25cf Notification that the FDA had placed our HIV and COVID-19 programs on partial and full clinical holds, respectively; \n \u25cf Successfully avoiding an attempted proxy contest seeking to replace the Company's Board of Directors; \n \u25cf Strengthening the Company's Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board through the addition of highly-qualified and experienced members; \n \u25cf Leadership transitions including the termination of the Company's former President and CEO in January 2022 and the hiring of a biotech veteran as its new President in July 2022; \n \u25cf Completion of COVID-19 Long-Haulers, NASH, and oncology studies; \n \u25cf Entering into a research agreement with a leading US cancer research institution; \n \u25cf Resubmission of two of the three sections of the HIV BLA; \n \u25cf Acceptance of five articles into various scientific journals; \n \u25cf Strengthening our pharmacovigilance program, in part in response to the clinical holds placed on the Company by the FDA; \n \u25cf Settlement of an ongoing legal disputes with the Company's former CMO and the 2020 shareholder derivative suit; and \n \u25cf Completion of a number of private offerings to continue to fund the Company's progress. \nClinical and corporate development highlights are provided below.\nHIV BLA and Clinical Developments\nThe remaining BLA section to be completed and submitted remains in progress as of the date of this report. The Company is in a dispute with its former contract research organization ( CRO\u201d); the Company obtained an order requiring the CRO to release the Company's clinical data related to the BLA, which the CRO had been withholding, thereby preventing the Company from completing necessary clinical data submissions to the FDA. The order granted the Company access to the data and the right to perform an audit of the CRO's services. In March 2022, the FDA notified the Company that it had placed a partial clinical hold on the Company's HIV program; the Company was not enrolling any new patients in the trials placed on hold. The partial clinical hold on the HIV program impacted patients currently enrolled in HIV extension trials. The affected patients have been transitioned to other available therapeutics. No clinical studies can be initiated or resumed until the partial clinical hold is resolved, which may affect our ability to resubmit the BLA. The Company's efforts are focused on activities that will allow us to resolve the partial clinical hold and resume the BLA resubmission process. The Company will update the status of its anticipated resubmission of the clinical section of the BLA once it determines a date for resubmission.\nEarlier in fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following:\n \u25cf In June 2021, an animal study was published in Nature Communications regarding the use of leronlimab for HIV PrEP. \n \u25cf In July 2021, the Company submitted its dose justification draft report to the FDA in connection with the resubmission of its BLA. \n \u25cf In August 2021, the Company received guidance from the FDA with regard to its previously submitted HIV BLA draft dose justification report. \n \u25cf In October 2021, the FDA accepted a revised rolling review timeline for resubmitting the BLA, allowing for contemporaneous review by the FDA for sections as they are submitted. \n \u25cf In November 2021, the Company resubmitted two of the three integral sections of the BLA for review by the FDA, the non-clinical and manufacturing sections. \nNASH Clinical Developments\nThere is currently no approved drug for NASH, and liver disease is one of the leading causes of non-AIDS-related death in HIV patients. The Company is identifying the next steps in clinical development and is exploring potential business opportunities to continue the investigation of leronlimab in the NASH indication and HIV patients with NASH. In October 2019, the FDA granted clearance to CytoDyn to proceed with a Phase 2 study to test whether leronlimab may control the effects of liver fibrosis associated with NASH. This trial was converted to an exploratory trial with an open label 350mg arm. The first patient was enrolled in December 2020. Leronlimab 700mg did not reduce mean change in PDFF and cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo and did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Leronlimab 350mg significantly reduced mean change in PDFF and cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo. Despite increased fibro-inflammation, in patients with moderate and severe cT1 values at baseline, leronlimab 350mg showed significantly reduced cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo.\nCancer Clinical Developments\nDuring 2021, the Company reported results from mTNBC patients who had failed at least two lines of previous therapy in the Compassionate Use program, our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, and our Basket trial. The data were insufficient to support resubmission of a Breakthrough Therapy designation request without additional data. The Company is identifying the next steps in clinical development and potential business opportunities to continue the development of this indication, including potentially facilitating research in leronlimab's role in oncology at various academic institutions.\nEarlier in fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following:\n \u25cf In July 2021, the Company's Phase 1b clinical trial for mTNBC advanced to Phase 2 of the trial. \n \u25cf In August 2021, the Company's final mTNBC report indicated an increase in 12-month overall survival and 12-month modified progression-free survival in certain patients. \n \u25cf In October 2021, the Company signed a research agreement with a leading cancer research institution, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, to evaluate the potential synergistic therapeutic efficacy of leronlimab in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. \n \u25cf In January 2022, the FDA notified the Company that its mTNBC data did not demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing mTNBC therapies in the limited number of patients provided; therefore, it could not grant Breakthrough Therapy designation. The FDA indicated that the Company may submit a new request with additional clinical evidence that demonstrates a substantial improvement in second-line treatment of mTNBC over existing therapies. \nCOVID-19 Clinical Developments\nIn March 2022, the FDA notified the Company it had placed a full clinical hold on the Company's COVID-19 program. The Company was not conducting any COVID-19 trials in the United States at the time the hold was placed, and elected to voluntarily withdraw the respective IND. The Company will need to resolve the clinical hold and submit another IND before initiating any future COVID-19 trials in the United States. Further, the Company had elected to pause its Brazil COVID-19 trials pending results from its previously scheduled data safety monitoring board ( DSMB\u201d) meeting in early April 2022. In April 2022, the DSMB for the Brazilian COVID-19 clinical trials met and recommended that the Brazilian COVID-19 trials, previously paused by the Company, may continue based on the review of the interim patient safety data from the clinical trials. The Company is in the process of considering strategic alternatives prior to commencing the enrollment of new patients in the Brazilian trials.\nEarlier in the year, the Company completed the following:\n \u25cf In June 2021, the Company received its first purchase order from Chiral Pharma Corporation ( Chiral\u201d) to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Philippines under a Compassionate Special Permit ( CSP\u201d). This order was fulfilled in August 2021. In September 2021, the Company received two additional purchase orders from Chiral in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.2 million to continue to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Philippines under a CSP. These orders were shipped during the quarter ended November 30, 2021. \n \u25cf In July 2021, the Company was granted a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for methods of treating COVID-19. \n \u25cf In August 2021, the Company received clearance from Brazil's ANVISA to commence its Phase 3 trial for severe COVID-19 patients. The trial was conducted in up to 35 clinical sites with 612 patients. The first patient was treated in this trial in September 2021. Also in September 2021, the Company received clearance from Brazil's ANVISA to commence its pivotal Phase 3 trial in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The first patient was treated in this trial in October 2021. \nCorporate Developments\nIn January 2022, the Board of Directors terminated the employment of Nader Z. Pourhassan, Ph.D. as President and CEO of the Company; he is also no longer a member of the Board of Directors. A committee of three Board members was appointed to initiate the search for a new CEO culminating in the appointment of Cyrus Arman, Ph.D., MBA as President effective July 9, 2022. Antonio Migliarese, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, was appointed interim President and served in that role until July 9, 2022.\nDuring February 2022, the Board of Directors approved the continued appointments to the Scientific Advisory Board ( SAB\u201d) of Dr. Hope Rugo (oncology), Dr. Mazen Noureddin (hepatology), Dr. Jonah Sacha (HIV), Dr. Norman Gaylis (rheumatology), and Dr. Eric Mininberg (oncology), as well as new SAB members Dr. Otto Yang (infectious diseases/immunology), Dr. Kabir Mody (oncology), Dr. Paul Edison (neuroscience/neuroinflammation), and Dr. Gero Hutter (hematology, oncology and transfusion medicine).\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors appointed Karen J. Brunke, Ph.D. as a director of the Company. Dr. Brunke has over 30 years of scientific, operational, clinical, senior executive, and corporate development experience with large and small biotechnology companies.\nResults of operations for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nThe Company's operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on the outcomes of clinical trials, patient enrollment and/or completion rates in clinical trials, entering into new clinical trial protocols, and their related effect on research and development expenses, regulatory and compliance activities, activities related to preparation and resubmission of the HIV BLA, general and administrative expenses, professional fees, and legal proceedings and the related outcomes. As a predominantly non-revenue generating company, we require a significant amount of additional capital to continue to operate; therefore, we regularly conduct offerings to raise capital, which can create various forms of non-cash interest expense or expense related to amortization of issuance costs. Additionally, we periodically negotiate settlement of debt payment obligations in exchange for equity securities of the Company, and enter into private warrant exchanges which may create a non-cash charge upon extinguishment of debt and/or inducement expense. Our ability to continue to fund operations will depend on our ability to raise additional capital. Refer to Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Going Concern sections below.\nThe results of operations were as follows for the periods

Financial Statements, and Note 14, Restatement.\nProduct revenue, Cost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) and Gross margin\nWe recognized revenue of approximately $266.4 thousand and cost of goods sold of approximately $52.8 thousand in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022; none in fiscal year 2021. Revenue was related to the fulfillment of orders under a Compassionate Special Permit ( CSP\u201d) in the Philippines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Sales were made under the April 2021 exclusive supply and distribution agreement granting Chiral the right to distribute and sell up to 200,000 vials of leronlimab through April 15, 2022. At the time of the sales, FDA approval had not yet been received for\nleronlimab and the product sold was previously expensed as research and development expense due to its being manufactured prior to the commencement of the manufacturing of commercial grade pre-launch inventories. Therefore, COGS consists only of the costs of packaging and shipping of the vials, including related customs and duties. For additional information about revenue recognition and our inventories policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Revenue Recognition and Inventories to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K.\nThere were no revenues or cost of goods sold recognized in the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consisted of the following:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended May 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022/2021 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021/2020 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits, and other compensation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (6,825)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,166)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,314)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 34,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 19,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nG&A expenses totaled approximately $44.3 million and $34.3 million during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $10.0 million, or 29% over the previous fiscal year. The increase in G&A expenses over the 2021 fiscal year was primarily due to legal and consulting fees and increased insurance premiums, offset by decreases in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. The increase in legal fees was related to the proxy contest and related lawsuits, SEC and DOJ investigations, the Pestell employment dispute, and the Amarex dispute.\nG&A expenses totaled approximately $34.3 million and $20.0 million during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively, representing an increase of approximately $14.3 million, or 72% over the preceding fiscal year. The increase in G&A expenses over the 2020 fiscal year was primarily due to employee compensation and related expenses, increased non-cash stock-based compensation, and higher professional services fees.\nResearch and development expenses\nR&D expenses consisted of the following:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended May 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022/2021 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021/2020 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 20,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (16,381)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-clinical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,215)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (798)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CMC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,542)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,855)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and patent fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (222)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 53,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 52,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (26,360)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D expenses totaled approximately $27.0 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $26.4 million, or 49%, compared to the preceding fiscal year. The decrease year over year was primarily due to lower clinical trial expenses resulting from clinical trials predominantly being administered and completed in prior year related to US COVID-19, oncology, and NASH, the pausing of the Brazilian COVID-19 trials, and the closing of HIV extension studies due to clinical holds placed on the Company by the FDA. The future trend of R&D expenses is dependent on the timing of BLA resubmission and the FDA approval, if any, the timing of FDA clearance from clinical hold, if any, of our pivotal trial protocol for leronlimab as a monotherapy for HIV patients, the future clinical development of oncology and NASH indications, the outcome of pre-clinical studies for several other cancer indications, and potential outcomes of the Brazilian COVID-19 trials. Additionally, the Company concluded the majority of its CMC activities related to the HIV BLA during fiscal 2021, thus resulting in a significant expense decrease in fiscal 2022 as compared to the preceding year.\nR&D expenses totaled approximately $53.4 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $0.8 million, or 1%, over the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The 2021 increase over 2020 was primarily\nattributable to higher clinical trial expenses, partially offset by decreases in non-clinical and CMC expenses. The increase in clinical trial costs were attributable to clinical trials related to COVID-19, oncology and immunology indications.\nAmortization and depreciation expenses and Intangible asset impairment charge\nAmortization and depreciation expense totaled approximately $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $1.0 million, or 57% from the preceding year. The decrease was attributable to the intangible write-off of a proprietary algorithm intangible asset during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 and the ProstaGene noncompete intangible asset becoming fully amortized as of November 30, 2021, resulting in decreased amortization expense of intangibles.\nAmortization and depreciation expense totaled approximately $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million, or 12% from the prior year. The decrease was attributable to the intangible write-off of a proprietary algorithm intangible asset, resulting in decreased amortization of intangibles.\nFor the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022 and 2020, the Company recorded no intangible asset impairment charges. The charge recorded in fiscal year 2021 was attributable to the impairment of the net carrying value of the proprietary algorithm the Company acquired in connection with the acquisition of the assets of ProstaGene, LLC in November 2018, and which was recorded as intangible asset in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nInventory write-off\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the anticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote-off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022.\nThe Company recorded an inventory write-off based on its expected expiration dates of $5.0 million in fiscal 2021.

Interest and other expense totaled approximately $65.4 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $6.5 million, or 9%, from the preceding year. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we recognized non-cash losses on the induced conversion of convertible notes with common stock of approximately $37.4 million, a decrease of approximately $1.8 million, or 4%, from the preceding fiscal year. The losses resulted from separately and independently negotiated exchange agreements to satisfy certain note payment obligations in which certain debt was agreed to be settled in exchange for shares issued at a price less than the closing price for the effective date of the respective transactions. Inducement interest expense related to warrant inducements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, totaled $6.7 million, a decrease of approximately $7.2 million, or 52%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. During fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the Company entered into fewer warrant inducement transactions as compared to the preceding year, resulting in a decreased inducement expense. During fiscal year 2022, the Company issued a total of 10.2 million shares of common stock, including additional shares as an inducement for warrant holders to exercise warrants; by comparison the Company issued a total of 36.2 million shares in connection with private warrant exchanges in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021.\nDuring the year, we also recorded $2.4 million of estimated finance charges related to open amounts due to Samsung. Additionally, we recorded approximately $6.6 million of non-cash finance charges related to 15 million warrants issued under a surety bond backstop agreement as a finance charge in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 7, Equity Awards, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Commitments with Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd. ( Samsung\u201d), respectively, of this Form 10-K for additional information. There were no comparable expenses in the preceding fiscal year. We also recorded $3.9 million of legal settlement charges related to settlement of a dispute with a placement agent and settlement of the Pestell employment dispute. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\nInterest and other expense totaled approximately $71.9 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $6.6 million, or 10%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The increase mainly relates to an increase in loss on the induced conversion of convertible notes, offset by decreases in change in fair value of derivative liabilities, legal settlement expense, and inducement interest. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, we did not realize a change in fair value of derivative liabilities as compared to the prior year, as the originating instruments were all exercised and settled during the 2020 fiscal year. The originating underlying instruments were certain warrants that originated in September 2016 and two convertible note instruments originated in June 2018 and January 2019 containing contingent cash settlement provisions, which gave rise to a derivative liability. For each reporting period, the Company determined the fair value of the derivative liability and recorded a corresponding non-cash benefit or non-cash charge, due to a decrease or increase, respectively, in the calculated derivative liability.\nLegal settlements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, of $10.6 million related to cash damages awarded to plaintiffs in legal proceedings against the Company. Legal settlements (non-cash) for the fiscal year ended May 31,\n2020, of $22.5 million related to the issuance of shares of common stock in settlement of a claim filed by the holder of the January 2019 note alleging that the note holder was owed additional shares upon conversion of the note.\nInducement interest expense related to warrant inducements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, totaled $13.9 million, a decrease of approximately $9.5 million, or 41%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. During fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the Company entered into fewer warrant inducement transactions as compared to the preceding year, resulting in decreased inducement expense. During fiscal year 2021, the Company issued a total of approximately 35.8 million shares of common stock, and approximately 0.4 million additional shares as an inducement for warrant holders to exercise warrants, for a total of approximately 36.2 million shares related to warrant inducements. In fiscal year 2020, the Company issued a total of 65.9 million shares in connection with private warrant exchanges. During fiscal year 2022, the Company identified an error in how non-cash inducement interest expense was calculated in previous reporting periods dating back to fiscal year 2018, resulting in a revision of previously reported inducement interest expense amounts. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revision of Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for the discussion.\nDuring the preparation and audit of the annual financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, the Company concluded that a material error was identified in how the Company was accounting for common stock issued to settle certain convertible note obligations dating back to fiscal year 2021. The Company had been accounting for these transactions in accordance with debt extinguishment accounting. However, although the contractual terms did not explicitly describe the transactions as induced conversions, the transactions should be accounted for as induced conversions rather than extinguishments of debt and are therefore subject to induced conversion accounting. The error resulted in an understatement of the previously reported non-cash loss on induced conversions and additional paid-in capital. The errors had no impact on operating loss, cash, net cash used in or provided by operating, financing, and investing activities, assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies, total stockholders' (deficit) equity, number of shares issued and outstanding, basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, and number of shares available for future issuance for any of the affected periods. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 14, Restatement for additional information. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, we recognized non-cash losses on the induced conversion of convertible notes of approximately $39.1 million. We did not recognize any non-cash losses on induced conversion of convertible notes in fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The losses resulted from separately and independently negotiated exchange agreements to satisfy certain note payment obligations in which certain debt was agreed to be settled in exchange for shares issued at a price less than the closing price for the effective date of the respective transactions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of May 31, 2022, we had a total of approximately $4.2 million in cash and approximately $123.2 million in short-term liabilities consisting primarily of approximately $42.2 million representing the current portion and accrued interest of convertible notes payable and approximately $76.8 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and compensation. We will continue to incur operating losses and the Company will require a significant amount of additional capital in the future as we continue to seek approval to commercialize leronlimab. Despite the Company's negative working capital position, vendor relations remain accommodative and we do not currently anticipate significant delays in our business initiatives schedule due to liquidity constraints. We cannot be certain, however, that future funding will be available to us when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such agreements are deemed favorable to both parties under then current circumstances and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs.\nCash\nThe Company's cash position of approximately $4.2 million at May 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $29.7 million compared to the balance of approximately $33.9 million at May 31, 2021. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we funded our operations by obtaining a total of approximately $48.0 million of net cash proceeds primarily funded through the sales of common stock and warrants.\nSummary of cash flows and changes between the periods presented is as follows:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended May 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022/2021 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021/2020 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (77,723)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (117,573)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (68,804)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 39,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (48,769)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (122)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (41)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (81)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 48,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 137,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 79,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (89,335)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 57,676\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cash used in operating activities decreased by approximately $39.9 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 primarily due to changes in our net loss, working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all of which are highly variable. Cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $117.6 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, which reflects an increase of approximately $48.8 million over the approximately $68.8 million in fiscal year 2020. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was due to increased pre-launch inventories, and net loss, offset in part by the intangible asset impairment charge, increased accounts payables and accrued liabilities, and increased non-cash loss on induced conversion of debt, when compared to the changes in the prior year.\nCash used in investing activities did not change significantly between the fiscal years.\nCash provided by financing activities decreased by approximately $89.3 million which was primarily attributable to decreased funding in fiscal 2022 through convertible debt and decreased proceeds from warrant exercises, offset by proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants during the fiscal year 2022. Cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $137.3 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 representing an approximate $57.7 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in net cash provided from financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from convertible debt issuances and an increase in proceeds from warrant inducement transactions.\nPre-launch inventories\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the anticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote-off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 3, Inventories, net for additional information.\nConvertible debt\nApril 2, 2021 Note. On April 2, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of $28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $25.0 million, after $3.4 million of debt discount and $0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10% per annum, contains a stated conversion price of $10.00 per share, and matures in April 2023. The April 2, 2021 Note required monthly debt reduction payments of $7.5 million for the six\nmonths beginning in May 2021, which could also be satisfied by payments on other notes held by the noteholder or its affiliates. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to $3.5 million. As of May 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was $11.9 million.\nApril 23, 2021 Note. On April 23, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of $28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $25.0 million, after $3.4 million of debt discount and $0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10% per annum, contains a stated conversion price of $10.00 per share, and matures in April 2023. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to $7.0 million. As of May 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the April 23, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was $30.3 million.\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Convertible Instruments and Accrued Interest of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nCommon stock\nWe have 1,000.0 million authorized shares of common stock. The table below summarizes intended uses of common stock.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuable upon:\n</td> <td>May 31, 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrants exercise\n</td> <td>88.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible preferred stock and undeclared dividends conversion\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding stock options exercise or vesting of outstanding RSUs\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserved for issuance pursuant to future stock-based awards under equity incentive plan\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserved and issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible notes\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserved for private placement of common stock and warrants through placement agent\n</td> <td>60.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shares reserved for future uses\n</td> <td>215.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stock outstanding\n</td> <td>719.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As a result, as of May 31, 2022, we had approximately 65.4 million unreserved authorized shares of common stock available for issuance. Our ability to continue to fund our operations depends on our ability to raise capital. The funding necessary for our operations may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we deplete our cash reserves, we may have to discontinue our operations and liquidate our assets, in extreme cases, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, discontinue operations or liquidate assets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of May 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nRefer to Note 6, Convertible Instruments and Accrued Interest, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is a party to various legal proceedings described in Part II, Item 8, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K. The Company recognizes accruals for such proceedings to the extent a loss is determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The best estimate of a loss within a possible range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is more probable than another, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If it is determined that a material loss is not probable but reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the possible loss is disclosed.\nIt is not possible to determine the outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain,\nand the outcomes could differ significantly from recognized accruals. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, or if an accrual had not been made, could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for further discussion of legal proceedings.\nRegulatory Matters\nFDA Refusal to File Letter re HIV BLA Submission\nIn July 2020, the Company received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its BLA submission for leronlimab as a combination therapy with HAART for highly treatment-experienced HIV patients. The FDA informed the Company the BLA did not contain certain information and data needed to complete a substantive review and therefore, the FDA would not file the BLA. The deficiencies cited by FDA included administrative deficiencies, omissions, corrections to data presentation and related analyses, and clarifications regarding the manufacturing processes. The Company is working with consultants to cure the BLA deficiencies noted and will resubmit the BLA as soon as practical. In November 2021, the Company resubmitted the non-clinical and CMC sections of the BLA and is currently reevaluating when it expects to complete the clinical section. As of March 2022, the FDA had commenced its review of the CMC section. The Company is in dispute with its former contract research organization ( CRO\u201d), as described in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings to this Form 10-K. Recently, in the context of the litigation, the Company obtained an order requiring the CRO to release the Company's clinical data related to the BLA, which the CRO had been withholding. Further, the order granted the Company the right to perform an audit of the CRO's services. Additionally, the FDA recently placed the HIV program on a partial clinical hold, which may affect the ability to resubmit the BLA. The Company is in the process of evaluating the data, results of the audit, and implications of the partial clinical hold. The Company will provide an updated strategy once it completes its evaluation, the impact those results may have on the BLA and an updated strategy timeline.\nFDA Warning Letter re COVID-19 Misbranding of Investigational Drug\nIn January 2022, the Company received a Warning Letter from the United States FDA alleging that its former CEO and President, Dr. Nader Pourhassan, had made references in a video interview to COVID-19 and leronlimab in a promotional context to the effect that leronlimab, an investigational new drug, is safe and effective for the purpose for which it is being investigated or otherwise promoted the drug. The FDA warned the Company that leronlimab has not been approved or authorized by the FDA, its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established, and that the related clinical trial data was mischaracterized in the video. The FDA further alleged the video misbrands leronlimab under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act and in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, as the claims in the video make representations in a promotional context regarding the safety and efficacy of an investigational new drug that has not been approved or authorized by the FDA. The Company is working closely with the FDA to resolve this matter and take the proper corrective actions.\nFDA Partial Clinical Hold re HIV and Full Clinical Hold re COVID-19 Letters\nIn March 2022, the United States FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Company's HIV program and a full clinical hold on its COVID-19 program in the United States. The Company was not enrolling any new patients in the trials placed on hold in the United States. The partial clinical hold on the HIV program impacts patients currently enrolled in extension trials. These patients have transitioned to other available therapeutics and no clinical studies can be initiated or resumed until the partial clinical hold is resolved. CytoDyn is working closely with the FDA to resolve the partial clinical hold as soon as possible. Under the full clinical hold on the COVID-19 program, no new clinical studies may be initiated until the clinical hold is resolved.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had losses for all periods presented. The Company incurred a net loss of $210.8 million for the year ended May 31, 2022 and has an accumulated deficit of $766.1 million as of May 31, 2022. As of May 31, 2022, these factors, among several others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the\nrecoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has had limited to no activities that produced revenue in the periods presented and has operated at a loss since inception. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain a significant amount of additional operating capital, to continue to fund operations and pay its liabilities and commitments, its research into multiple indications for and development of its product candidate, to obtain FDA approval of its product candidate for use in treating one or more indications, to outsource manufacturing of its product, and ultimately to attain profitability. We intend to seek additional funding through equity or debt offerings, licensing agreements, supply and distribution agreements, and strategic alliances to implement our business plan. There are no assurances, however, that we will be successful in these endeavors. If we are not able to raise capital on a timely basis on favorable terms, if at all, we may need to significantly change or scale back operations, including our efforts to complete the resubmission of our BLA and other development and commercialization initiatives or to adequately fund legal proceedings, all of which individually or in combination could materially impede our ability to achieve profitability. The Company's failure to raise additional capital could also affect our relationships with key vendors, including Samsung, disrupting our ability to timely execute our business plan. In extreme cases, the Company could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, discontinue operations or liquidate assets.\nSince inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from the public and private sale of equity securities as well as with proceeds from issuance of convertible notes and related party notes payable. The Company intends to finance its future operating activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity and debt securities. As of the date of this filing, the Company has approximately 65.4 million shares of common stock, authorized for issuance under its certificate of incorporation, as amended, and available for future uses. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities to raise additional capital is likely to result in dilution to stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of common shares. If the Company raises funds through the issuance of additional preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt or equity financing, the related transaction documents could contain covenants restricting its operations.\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into long-term convertible notes that are secured by all of our assets (excluding our intellectual property), and include certain restrictive provisions, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and future dilutive issuances of securities, any of which could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. In February 2022, in exchange for warrants, the Company entered into a backstop arrangement with an accredited investor whereby the Company pledged its patents and the investor agreed to indemnify the issuer of the surety bond in the Amarex dispute with respect to the Company's obligations under the surety bond. Future third-party funding arrangements may also require the Company to relinquish valuable rights. Additional capital, if available, may not be available on reasonable or non-dilutive terms.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements of this Form 10-K for the discussion.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expense and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management bases and evaluates estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following critical policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nWe capitalize inventories procured or produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically, capitalization of such inventory begins when the results of clinical trials have reached a status sufficient to support regulatory approval, uncertainties regarding ultimate regulatory approval have been significantly reduced and we have determined that it is probable that these capitalized costs will provide some future economic benefit in excess of capitalized costs. The material factors considered by the Company in evaluating these uncertainties include the receipt and analysis of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with the relevant regulatory authorities prior to the filing of regulatory applications, and the compilation of the regulatory application. We closely monitor the status of the product within the regulatory review and approval process, including all relevant communication with regulatory authorities. If we are aware of any specific material risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory review and approval process or if there are any specific issues identified relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory may no longer qualify for capitalization.\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Inventories currently consist of raw materials, bulk drug substance, and drug product in unlabeled vials to be used for commercialization of the Company's biologic, leronlimab, which is in the regulatory approval process. Inventory purchased in preparation for product launches is evaluated for recoverability by considering the likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory, in light of the status of the product within the regulatory approval process. The Company evaluates its inventory levels on a quarterly basis and writes down inventory that has become obsolete, or has a cost in excess of its expected net realizable value, and inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements. In assessing the lower of cost or net realizable value to pre-launch inventory, the Company relies on independent analysis provided by third parties knowledgeable of the range of likely commercial prices comparable to current comparable commercial product.\nFor inventories capitalized prior to FDA marketing approval in preparation of product launch, anticipated future sales, shelf-lives, and expected approval date are considered when evaluating realizability of pre-launch inventories. The shelf-life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory the Company considers the stability data of all inventories. As inventories approach their shelf-life expiration, the Company may perform additional stability testing to determine if the inventory is still viable, which can result in an extension of its shelf-life. Further, in addition to performing additional stability testing, certain raw materials inventory may be sold in its then current condition prior to reaching expiration. We also consider potential delays associated with regulatory approval in determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable. In determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable, the Company considers a number of factors ranging from potential delays associated with regulatory approval, whether the introduction of a competing product could negatively impact the demand for our product and affect the realizability of our inventories, whether physicians would be willing to prescribe leronlimab to their patients, or if the target patient population would be willing to try leronlimab as a new therapy.\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the\nanticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 3, Inventories, net for additional information.\nStock-based compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant utilizing certain assumptions that require judgments and estimates. These assumptions include estimates for stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates in determining the fair value of the equity awards. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the equity award. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock at monthly intervals. The computation of the expected option term is based on the simplified method,\u201d as the options issued by the Company are considered plain vanilla\u201d options. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise them, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on limited historical experience of forfeitures, we estimated future unvested forfeitures at 0% for all periods presented. Quarterly expense is reduced during the period when grants are forfeited, such that the full expense is recorded at the time of grant and only reduced when the grant is forfeited.\nWe at times issue restricted common stock and/or restricted stock units to executives or third parties as compensation for services rendered. Such awards are valued at fair market value on the effective date of the Company's obligation. From time to time, we also issue stock options and warrants to consultants as compensation for services. Costs for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more readily measurable.\nContingent liabilities\nWe have significant license and contingent milestone and royalty liabilities. We estimate the likelihood of paying these contingent liabilities periodically based on the progress of our clinical trials, BLA approval status, and status of commercialization. We are also party to various legal proceedings. We recognize accruals for such proceedings to the extent a loss is determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The best estimate of a loss within a possible range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is more probable than another, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If it is determined that a material loss is not probable but reasonably possible it is disclosed and if the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the possible loss is also disclosed. It is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the outcomes could differ significantly from recognized accruals. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, or if an accrual had not been made, could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of this Form 10-K for additional information.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including information about possible or assumed results of our financial condition, operations, plans, objectives and performance that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated and set forth in such\nforward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and potential commercialization of its product candidate, leronlimab (PRO 140), which is being studied for the treatment of HIV infection, NASH, oncology and other immunological indications. Our current business strategy is to seek the removal of the partial and full clinical holds recently imposed by the US FDA in March 2022, evaluate feasibility and timelines for the resubmission of our BLA for leronlimab as a combination therapy for highly treatment-experienced HIV patients, and to seek to further develop leronlimab for other HIV-related indications. We also seek to advance our clinical development of leronlimab for various forms of cancer, including metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( mTNBC\u201d) and other solid tumors, as well as to continue to evaluate NAFLD and NASH, and concurrently to explore other potential immunologic indications for leronlimab.\nAs further discussed in Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Inventories, Note 3, Inventories, net, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, the Company capitalized procured or produced pre-launch inventories in preparation for product launches. The Company considers anticipated future sales, shelf-lives, and expected approval date when evaluating realizability of pre-launch inventories. The shelf-life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory, the Company considers the stability data of all inventories. As inventories approach their shelf-life expiration, the Company may perform additional stability testing to determine if the inventory is still viable, which may result in an extension of its shelf-life. Further, in addition to performing additional stability testing, certain raw materials inventory may be sold in its then current condition prior to reaching expiration. In determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable, the Company considers a number of factors, including potential delays in obtaining regulatory approval, the introduction of competing products that may negatively impact the demand for our product, the likelihood that physicians would be willing to prescribe leronlimab to their patients, and whether the target patient population would be willing to try leronlimab as a new therapy.\nFiscal 2022 Overview\nFiscal 2022 was a transitional year for the Company which included:\n \u25cf Notification that the FDA had placed our HIV and COVID-19 programs on partial and full clinical holds, respectively; \n \u25cf Successfully avoiding an attempted proxy contest seeking to replace the Company's Board of Directors; \n \u25cf Strengthening the Company's Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board through the addition of highly-qualified and experienced members; \n \u25cf Leadership transitions including the termination of the Company's former President and CEO in January 2022 and the hiring of a biotech veteran as its new President in July 2022; \n \u25cf Completion of COVID-19 Long-Haulers, NASH, and oncology studies; \n \u25cf Entering into a research agreement with a leading US cancer research institution; \n \u25cf Resubmission of two of the three sections of the HIV BLA; \n \u25cf Acceptance of five articles into various scientific journals; \n \u25cf Strengthening our pharmacovigilance program, in part in response to the clinical holds placed on the Company by the FDA; \n \u25cf Settlement of an ongoing legal disputes with the Company's former CMO and the 2020 shareholder derivative suit; and \n \u25cf Completion of a number of private offerings to continue to fund the Company's progress. \nClinical and corporate development highlights are provided below.\nHIV BLA and Clinical Developments\nThe remaining BLA section to be completed and submitted remains in progress as of the date of this report. The Company is in a dispute with its former contract research organization ( CRO\u201d); the Company obtained an order requiring the CRO to release the Company's clinical data related to the BLA, which the CRO had been withholding, thereby preventing the Company from completing necessary clinical data submissions to the FDA. The order granted the Company access to the data and the right to perform an audit of the CRO's services. In March 2022, the FDA notified the Company that it had placed a partial clinical hold on the Company's HIV program; the Company was not enrolling any new patients in the trials placed on hold. The partial clinical hold on the HIV program impacted patients currently enrolled in HIV extension trials. The affected patients have been transitioned to other available therapeutics. No clinical studies can be initiated or resumed until the partial clinical hold is resolved, which may affect our ability to resubmit the BLA. The Company's efforts are focused on activities that will allow us to resolve the partial clinical hold and resume the BLA resubmission process. The Company will update the status of its anticipated resubmission of the clinical section of the BLA once it determines a date for resubmission.\nEarlier in fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following:\n \u25cf In June 2021, an animal study was published in Nature Communications regarding the use of leronlimab for HIV PrEP. \n \u25cf In July 2021, the Company submitted its dose justification draft report to the FDA in connection with the resubmission of its BLA. \n \u25cf In August 2021, the Company received guidance from the FDA with regard to its previously submitted HIV BLA draft dose justification report. \n \u25cf In October 2021, the FDA accepted a revised rolling review timeline for resubmitting the BLA, allowing for contemporaneous review by the FDA for sections as they are submitted. \n \u25cf In November 2021, the Company resubmitted two of the three integral sections of the BLA for review by the FDA, the non-clinical and manufacturing sections. \nNASH Clinical Developments\nThere is currently no approved drug for NASH, and liver disease is one of the leading causes of non-AIDS-related death in HIV patients. The Company is identifying the next steps in clinical development and is exploring potential business opportunities to continue the investigation of leronlimab in the NASH indication and HIV patients with NASH. In October 2019, the FDA granted clearance to CytoDyn to proceed with a Phase 2 study to test whether leronlimab may control the effects of liver fibrosis associated with NASH. This trial was converted to an exploratory trial with an open label 350mg arm. The first patient was enrolled in December 2020. Leronlimab 700mg did not reduce mean change in PDFF and cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo and did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Leronlimab 350mg significantly reduced mean change in PDFF and cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo. Despite increased fibro-inflammation, in patients with moderate and severe cT1 values at baseline, leronlimab 350mg showed significantly reduced cT1 from baseline to week 14 versus placebo.\nCancer Clinical Developments\nDuring 2021, the Company reported results from mTNBC patients who had failed at least two lines of previous therapy in the Compassionate Use program, our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, and our Basket trial. The data were insufficient to support resubmission of a Breakthrough Therapy designation request without additional data. The Company is identifying the next steps in clinical development and potential business opportunities to continue the development of this indication, including potentially facilitating research in leronlimab's role in oncology at various academic institutions.\nEarlier in fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following:\n \u25cf In July 2021, the Company's Phase 1b clinical trial for mTNBC advanced to Phase 2 of the trial. \n \u25cf In August 2021, the Company's final mTNBC report indicated an increase in 12-month overall survival and 12-month modified progression-free survival in certain patients. \n \u25cf In October 2021, the Company signed a research agreement with a leading cancer research institution, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, to evaluate the potential synergistic therapeutic efficacy of leronlimab in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. \n \u25cf In January 2022, the FDA notified the Company that its mTNBC data did not demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing mTNBC therapies in the limited number of patients provided; therefore, it could not grant Breakthrough Therapy designation. The FDA indicated that the Company may submit a new request with additional clinical evidence that demonstrates a substantial improvement in second-line treatment of mTNBC over existing therapies. \nCOVID-19 Clinical Developments\nIn March 2022, the FDA notified the Company it had placed a full clinical hold on the Company's COVID-19 program. The Company was not conducting any COVID-19 trials in the United States at the time the hold was placed, and elected to voluntarily withdraw the respective IND. The Company will need to resolve the clinical hold and submit another IND before initiating any future COVID-19 trials in the United States. Further, the Company had elected to pause its Brazil COVID-19 trials pending results from its previously scheduled data safety monitoring board ( DSMB\u201d) meeting in early April 2022. In April 2022, the DSMB for the Brazilian COVID-19 clinical trials met and recommended that the Brazilian COVID-19 trials, previously paused by the Company, may continue based on the review of the interim patient safety data from the clinical trials. The Company is in the process of considering strategic alternatives prior to commencing the enrollment of new patients in the Brazilian trials.\nEarlier in the year, the Company completed the following:\n \u25cf In June 2021, the Company received its first purchase order from Chiral Pharma Corporation ( Chiral\u201d) to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Philippines under a Compassionate Special Permit ( CSP\u201d). This order was fulfilled in August 2021. In September 2021, the Company received two additional purchase orders from Chiral in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.2 million to continue to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Philippines under a CSP. These orders were shipped during the quarter ended November 30, 2021. \n \u25cf In July 2021, the Company was granted a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for methods of treating COVID-19. \n \u25cf In August 2021, the Company received clearance from Brazil's ANVISA to commence its Phase 3 trial for severe COVID-19 patients. The trial was conducted in up to 35 clinical sites with 612 patients. The first patient was treated in this trial in September 2021. Also in September 2021, the Company received clearance from Brazil's ANVISA to commence its pivotal Phase 3 trial in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The first patient was treated in this trial in October 2021. \nCorporate Developments\nIn January 2022, the Board of Directors terminated the employment of Nader Z. Pourhassan, Ph.D. as President and CEO of the Company; he is also no longer a member of the Board of Directors. A committee of three Board members was appointed to initiate the search for a new CEO culminating in the appointment of Cyrus Arman, Ph.D., MBA as President effective July 9, 2022. Antonio Migliarese, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, was appointed interim President and served in that role until July 9, 2022.\nDuring February 2022, the Board of Directors approved the continued appointments to the Scientific Advisory Board ( SAB\u201d) of Dr. Hope Rugo (oncology), Dr. Mazen Noureddin (hepatology), Dr. Jonah Sacha (HIV), Dr. Norman Gaylis (rheumatology), and Dr. Eric Mininberg (oncology), as well as new SAB members Dr. Otto Yang (infectious diseases/immunology), Dr. Kabir Mody (oncology), Dr. Paul Edison (neuroscience/neuroinflammation), and Dr. Gero Hutter (hematology, oncology and transfusion medicine).\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors appointed Karen J. Brunke, Ph.D. as a director of the Company. Dr. Brunke has over 30 years of scientific, operational, clinical, senior executive, and corporate development experience with large and small biotechnology companies.\nResults of operations for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nThe Company's operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on the outcomes of clinical trials, patient enrollment and/or completion rates in clinical trials, entering into new clinical trial protocols, and their related effect on research and development expenses, regulatory and compliance activities, activities related to preparation and resubmission of the HIV BLA, general and administrative expenses, professional fees, and legal proceedings and the related outcomes. As a predominantly non-revenue generating company, we require a significant amount of additional capital to continue to operate; therefore, we regularly conduct offerings to raise capital, which can create various forms of non-cash interest expense or expense related to amortization of issuance costs. Additionally, we periodically negotiate settlement of debt payment obligations in exchange for equity securities of the Company, and enter into private warrant exchanges which may create a non-cash charge upon extinguishment of debt and/or inducement expense. Our ability to continue to fund operations will depend on our ability to raise additional capital. Refer to Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Going Concern sections below.\nThe results of operations were as follows for the periods presented:\n\n(1)See Note 2, Revision of Financial Statements, and Note 14, Restatement.\nProduct revenue, Cost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) and Gross margin\nWe recognized revenue of approximately $266.4 thousand and cost of goods sold of approximately $52.8 thousand in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022; none in fiscal year 2021. Revenue was related to the fulfillment of orders under a Compassionate Special Permit ( CSP\u201d) in the Philippines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Sales were made under the April 2021 exclusive supply and distribution agreement granting Chiral the right to distribute and sell up to 200,000 vials of leronlimab through April 15, 2022. At the time of the sales, FDA approval had not yet been received for\nleronlimab and the product sold was previously expensed as research and development expense due to its being manufactured prior to the commencement of the manufacturing of commercial grade pre-launch inventories. Therefore, COGS consists only of the costs of packaging and shipping of the vials, including related customs and duties. For additional information about revenue recognition and our inventories policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Revenue Recognition and Inventories to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K.\nThere were no revenues or cost of goods sold recognized in the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consisted of the following:\n\nG&A expenses totaled approximately $44.3 million and $34.3 million during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $10.0 million, or 29% over the previous fiscal year. The increase in G&A expenses over the 2021 fiscal year was primarily due to legal and consulting fees and increased insurance premiums, offset by decreases in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. The increase in legal fees was related to the proxy contest and related lawsuits, SEC and DOJ investigations, the Pestell employment dispute, and the Amarex dispute.\nG&A expenses totaled approximately $34.3 million and $20.0 million during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively, representing an increase of approximately $14.3 million, or 72% over the preceding fiscal year. The increase in G&A expenses over the 2020 fiscal year was primarily due to employee compensation and related expenses, increased non-cash stock-based compensation, and higher professional services fees.\nResearch and development expenses\nR&D expenses consisted of the following:\n\nR&D expenses totaled approximately $27.0 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $26.4 million, or 49%, compared to the preceding fiscal year. The decrease year over year was primarily due to lower clinical trial expenses resulting from clinical trials predominantly being administered and completed in prior year related to US COVID-19, oncology, and NASH, the pausing of the Brazilian COVID-19 trials, and the closing of HIV extension studies due to clinical holds placed on the Company by the FDA. The future trend of R&D expenses is dependent on the timing of BLA resubmission and the FDA approval, if any, the timing of FDA clearance from clinical hold, if any, of our pivotal trial protocol for leronlimab as a monotherapy for HIV patients, the future clinical development of oncology and NASH indications, the outcome of pre-clinical studies for several other cancer indications, and potential outcomes of the Brazilian COVID-19 trials. Additionally, the Company concluded the majority of its CMC activities related to the HIV BLA during fiscal 2021, thus resulting in a significant expense decrease in fiscal 2022 as compared to the preceding year.\nR&D expenses totaled approximately $53.4 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $0.8 million, or 1%, over the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The 2021 increase over 2020 was primarily\nattributable to higher clinical trial expenses, partially offset by decreases in non-clinical and CMC expenses. The increase in clinical trial costs were attributable to clinical trials related to COVID-19, oncology and immunology indications.\nAmortization and depreciation expenses and Intangible asset impairment charge\nAmortization and depreciation expense totaled approximately $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $1.0 million, or 57% from the preceding year. The decrease was attributable to the intangible write-off of a proprietary algorithm intangible asset during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 and the ProstaGene noncompete intangible asset becoming fully amortized as of November 30, 2021, resulting in decreased amortization expense of intangibles.\nAmortization and depreciation expense totaled approximately $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million, or 12% from the prior year. The decrease was attributable to the intangible write-off of a proprietary algorithm intangible asset, resulting in decreased amortization of intangibles.\nFor the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022 and 2020, the Company recorded no intangible asset impairment charges. The charge recorded in fiscal year 2021 was attributable to the impairment of the net carrying value of the proprietary algorithm the Company acquired in connection with the acquisition of the assets of ProstaGene, LLC in November 2018, and which was recorded as intangible asset in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nInventory write-off\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the anticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote-off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022.\nThe Company recorded an inventory write-off based on its expected expiration dates of $5.0 million in fiscal 2021. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 3, Inventories, net in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest and other expense\nInterest and other expenses consisted of the following:\n\n (1) See Note 2, Revision of Financial Statements, and Note 14, Restatement.  Interest and other expense totaled approximately $65.4 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $6.5 million, or 9%, from the preceding year. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we recognized non-cash losses on the induced conversion of convertible notes with common stock of approximately $37.4 million, a decrease of approximately $1.8 million, or 4%, from the preceding fiscal year. The losses resulted from separately and independently negotiated exchange agreements to satisfy certain note payment obligations in which certain debt was agreed to be settled in exchange for shares issued at a price less than the closing price for the effective date of the respective transactions. Inducement interest expense related to warrant inducements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, totaled $6.7 million, a decrease of approximately $7.2 million, or 52%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. During fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the Company entered into fewer warrant inducement transactions as compared to the preceding year, resulting in a decreased inducement expense. During fiscal year 2022, the Company issued a total of 10.2 million shares of common stock, including additional shares as an inducement for warrant holders to exercise warrants; by comparison the Company issued a total of 36.2 million shares in connection with private warrant exchanges in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021.\nDuring the year, we also recorded $2.4 million of estimated finance charges related to open amounts due to Samsung. Additionally, we recorded approximately $6.6 million of non-cash finance charges related to 15 million warrants issued under a surety bond backstop agreement as a finance charge in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 7, Equity Awards, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Commitments with Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd. ( Samsung\u201d), respectively, of this Form 10-K for additional information. There were no comparable expenses in the preceding fiscal year. We also recorded $3.9 million of legal settlement charges related to settlement of a dispute with a placement agent and settlement of the Pestell employment dispute. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\nInterest and other expense totaled approximately $71.9 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $6.6 million, or 10%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The increase mainly relates to an increase in loss on the induced conversion of convertible notes, offset by decreases in change in fair value of derivative liabilities, legal settlement expense, and inducement interest. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, we did not realize a change in fair value of derivative liabilities as compared to the prior year, as the originating instruments were all exercised and settled during the 2020 fiscal year. The originating underlying instruments were certain warrants that originated in September 2016 and two convertible note instruments originated in June 2018 and January 2019 containing contingent cash settlement provisions, which gave rise to a derivative liability. For each reporting period, the Company determined the fair value of the derivative liability and recorded a corresponding non-cash benefit or non-cash charge, due to a decrease or increase, respectively, in the calculated derivative liability.\nLegal settlements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, of $10.6 million related to cash damages awarded to plaintiffs in legal proceedings against the Company. Legal settlements (non-cash) for the fiscal year ended May 31,\n2020, of $22.5 million related to the issuance of shares of common stock in settlement of a claim filed by the holder of the January 2019 note alleging that the note holder was owed additional shares upon conversion of the note.\nInducement interest expense related to warrant inducements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, totaled $13.9 million, a decrease of approximately $9.5 million, or 41%, from fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. During fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the Company entered into fewer warrant inducement transactions as compared to the preceding year, resulting in decreased inducement expense. During fiscal year 2021, the Company issued a total of approximately 35.8 million shares of common stock, and approximately 0.4 million additional shares as an inducement for warrant holders to exercise warrants, for a total of approximately 36.2 million shares related to warrant inducements. In fiscal year 2020, the Company issued a total of 65.9 million shares in connection with private warrant exchanges. During fiscal year 2022, the Company identified an error in how non-cash inducement interest expense was calculated in previous reporting periods dating back to fiscal year 2018, resulting in a revision of previously reported inducement interest expense amounts. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revision of Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for the discussion.\nDuring the preparation and audit of the annual financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, the Company concluded that a material error was identified in how the Company was accounting for common stock issued to settle certain convertible note obligations dating back to fiscal year 2021. The Company had been accounting for these transactions in accordance with debt extinguishment accounting. However, although the contractual terms did not explicitly describe the transactions as induced conversions, the transactions should be accounted for as induced conversions rather than extinguishments of debt and are therefore subject to induced conversion accounting. The error resulted in an understatement of the previously reported non-cash loss on induced conversions and additional paid-in capital. The errors had no impact on operating loss, cash, net cash used in or provided by operating, financing, and investing activities, assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies, total stockholders' (deficit) equity, number of shares issued and outstanding, basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, and number of shares available for future issuance for any of the affected periods. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 14, Restatement for additional information. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, we recognized non-cash losses on the induced conversion of convertible notes of approximately $39.1 million. We did not recognize any non-cash losses on induced conversion of convertible notes in fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The losses resulted from separately and independently negotiated exchange agreements to satisfy certain note payment obligations in which certain debt was agreed to be settled in exchange for shares issued at a price less than the closing price for the effective date of the respective transactions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of May 31, 2022, we had a total of approximately $4.2 million in cash and approximately $123.2 million in short-term liabilities consisting primarily of approximately $42.2 million representing the current portion and accrued interest of convertible notes payable and approximately $76.8 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and compensation. We will continue to incur operating losses and the Company will require a significant amount of additional capital in the future as we continue to seek approval to commercialize leronlimab. Despite the Company's negative working capital position, vendor relations remain accommodative and we do not currently anticipate significant delays in our business initiatives schedule due to liquidity constraints. We cannot be certain, however, that future funding will be available to us when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such agreements are deemed favorable to both parties under then current circumstances and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs.\nCash\nThe Company's cash position of approximately $4.2 million at May 31, 2022 decreased by approximately $29.7 million compared to the balance of approximately $33.9 million at May 31, 2021. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we funded our operations by obtaining a total of approximately $48.0 million of net cash proceeds primarily funded through the sales of common stock and warrants.\nSummary of cash flows and changes between the periods presented is as follows:\n Cash used in operating activities decreased by approximately $39.9 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 primarily due to changes in our net loss, working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all of which are highly variable. Cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $117.6 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, which reflects an increase of approximately $48.8 million over the approximately $68.8 million in fiscal year 2020. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was due to increased pre-launch inventories, and net loss, offset in part by the intangible asset impairment charge, increased accounts payables and accrued liabilities, and increased non-cash loss on induced conversion of debt, when compared to the changes in the prior year.\nCash used in investing activities did not change significantly between the fiscal years.\nCash provided by financing activities decreased by approximately $89.3 million which was primarily attributable to decreased funding in fiscal 2022 through convertible debt and decreased proceeds from warrant exercises, offset by proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants during the fiscal year 2022. Cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $137.3 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 representing an approximate $57.7 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in net cash provided from financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from convertible debt issuances and an increase in proceeds from warrant inducement transactions.\nPre-launch inventories\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the anticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote-off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 3, Inventories, net for additional information.\nConvertible debt\nApril 2, 2021 Note. On April 2, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of $28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $25.0 million, after $3.4 million of debt discount and $0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10% per annum, contains a stated conversion price of $10.00 per share, and matures in April 2023. The April 2, 2021 Note required monthly debt reduction payments of $7.5 million for the six\nmonths beginning in May 2021, which could also be satisfied by payments on other notes held by the noteholder or its affiliates. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to $3.5 million. As of May 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was $11.9 million.\nApril 23, 2021 Note. On April 23, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of $28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $25.0 million, after $3.4 million of debt discount and $0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10% per annum, contains a stated conversion price of $10.00 per share, and matures in April 2023. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to $7.0 million. As of May 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the April 23, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was $30.3 million.\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Convertible Instruments and Accrued Interest of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nCommon stock\nWe have 1,000.0 million authorized shares of common stock. The table below summarizes intended uses of common stock.\n As a result, as of May 31, 2022, we had approximately 65.4 million unreserved authorized shares of common stock available for issuance. Our ability to continue to fund our operations depends on our ability to raise capital. The funding necessary for our operations may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we deplete our cash reserves, we may have to discontinue our operations and liquidate our assets, in extreme cases, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, discontinue operations or liquidate assets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of May 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nRefer to Note 6, Convertible Instruments and Accrued Interest, and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is a party to various legal proceedings described in Part II, Item 8, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K. The Company recognizes accruals for such proceedings to the extent a loss is determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The best estimate of a loss within a possible range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is more probable than another, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If it is determined that a material loss is not probable but reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the possible loss is disclosed.\nIt is not possible to determine the outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain,\nand the outcomes could differ significantly from recognized accruals. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, or if an accrual had not been made, could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for further discussion of legal proceedings.\nRegulatory Matters\nFDA Refusal to File Letter re HIV BLA Submission\nIn July 2020, the Company received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its BLA submission for leronlimab as a combination therapy with HAART for highly treatment-experienced HIV patients. The FDA informed the Company the BLA did not contain certain information and data needed to complete a substantive review and therefore, the FDA would not file the BLA. The deficiencies cited by FDA included administrative deficiencies, omissions, corrections to data presentation and related analyses, and clarifications regarding the manufacturing processes. The Company is working with consultants to cure the BLA deficiencies noted and will resubmit the BLA as soon as practical. In November 2021, the Company resubmitted the non-clinical and CMC sections of the BLA and is currently reevaluating when it expects to complete the clinical section. As of March 2022, the FDA had commenced its review of the CMC section. The Company is in dispute with its former contract research organization ( CRO\u201d), as described in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings to this Form 10-K. Recently, in the context of the litigation, the Company obtained an order requiring the CRO to release the Company's clinical data related to the BLA, which the CRO had been withholding. Further, the order granted the Company the right to perform an audit of the CRO's services. Additionally, the FDA recently placed the HIV program on a partial clinical hold, which may affect the ability to resubmit the BLA. The Company is in the process of evaluating the data, results of the audit, and implications of the partial clinical hold. The Company will provide an updated strategy once it completes its evaluation, the impact those results may have on the BLA and an updated strategy timeline.\nFDA Warning Letter re COVID-19 Misbranding of Investigational Drug\nIn January 2022, the Company received a Warning Letter from the United States FDA alleging that its former CEO and President, Dr. Nader Pourhassan, had made references in a video interview to COVID-19 and leronlimab in a promotional context to the effect that leronlimab, an investigational new drug, is safe and effective for the purpose for which it is being investigated or otherwise promoted the drug. The FDA warned the Company that leronlimab has not been approved or authorized by the FDA, its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established, and that the related clinical trial data was mischaracterized in the video. The FDA further alleged the video misbrands leronlimab under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act and in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, as the claims in the video make representations in a promotional context regarding the safety and efficacy of an investigational new drug that has not been approved or authorized by the FDA. The Company is working closely with the FDA to resolve this matter and take the proper corrective actions.\nFDA Partial Clinical Hold re HIV and Full Clinical Hold re COVID-19 Letters\nIn March 2022, the United States FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Company's HIV program and a full clinical hold on its COVID-19 program in the United States. The Company was not enrolling any new patients in the trials placed on hold in the United States. The partial clinical hold on the HIV program impacts patients currently enrolled in extension trials. These patients have transitioned to other available therapeutics and no clinical studies can be initiated or resumed until the partial clinical hold is resolved. CytoDyn is working closely with the FDA to resolve the partial clinical hold as soon as possible. Under the full clinical hold on the COVID-19 program, no new clinical studies may be initiated until the clinical hold is resolved.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had losses for all periods presented. The Company incurred a net loss of $210.8 million for the year ended May 31, 2022 and has an accumulated deficit of $766.1 million as of May 31, 2022. As of May 31, 2022, these factors, among several others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the\nrecoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has had limited to no activities that produced revenue in the periods presented and has operated at a loss since inception. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain a significant amount of additional operating capital, to continue to fund operations and pay its liabilities and commitments, its research into multiple indications for and development of its product candidate, to obtain FDA approval of its product candidate for use in treating one or more indications, to outsource manufacturing of its product, and ultimately to attain profitability. We intend to seek additional funding through equity or debt offerings, licensing agreements, supply and distribution agreements, and strategic alliances to implement our business plan. There are no assurances, however, that we will be successful in these endeavors. If we are not able to raise capital on a timely basis on favorable terms, if at all, we may need to significantly change or scale back operations, including our efforts to complete the resubmission of our BLA and other development and commercialization initiatives or to adequately fund legal proceedings, all of which individually or in combination could materially impede our ability to achieve profitability. The Company's failure to raise additional capital could also affect our relationships with key vendors, including Samsung, disrupting our ability to timely execute our business plan. In extreme cases, the Company could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, discontinue operations or liquidate assets.\nSince inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from the public and private sale of equity securities as well as with proceeds from issuance of convertible notes and related party notes payable. The Company intends to finance its future operating activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity and debt securities. As of the date of this filing, the Company has approximately 65.4 million shares of common stock, authorized for issuance under its certificate of incorporation, as amended, and available for future uses. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities to raise additional capital is likely to result in dilution to stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of common shares. If the Company raises funds through the issuance of additional preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt or equity financing, the related transaction documents could contain covenants restricting its operations.\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into long-term convertible notes that are secured by all of our assets (excluding our intellectual property), and include certain restrictive provisions, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and future dilutive issuances of securities, any of which could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. In February 2022, in exchange for warrants, the Company entered into a backstop arrangement with an accredited investor whereby the Company pledged its patents and the investor agreed to indemnify the issuer of the surety bond in the Amarex dispute with respect to the Company's obligations under the surety bond. Future third-party funding arrangements may also require the Company to relinquish valuable rights. Additional capital, if available, may not be available on reasonable or non-dilutive terms.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements of this Form 10-K for the discussion.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expense and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management bases and evaluates estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following critical policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nWe capitalize inventories procured or produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically, capitalization of such inventory begins when the results of clinical trials have reached a status sufficient to support regulatory approval, uncertainties regarding ultimate regulatory approval have been significantly reduced and we have determined that it is probable that these capitalized costs will provide some future economic benefit in excess of capitalized costs. The material factors considered by the Company in evaluating these uncertainties include the receipt and analysis of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with the relevant regulatory authorities prior to the filing of regulatory applications, and the compilation of the regulatory application. We closely monitor the status of the product within the regulatory review and approval process, including all relevant communication with regulatory authorities. If we are aware of any specific material risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory review and approval process or if there are any specific issues identified relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory may no longer qualify for capitalization.\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Inventories currently consist of raw materials, bulk drug substance, and drug product in unlabeled vials to be used for commercialization of the Company's biologic, leronlimab, which is in the regulatory approval process. Inventory purchased in preparation for product launches is evaluated for recoverability by considering the likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory, in light of the status of the product within the regulatory approval process. The Company evaluates its inventory levels on a quarterly basis and writes down inventory that has become obsolete, or has a cost in excess of its expected net realizable value, and inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements. In assessing the lower of cost or net realizable value to pre-launch inventory, the Company relies on independent analysis provided by third parties knowledgeable of the range of likely commercial prices comparable to current comparable commercial product.\nFor inventories capitalized prior to FDA marketing approval in preparation of product launch, anticipated future sales, shelf-lives, and expected approval date are considered when evaluating realizability of pre-launch inventories. The shelf-life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory the Company considers the stability data of all inventories. As inventories approach their shelf-life expiration, the Company may perform additional stability testing to determine if the inventory is still viable, which can result in an extension of its shelf-life. Further, in addition to performing additional stability testing, certain raw materials inventory may be sold in its then current condition prior to reaching expiration. We also consider potential delays associated with regulatory approval in determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable. In determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable, the Company considers a number of factors ranging from potential delays associated with regulatory approval, whether the introduction of a competing product could negatively impact the demand for our product and affect the realizability of our inventories, whether physicians would be willing to prescribe leronlimab to their patients, or if the target patient population would be willing to try leronlimab as a new therapy.\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration. This is due to delays experienced from the originally anticipated BLA approval date from the FDA. Although these inventories are no longer being capitalized as pre-launch inventories for GAAP accounting purposes, the inventories written-off for accounting purposes continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. The Company also concluded that due to delays of future production certain raw materials would expire prior to production and as such no longer qualify for capitalization. Specifically, the Company evaluated its raw materials against the anticipated production date and determined that while the next production date is indeterminable as of May 31, 2022, specialized raw materials have remaining shelf-life ranging from 2023 to 2026. Therefore, a reserve of $10.2 million for the entire remaining value of specialized and other raw materials was recorded as of May 31, 2022. The Company also concluded that approximately $29.1 million, comprised of five batches of drug product, out of total of nine manufactured, is likely to expire prior to the\nanticipated date the product may be approved for commercialization. Additionally, the Company anticipates that approximately $34.2 million of the drug product comprising of the remaining four manufactured batches, with shelf-lives lasting into 2026, may expire prior to receiving approval for commercialization. The Company wrote off the entire remaining balance of the drug product, in the amount of $63.3 million, as of May 31, 2022. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 3, Inventories, net for additional information.\nStock-based compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant utilizing certain assumptions that require judgments and estimates. These assumptions include estimates for stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates in determining the fair value of the equity awards. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the equity award. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock at monthly intervals. The computation of the expected option term is based on the simplified method,\u201d as the options issued by the Company are considered plain vanilla\u201d options. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise them, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on limited historical experience of forfeitures, we estimated future unvested forfeitures at 0% for all periods presented. Quarterly expense is reduced during the period when grants are forfeited, such that the full expense is recorded at the time of grant and only reduced when the grant is forfeited.\nWe at times issue restricted common stock and/or restricted stock units to executives or third parties as compensation for services rendered. Such awards are valued at fair market value on the effective date of the Company's obligation. From time to time, we also issue stock options and warrants to consultants as compensation for services. Costs for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more readily measurable.\nContingent liabilities\nWe have significant license and contingent milestone and royalty liabilities. We estimate the likelihood of paying these contingent liabilities periodically based on the progress of our clinical trials, BLA approval status, and status of commercialization. We are also party to various legal proceedings. We recognize accruals for such proceedings to the extent a loss is determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The best estimate of a loss within a possible range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is more probable than another, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If it is determined that a material loss is not probable but reasonably possible it is disclosed and if the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the possible loss is also disclosed. It is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the outcomes could differ significantly from recognized accruals. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, or if an accrual had not been made, could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes.
