Additionally, based on current projections and assumptions about the Bank's financial condition and the economic outlook, the Bank expects to maintain a 5.00% (annualized) level of dividend for Class B1 activity stock for the first and second quarters of 2020. The Bank continues to work to support a reliable dividend on its stock, but any future dividend payment remains subject to determination and declaration by the Board of Directors and may be impacted by a change in financial or economic conditions, regulatory and statutory limitations, and any other relevant factors. We maintained rates on both dividends in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in the forward guidance even as the Federal Reserve reduced rates, providing additional value to all of our members. For additional discussion of risks that may impact the Bank's dividend payments, see the Risk Factors section starting on page 18.\nThe Bank plans to continue to share dividend guidance as we have since the third quarter of 2019, subject to quarterly evaluation by the Board of Directors. We use the activity stock dividend as one way in which members receive value from their membership as it rewards members that support the entire cooperative by borrowing from the Bank.\nOn October 31, 2019, we discontinued the automatic weekly repurchase of excess stock. This change enables members to retain excess stock which, for many members, simplifies managing stock balances and provides a dividend benefit on the excess stock. Members can request repurchases of their excess stock at any time.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nExpanding Member Borrowing Capacity and Accepting of eNotes as Collateral\nThis past July, changes were implemented to maximize member collateral value and support member borrowing capacity. The Bank's collateral eligibility guidelines were updated to provide value for previously ineligible collateral categories, such as special purpose commercial real estate, and provide partial value for various loan attributes that previously rendered collateral as ineligible. These enhancements led to a significant increase in member collateral capacity. As we look ahead to this year and how we will continue to expand member collateral capacity and make borrowing easy, we have been developing a solution with the other FHLBs to accept eNotes as collateral. We anticipate the acceptance of eNotes as collateral becoming available for members later this year.\nSharing Legislative News from the District\nIn November 2019, with substantial help from the Wisconsin Bankers Association, and the support of the Wisconsin Credit Union League, legislation was enacted in Wisconsin eliminating the restriction on the amount of collateral that Wisconsin state banks can pledge when borrowing from an FHLB and removed the 20 year limit on advances to state banks from an FHLB. This change allows Wisconsin members to better manage borrowing capacity.\nPreparing for the LIBOR Transition\nThroughout 2019, the financial markets continued preparing for the anticipated phase-out of the LIBOR by the end of 2021. Acknowledging the importance of this transition, we are working to prepare for the transition. For further discussion, see LIBOR Transition on page 49.\nDelivering an Exceptional Member Experience\nAs a cooperative, we are dedicated to delivering the highest value to our members and providing a seamless borrowing experience when transacting with the Bank. This past year was an exciting time of discovery as cross-department teams identified how we can enhance member borrowing experience to reduce processing time, enhance eBanking, and expand the products available to transact online. Toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, members will see these enhancements when conducting business with us through eBanking. We look forward to developing ways to improve member borrowing experience through new and more intuitive technology.\nBecoming a Leader in Diversity and Inclusion\nThe Bank recognizes the communities members serve in Illinois and Wisconsin are becoming increasingly diverse and we believe our Bank should reflect the diverse perspectives of our members and offer products and services tailored to the communities our members serve. Our commitment to make our Bank a leader in diversity and inclusion led the Board of Directors, Executive Team, and a group of our employees to attend our second Cultural Exploration this past November in Chicago's Latino communities.\nCultural Explorations are just one of the ways the Bank is creating a diverse and inclusive culture. The Bank's CEO recently signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge; this pledge has been taken by over 800 CEOs across the nation who believe diverse teams and inclusive behaviors are essential to a strong organization. We are joined together on a commitment to enhance diversity and inclusion in our organizations, share best practices, and participate in a Day of Understanding.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nInvesting in Members' Communities\nDeepening our support of our members' local communities through products, programs, and awards that drive economic development, expand capacity and lending capital, rebuild after natural disasters, and support community leaders is central to our mission.

We had 488 employees as of December 31, 2019, compared to 468 as of December 31, 2018.\nNonpayroll operating expenses\nOperating expenses increased primarily due to a planned investment in information technology, specifically applications,\ninfrastructure and business resiliency.\nOther\nOther consists primarily of our share of the funding for the FHFA, our regulator, and the Office of Finance, which manages our consolidated obligation debt issuances. These costs were $12 million and $10 million for 2019 and 2018. Other also includes MPF related non-operating expenses and offsetting gains on the sale of real estate owned.\nAssessments\nWe record the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) assessment expense at a rate of 10% of income before assessments, excluding interest expense on MRCS.

The smaller\nunrealized loss during 2019 compared to 2018 resulted from decreases in market interest rates for 2019. The unrealized gain balance remaining in AOCI is expected to reverse over the remaining life of these securities.\nNoncredit OTTI on held-to-maturity debt securities\nWe recorded unrealized noncredit impairments on held-to-maturity debt securities during the last financial crisis. As the market has recovered and because we intend to hold these securities to maturity, we are recording accretion to the carrying amount of the securities, reversing the remaining loss balance in AOCI over the remaining life of these securities.\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges\nThe net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges for 2019 compared to 2018 resulted from a decrease in overall market interest rates for 2019.\nPostretirement plans\nThe gain recorded in 2019 primarily is related to the difference between actual experience and that expected based on actuarial assumptions attributable to our post-retirement supplemental defined benefit equalization plan. A portion of the effect will be amortized into earnings over the plan's average employment period remaining before retirement. We do not expect the amount to be amortized to be material to our results of operations.\nWe have not recognized any instrument-specific credit risk in our statements of comprehensive income due to changes in our credit rating.

This\nincrease was offset by declines in our trading, AFS, and HTM securities portfolios that matured or paid down. We resumed making investments in MBS securities starting in June 2018, as noted in Results of Operations on page 40.\nAdvances\nAdvance balances declined slightly at December 31, 2019 compared to year end 2018. Advance balances will vary based primarily on member demand or need for wholesale funding and the underlying cost of the advance to the member. While advance demand remained strong during 2019, it is possible that member demand for our advances could decline further in future periods should their funding needs change, or to the extent they elect alternative funding resources. In addition, as our advances with captive insurance companies mature, our total advance levels may decrease.

In addition, increased utilization by PFIs and the\naddition of new PFIs from our Bank to the MPF Program continue to contribute to higher volume in our MPF Loans held in portfolio.

Our ability to utilize these investments for liquidity purposes may be affected if the credit markets experience disruptions, as discussed below.\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our ability to use Federal Funds sold is restricted under our current policy and FHFA regulations.

In such cases, we also may suffer a credit loss. See Investment Debt Securities by Rating on page 68 for further discussion and a summary of counterparty credit ratings for these investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther sources of liquidity from investing activities include trading debt securities, maturing advances, and maturing MPF Loans.\nLiquidity from Debt\nOur source of liquidity from debt is the issuance of new consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes.\nLiquidity Measures\nWe use different measures of liquidity as follows:\nOvernight Liquidity - Our overnight liquidity requirement is established by our Asset/Liability Committee. Currently, our Asset/Liability Management Policy (ALM Policy) requires us to maintain overnight liquid assets at least equal to 3.5% of total assets. Under our ALM Policy, overnight liquidity includes money market assets, Federal Funds sold, deposits, paydowns of advances, MPF Loans with one day to maturity, and inter FHLB loans with one day to maturity. As of December 31, 2019, our overnight liquidity was $20.4 billion or 20.4% of total assets. This amount represents excess overnight liquidity of $16.9 billion over the minimum threshold of 3.5% of total assets.\nDeposit Coverage - To support our member deposits, FHFA regulations require us to have an amount equal to the current deposits received from our members invested in obligations of the U.S. government, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, or advances with maturities not exceeding five years. As of December 31, 2019, we had excess liquidity of $56.5 billion to support member deposits.\nContingency Liquidity - For 2019, FHFA regulations required us to maintain enough contingency liquidity to meet our liquidity needs for five business days without access to the debt market (the \"Contingency Liquidity Regulation\"). Contingent liquidity is defined as: (a) marketable assets with a maturity of one year or less; (b) self-liquidating assets with a maturity of seven days or less; (c) assets that are generally accepted as collateral in the repurchase agreement market; and (d) irrevocable lines of credit from financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality. Our ALM Policy defines our liquidity needs for five business days as an amount equal to the total of all principal and interest payments on non-deposit liabilities coming due in the next five business days plus a reserve consisting of one-fourth of customer deposits and $1.0 billion. Our net liquidity in excess of our total uses and reserves over a cumulative five-business-day period was $31.3 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOn August 23, 2018, the FHFA issued new guidance on liquidity (the Liquidity AB\u201d) that communicates the FHFA's expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the FHLBs to fund advances and letters of credit for members during a sustained capital markets disruption. In connection with the Liquidity AB, the FHFA also issued a supervisory letter that identifies initial applicable thresholds for certain measures identified in the Liquidity AB. As market conditions warrant, the FHFA may update its supervisory letter to identify new thresholds within the ranges set forth in the Liquidity AB. The Liquidity AB replaces the previous FHFA guidance that required us to maintain daily liquidity through short-term investments in an amount at least equal to our anticipated cash outflows under two different scenarios. Additionally, in light of the Liquidity AB, the Contingency Liquidity Regulation discussed above was rescinded on January 1, 2020, when the FHFA\u2018s amendments to its risk-based capital requirements for the FHLBs became effective (as discussed in Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13).\nThe Liquidity AB requires that: (i) we hold positive cash flow assuming no access to the capital markets for an increased period of between ten to thirty calendar days and assuming renewal of all maturing advances, and (ii) we maintain liquidity reserves between one and 20 percent of our outstanding letter of credit commitments. The Liquidity AB implements a phased-in compliance approach with its guidance; with the full measurement period becoming effective on December 31, 2019.\nTo satisfy our current liquidity requirements, we generally maintain increased balances in short-term investments. Depending on market conditions, the Liquidity AB may require the Bank to hold an additional amount of liquid assets, which could reduce the Bank's ability to invest in higher-yielding assets, and may in turn negatively impact net interest income. To the extent that the Bank adjusts pricing for its short-term advances and letters of credit, these products may become less competitive, which may adversely affect advance and capital stock levels as well as letters of credit levels. For additional discussion of how our liquidity requirements may impact our earnings, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nIn addition, we fund certain overnight or shorter-term investments and advances with debt that has a maturity that extends beyond the maturities of the related investments or advances. The Liquidity AB provides guidance on maintaining appropriate funding gaps for three-month (-10% to -20%) and one-year (-25% to -35%) maturity horizons, which we were required to meet by December 31, 2018. Subject to market conditions, the Bank's cost of funding may increase if we are required to achieve the appropriate funding gap by using longer term funding, on which we generally pay higher interest than on our short-term funding.\nWe are sensitive to maintaining an appropriate liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and liabilities, and we measure and monitor the risk of refunding such assets as liabilities mature (refunding risk). In measuring the level of assets requiring refunding, we take into account their contractual maturities, as further described in the notes to the financial statements. In addition, we make certain assumptions about their expected cash flows. These assumptions include: calls for assets with such features, projected prepayments and scheduled amortizations for our MPF Loans held in portfolio, MBS and ABS investments.\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balances of (1) MPF Loans held in portfolio, (2) AFS securities, and (3) HTM securities (including ABS and MBS investments), by expected principal cash flows. The table is illustrative of our assumptions about the expected cash flow of our assets, including prepayments made in advance of maturity.\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MPF Loans Held in Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Debt Securities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available-for Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Held-to-Maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year of Expected Principal Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After one year through five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After five years through ten years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After ten years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe consider our liabilities available to fund assets until their contractual maturity. For further discussion of the liquidity risks related to our access to funding, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nFHLB P&I Funding and Contingency Plan Agreement. We have entered into an agreement with the other FHLBs and the Office of Finance regarding the Federal Reserve's intraday funding process to provide a mechanism for the FHLBs to provide liquidity to avert a shortfall in the timely payment of principal and interest on any consolidated obligations by one or more FHLBs. We may increase our liquidity ratio for a designated month out of an 11 month rotation to mitigate the risk that we are required to fund under the FHLB P&I Funding and Contingency Plan Agreement. Through the date of this report, no FHLB has been required to fund under this contingency agreement.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nFunding\nConditions in Financial Markets\nIn October 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 1.50 to 1.75 percent and maintained that rate at the December 2019 meeting. October was the third time the FOMC reduced the benchmark interest rate in 2019, following similar rate cuts in July 2019 and September 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the markets predict approximately a 50 percent chance of an additional rate cut by the end of 2020. Throughout 2019, U.S. Treasury yields were lower across all maturities, although these yields were mixed during the fourth quarter of 2019 relative to the end of the third quarter, with lower rates in the front end of the curve and higher rates for maturities greater than two years.\nWe maintained ready access to funding throughout 2019.\nLIBOR Transition\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's (U.K.) Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the U.K., announced its intention to cease sustaining the LIBOR indices after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. The ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its recommended alternative rate. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasuries repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018 and the FHLB System issued its first SOFR-linked debt in the market on November 13, 2018. In January 2019, we participated in our first SOFR-indexed bond issuance and in February 2019, we began offering our first SOFR-linked advance. Many of our assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR, some with maturities or termination dates extending past December 31, 2021. In addition, on September 27, 2019, the FHFA issued a Supervisory Letter (the \"Supervisory Letter\") that the FHFA stated is designed to ensure the FHLBs will be able to identify and prudently manage the risks associated with the termination of LIBOR in a safe and sound manner. Among other things, the Supervisory Letter provides that the FHLBs should cease entering into certain transactions referencing LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. See Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13 for a discussion of the Supervisory Letter and its potential impact on the Bank. For further discussion of the risks related to the replacement of LIBOR, see page 24 of the Risk Factors section. We are currently evaluating and planning for the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the primary replacement rate for investments and advances.\nWe have developed an initial LIBOR transition action plan and convened a project team to implement the transition, which is led by a senior executive and comprised of representatives from various areas across the Bank. Our Asset-Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is the management committee responsible for overseeing the transition from LIBOR. In assessing our current exposure to LIBOR, we have begun to develop an inventory of financial instruments impacted and begun to identify contracts that may require adding or adjusting the \"fallback\" language which provides for contractual alternatives to the use of LIBOR when LIBOR cannot be determined based on the method provided in the agreement. We have amended the terms of certain advance products to include fallback language and the OF has added or adjusted fallback language applicable to FHLB consolidated obligations. We continue to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and investment securities as well as fallback language for new activities and issuances of financial instruments. We are in the process of assessing our operational readiness, including updating our processes and information technology systems to support the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nMarket activity in SOFR-indexed financial instruments continues to increase, including the emergence of a SOFR-based derivative market, and we continue to participate in the issuance of SOFR-indexed consolidated bonds. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we have participated in the issuance of $11.8 billion in SOFR-linked consolidated bonds. We continue to execute LIBOR-indexed derivatives to manage interest-rate risk. We have also begun to use Federal Funds Overnight Index Swap (Fed Funds OIS) swaps as an interest rate hedging strategy for financial instruments that do not have embedded options, as an alternative to using LIBOR when entering into new derivative transactions. We have begun to offer SOFR-linked advances to our members, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, have issued $18 million in SOFR-linked advances. We also offer Discount Note-index floater advances, which some members have used as alternatives to LIBOR-linked advance products.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nVariable-Rate Financial Instruments by Interest-Rate Index and LIBOR-Indexed Financial Instruments\nWe have advances, investment securities, consolidated bonds, and derivatives with interest rates indexed to LIBOR. The following tables presents our variable rate financial instruments by interest-rate index at December 31, 2019 and may not include instruments that indirectly incorporate LIBOR or another interest rate index. The tables also do not consider the impact of any fallback language contained in our financial products. ABS and MBS are presented by contractual maturity, however, their expected maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees.\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Consolidated obligations have GSE status although they are not obligations of the United States and the United States does not guarantee them.\nReliance on short-term debt offers us certain advantages which are weighed against the increased risk of using short-term debt. Traditionally we have benefited from interest rates below LIBOR rates for our short-term debt which has resulted in a positive impact on net interest income when used to fund LIBOR-indexed assets.\nThe following table summarizes our short-term discount notes and consolidated obligation bonds with original maturities of one year or less.

It also services all outstanding debt, provides us with information on capital market developments, manages our relationship with ratings agencies with respect to consolidated obligations, and prepares the FHLBs' combined quarterly and annual financial statements. The Office of Finance will allocate the proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations that cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLB demand for funding during periods of financial distress and when its existing allocation processes are deemed insufficient. In general, the proceeds in such circumstances will be allocated among the FHLBs based on regulatory capital unless the Office of Finance determines that there is an overwhelming reason to adopt a different allocation method. As is the case during any instance of disruption in our ability to access the capital market, market conditions or this allocation could adversely impact our ability to finance our operations, which could thereby adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidated Obligation Bonds\nConsolidated obligation bonds (bonds) satisfy term funding requirements and are issued under various programs. The maturities of these securities may range from less than one year to over 20 years, but they are not subject to any statutory or regulatory limits on maturity. The bonds can be fixed- or adjustable-rate, and callable or non-callable. We also offer fixed-rate, non-callable (bullet) bonds via the FHLBs' Tap issue program. This program uses specific maturities that may be reopened daily during a three month period through competitive auctions. The goal of the Tap program is to aggregate frequent smaller issues into a larger bond issue that may have greater market liquidity.\nAlthough we issue fixed-rate bullet and callable bonds, we may also issue bonds that have adjustable rates, step-up rates that step-up or increase at fixed amounts on predetermined dates, zero-coupons, and other types of rates. See Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations to the financial statements for details. Bonds are issued and distributed daily through negotiated or competitively bid transactions with approved underwriters or selling groups.\nWe receive 100% of the net proceeds of a bond issued via direct negotiation with underwriters of FHLB debt when we are the only FHLB involved in the negotiation; we are the sole FHLB that is primary obligor on the bond in those cases. When we and one or more other FHLBs jointly negotiate the issuance of a bond directly with underwriters, we receive the portion of the proceeds of the bond agreed upon with the other FHLBs; in those cases, we are primary obligor for the pro rata portion of the bond based on proceeds received. The majority of our bond issuance is conducted via direct negotiation with underwriters of the FHLB bonds, some with, and some without, participation by other FHLBs.\nWe may also request specific bonds to be offered by the Office of Finance for sale via competitive auction conducted with underwriters in a bond selling group. One or more other FHLBs may request amounts of the same bonds to be offered for sale for their benefit via the same auction. We may receive from 0% to 100% of the proceeds of the bonds issued via competitive auction depending on:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount and cost for the bonds bid by underwriters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the maximum cost we or other FHLBs participating in the same issue, if any, are willing to pay for the bonds; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>guidelines for allocation of the bond proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also participate in the Global Issuances Program, under which the FHLB System, through the Office of Finance, maintains a process for scheduled issuance of global fixed-rate consolidated bonds. As part of this process, management from each FHLB determines and communicates a firm commitment to the Office of Finance for an amount of scheduled global debt to be issued on its behalf. If the FHLBs' orders do not meet the minimum debt issuance size, each FHLB receives an allocation of proceeds equal to the larger of the FHLB's commitment or the ratio of the individual FHLB's capital to total capital of all of the FHLBs. If the FHLBs' commitments exceed the minimum debt issuance size, then the proceeds are allocated based on actual commitment amount. The FHLBs can, however, pass on any scheduled calendar slot and decline to issue any global consolidated obligations under this program upon agreement of at least eight of the 11 FHLBs.\nConsolidated Obligation Discount Notes\nThe FHLBs sell consolidated obligation discount notes (discount notes) in the capital markets to provide short-term funds for advances to members, for seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in savings flows, and for mortgage financing and investments. Discount notes have maturities up to 365 days and are sold through a selling group and through other authorized securities dealers. Discount notes are sold at a discount and mature at par.\nOn a daily basis, we may request specific amounts of discount notes with specific maturity dates to be offered by the Office of Finance at a specific cost for sale to underwriters in the selling group. One or more other FHLBs may also request an amount of discount notes with the same maturity to be offered for sale for their benefit on the same day. The Office of Finance commits to issue discount notes on behalf of the participating FHLBs when underwriters in the selling group submit orders for the specific\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\ndiscount notes offered for sale. We may receive from zero to 100% of the requested proceeds depending on: the maximum costs we or other FHLBs participating in the same discount notes, if any, are willing to pay for the discount notes; the amount of orders for the discount notes submitted by underwriters; and guidelines for allocation of discount note proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance.\nTwice weekly, we may also request specific amounts of discount notes with fixed maturity dates ranging from four weeks to 26 weeks to be offered by the Office of Finance for sale via competitive auction conducted with underwriters in the selling group. The bi-weekly discount note auction uses a single-price (Dutch) award method to determine winning bids. One or more FHLBs may also request amounts of those same discount notes to be offered for sale for their benefit via the same auction. We may receive from zero to 100% of the requested proceeds depending on the amounts and costs for the discount notes bid by the underwriters and guidelines for allocation of discount note proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance. The majority of our issuances are conducted via the twice weekly auctions.\nDeposits\nWe accept deposits from our members, institutions eligible to become our members, institutions for which we are providing correspondent services, other FHLBs, and other government instrumentalities such as the FDIC.

Under the Capital Plan, each member is required to own capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement or an activity stock requirement. Class B1 stock is available to support a member's activity stock requirement. Class B2 stock is available to support a member's membership stock requirement and any activity stock requirement.\nThe following table reflects the ranges of capital stock requirements permitted under our Capital Plan and requirements during 2019.\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Plan Requirement during 2019\n</td> <td>Range Permitted under Capital Plan d\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Membership Stock Requirement\n</td> <td>0.40% of a member's mortgage assets\n</td> <td>0.20% to 2% of a member's mortgage assets, with a minimum requirement of $10,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cap on Membership Stock Requirement\n</td> <td>$5 million b\n</td> <td>The lesser of (1) a dollar cap set by the Board within a range of $10,000 and $75 million, and (2) 9.9% of our total capital stock outstanding as of the prior December 31.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Activity Stock Requirement for Advances\n</td> <td>4.5% of outstanding advances c\n</td> <td>4% to 6% of a member's outstanding advances, although the requirement may be set as low as 2% for those advances made through our Reduced Capitalization Advance Program (RCAP)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>B2/B1 Threshold a\n</td> <td>$10,000\n</td> <td>$10,000 to $75 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a\n</td> <td>The amount of a member's Class B2 stock that exceeds this threshold\u201d and is necessary to support advance activity is automatically converted to Class B1 stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b\n</td> <td>A member's investment in membership stock is subject to a cap.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>c\n</td> <td>The activity stock requirement applies to all outstanding and new advances other than those advances made through the Bank's RCAP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>d\n</td> <td>Ranges reflected above are from our current Capital Plan, as last amended and restated effective October 1, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOur Capital Plan allows for an activity stock requirement for MPF Loans acquired for our portfolio within a range of 0% and 6%, which our Board has set at 0%. Currently, the Bank does not have a capital stock requirement for the issuance of standby letters of credit. However, we have received regulatory communication relating to the inclusion of an activity stock requirement for letters of credit, the specific terms of which have not yet been determined, and any such requirement will need to be included in an amended capital plan. At such time as the Board decides to introduce, or at such time as our regulator imposes, an activity stock requirement for MPF Loans or standby letters of credit, we intend to notify members sufficiently in advance of the change and apply that change only to future acquisitions or transactions.\nMembership stock requirements will continue to be recalculated annually, whereas the activity stock requirement and any automatic conversion of Class B2 stock to Class B1 stock related to the threshold will apply on a daily basis.\nWe may only redeem or repurchase capital stock from a member if, following the redemption or repurchase, the member continues to meet its minimum investment requirement and we remain in compliance with our regulatory capital requirements discussed below.\nMembers that withdraw from membership must wait at least five years after their membership was terminated and all of their capital stock was redeemed or repurchased before being readmitted to membership in any FHLB.\nUnder the terms of our Capital Plan, our Board of Directors is authorized to amend the Capital Plan, and the FHFA must approve all such amendments before they become effective.\nReduced Capitalization Advance Program\nDuring 2019, we continued to offer our Reduced Capitalization Advance Program (RCAP), which allows members to borrow both short-term and long-term advances with an activity stock requirement of only 2% for the life of the advance instead of the current 4.5% requirement under our Capital Plan's general provisions. As of December 31, 2019, RCAP advances outstanding total $24.2 billion to 142 members. We may implement future programs for advances with a reduced activity stock requirement that may or may not have the same characteristics as current RCAP offerings.\nMinimum Capital Requirements\nWe are subject by regulation to the following three capital requirements:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>total regulatory capital ratio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>leverage capital ratio; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>risk-based capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor tables showing our compliance with the total capital ratio and leverage capital ratio as well as further details on all of our capital requirements, see Note 12 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements.\nUnder the risk-based capital requirement (which was amended effective January 1, 2020, as discussed below), we must maintain permanent capital equal to the sum of our (i) credit risk capital requirement, (ii) market risk capital requirement, and (iii) operations risk capital requirement, as outlined below:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Credit Risk Capital Requirement.

Under our Capital Plan, any dividend declared on Class B1 shares must be greater than or equal to the dividend declared on Class B2 shares for the same period, and dividends may be paid in the form of cash or stock, or a combination of both. All dividends we have paid since 2011 have been in cash rather than stock. We have paid an enhanced dividend on Class B1 activity stock since the fourth quarter of 2013.\nAlthough we continue to work to maintain our financial strength to support a reasonable dividend, any future dividend payment remains subject to declaration by our Board and will depend on future operating results, our Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy, and any other factors the Board determines to be relevant.\nWe may not pay dividends if we fail to satisfy our minimum capital and liquidity requirements under the FHLB Act and FHFA regulations. Further, under FHFA regulations, we may not pay any dividends in the form of capital stock if excess stock held by our shareholders is greater than 1% of our total assets or if, after the issuance of such shares, excess stock held by our shareholders would be greater than 1% of our total assets.\nRetained Earnings and Dividend Policy\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy (Policy) which, as last updated in December 2019, establishes a target for retained earnings to provide a cushion against the potential for loss that could impact shareholder value. Specifically, the Policy requires us to establish an overall target for retained earnings incorporating the following components:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Risk-based targets based on estimates using the greater of (1) modified regulatory-based estimates with components for credit risk and market risk, (2) results of our annual stress test, and (3) parametric value-at-risk estimates for credit and market risk.

Based on our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019, the Board declared a cash dividend of 5.00% (annualized) for Class B1 activity stock and a cash dividend of 2.25% (annualized) for Class B2 membership stock. This dividend, including dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock (recorded as interest expense), totaled $25 million and was paid on February 13, 2020. As further discussed in Executive Summary on page 35, on January 23, 2020, the Bank also provided dividend guidance for the next two quarters.\nJoint Capital Enhancement Agreement with other FHLBs\nThe FHLBs, including us, entered into a Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement (JCE Agreement) intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLB. The intent of the JCE Agreement is to allocate that portion of each FHLB's earnings to a separate retained earnings account at that FHLB. For more information on the JCE Agreement, see Note 12 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements.\nAlthough restricted retained earnings under the JCE Agreement are included in determining whether we have attained the retained earnings target under the Bank's Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy discussed above, these restricted retained earnings will not be available to pay dividends. We do not believe that the requirement to contribute 20% of our future net income to a restricted retained earnings account under the JCE Agreement will have an impact on our ability to pay dividends except in the most extreme circumstances. There is a provision in the JCE Agreement that if, at any time, our restricted retained earnings were to fall below the required level, we would only be permitted to pay dividends out of (1) current net income not required to be added to our restricted retained earnings and (2) retained earnings that are not restricted.\nFICO Dissolution\nOn October 2019, the Financing Corporation (FICO), formed pursuant to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Recapitalization Act of 1987 to provide financing for the resolution of failed savings and loan associations, commenced the process of dissolution in accordance with relevant statutory requirements and the terms of a plan of dissolution approved by the Director of the FHFA. Subject to the satisfaction of any claims and the payment of other administrative expenses upon FICO's dissolution, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2020, any surplus and remaining cash on hand of FICO is expected to be distributed to the FHLBs, as FICO's sole stockholders, in proportion to their ownership in FICO's nonvoting capital stock. The Bank's ownership in FICO's nonvoting capital stock is 9.69%. The receipt by the Bank of any such distribution from FICO will be treated as a partial return of its prior capital contributions to FICO and credited to its unrestricted retained earnings. The Bank does not expect any distribution from FICO to materially affect the Bank's financial condition or combined results of operations.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe provide members with letters of credit for a fee. If a beneficiary draws under a letter of credit, our member either reimburses us for the amount drawn or the drawn amount is converted into a collateralized advance to the member.

Fraud, legal, compliance, financial reporting, model and technology risks are components within the definition of operational risk. We have established programs to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report operational risks such as comprehensive risk assessments, establishing policies and procedures, loss incident reporting and obtaining appropriate insurance coverage to mitigate the likelihood of, and potential losses from, such occurrences.\nGovernance and Control Activities\nThe Board of Directors has established Bank-wide policies governing operational risk, which include an Enterprise Risk Management Policy and an Enterprise Operational Risk Management Policy. Primary oversight responsibility for operational risk is vested with our management level Operational Risk Oversight Committee. Responsibilities of this committee include, but are not limited to, oversight and review of Bank-wide operational risks such as the management of business continuity, technology (including information security) risks, issues or updates, operational aspects of new business activities, analysis and mitigation of any operational loss, vendor management, oversight and direction to our compliance activities, and oversight to internal controls and procedures in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Committee monitors the performance of these operational activities by reviewing management reports prepared by the responsible business manager on a periodic basis. Also, the Committee monitors the effectiveness of operational controls through the reporting of critical operational losses, events, risk assessments, operational risk metrics, and a quarterly certification of operational and internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur executive officers or their delegates provide periodic reports, as appropriate, to the following Board committees: Risk Management Committee, Operations and Technology Committee, and the Audit Committee.\nBusiness Resiliency\nIn order to ensure our ability to provide liquidity and service to our members and PFIs, we have business resumption plans designed to restore critical business processes and systems in the event of a variety of business interruptions. We maintain key information systems infrastructure with vendors that have reliable and consistent data recovery capabilities as well as more optimal geographic diversity to provide a more resilient technology infrastructure. We are party to a reciprocal arrangement with the FHLB Dallas to allow members to access their deposits as well as have access to overnight advances to the extent they have collateral already in place. Both the FHLB Dallas and our off-site recovery plans are subject to periodic testing.\nCredit Risk\nWe define credit risk as the risk to our earnings or capital due to an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with us, or to otherwise perform as agreed. We are exposed to credit risk principally through:\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Member credit products, such as advances, letters of credit, and other extensions of credit to borrowers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>MPF Loans and related exposures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>investment debt securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>securities purchased under agreements to resell;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unsecured short-term investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Community First Fund loans; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>derivatives.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManaging Our Credit Risk Exposure Related to Member Credit Products\nOur member credit products credit risk exposure includes our secured credit extensions, such as advances, letters of credit, and related extensions of credit to members. See Note 6 - Advances and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements for further details on member credit products. We lend to our members in accordance with federal statutes and FHFA regulations. We manage our credit exposure to our member credit products using a risk-based integrated approach as discussed below. We utilize conservative collateral/lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing members' needs for a reliable source of funding.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nEstablishing Credit Limits - Under our credit policy, a member's initial credit limit is set at 35% of their total assets, subject to modifications up or down based primarily on the following factors:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The collateral value of eligible collateral a member has pledged.

We utilize our credit risk rating system to assign each member a credit risk rating from one (lowest credit risk) to five (highest credit risk). Our credit risk rating represents our assessment of the risk of member insolvency rather than the risk of credit loss on the member's credit outstanding with us. We utilize the credit risk rating of a member to manage our credit risk through collateral controls, and as a result, we have never suffered a credit loss on a member credit product. Credit risk mitigation actions may be applied to members perceived to pose increased risk, and are commonly applied to members with credit risk ratings of four and five. Specifically, these members may be:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>required to maintain higher amounts of collateral;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>required to deliver loan collateral to us or a third party custodian on our behalf;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>restricted from obtaining certain member credit products; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>faced with more stringent collateral reporting requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the number of members and related credit outstanding to them by credit risk rating.

The FHLB Act requires us to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure member credit products. Eligible collateral includes whole first mortgages on improved residential property, or non-agency securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages; securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its agencies (includes MBS issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and FHLB consolidated\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nobligations); cash or deposits; and other real estate related collateral (includes home equity loans and lines of credit, farmland, and commercial real estate) that has a readily ascertainable value, can be reliably discounted to account for liquidation risk and can be liquidated in due course and that we can perfect a security interest in such collateral. We also accept pledges of secured business or agri-business loans from community financial institutions (CFIs), which are permitted under the FHLB Act.\nIn certain circumstances, such as when a member's membership is terminated due to a merger and the acquiring entity is a member of another FHLB; the other FHLB may agree to manage the former member's collateral covering advances and any other amounts still outstanding to us and will subordinate to us either certain collateral it receives from the member or certain categories of collateral. Likewise, if one of our members were to acquire the member of another FHLB, we may agree to manage the collateral for the other FHLB and subordinate our security interest in a certain category of collateral.\nOur Advances, Collateral Pledge and Security Agreement requires that a member provide collateral value equal to its credit outstanding (unless we specifically require more for a particular member). The value assigned to securities and loan collateral is calculated as shown below. It should be noted that the applicable percentage margin utilized in the calculation for securities or loans vary based on the type of collateral being pledged, as well as factors (that vary whether the collateral is a security or loan) including model risk, broker fees, market volatility and liquidity, the type of collateral reporting, the member's risk rating, and whether the member is a depository or non-depository.\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For securities, we multiply the applicable margin by the market value of each security; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For loans, we multiply the applicable margin by the unpaid principal balance of pledged loans, along with any applicable percentage applied to adjust for exceptions found during a member's collateral review.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>In general members pledging loan collateral via blanket reporting will receive the margins published, as a percent of unpaid principal balance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>Members with listed and/or delivered loan collateral will generally receive the margins published, which will be applied as a percent to the lower of par or market value of the unpaid principal balance of the reported loan collateral.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nControls over Pledged Collateral - We require delivery of all securities collateral and may also require delivery of loan collateral under certain conditions (for example, when a member's credit condition deteriorates).\nThe FHLB Act requires that each advance to a member be fully secured. We are required to obtain and maintain a security interest in collateral securing advances. The FHLB Act provides that any security interest granted to us by our members, or an affiliate of such member, is entitled to priority over the claims and rights of any party, including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor other than claims and rights that would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual bona fide purchasers for value or by actual secured parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests. We perfect the security interests granted to us by members and affiliates by taking possession of securities collateral and by filing UCC-1 financing statements on all other collateral.\nFor depository institutions, we generally require members to pledge collateral under a blanket lien under which our security interest in collateral is automatically released when the member has sold or otherwise transferred its ownership interest in the collateral (unless otherwise notified by us) and such collateral is not required to secure a member's outstanding credit obligations and we have not required the member to list or deliver such collateral. Under the Advances, Collateral Pledge and Security Agreement with our members, a member must maintain collateral with a collateral value to fully cover its credit outstanding. If the collateral does not have collateral value sufficient to cover the credit outstanding, we require a member to pledge other assets as collateral to cover the shortage, this includes the pledging of types of collateral that are outside of our eligibility criteria. As a result, we may require listing or delivery of the additional collateral from the member at any time while there is credit outstanding. Additionally, we have a lien on their capital stock in us.\nThe method by which a member reports collateral is dependent upon the collateral status to which it is assigned, as well as the type of collateral being pledged. In order for a member to have borrowing capacity with us, the member must report its eligible collateral using one of the following methods. Under blanket reporting, a member that has granted us a blanket lien on certain categories of collateral may report the collateral types on a qualified collateral report. For members that list collateral, either by choice or as directed by us, the member must submit a listing of its collateral which includes loan-level detail of the collateral. Securities pledged to us must be delivered to us or an approved third party custodian pursuant to a collateral control agreement. Loan collateral pledged to us may be required to be delivered to an approved third party custodian pursuant to a collateral control agreement. Regardless of the manner in which the collateral is pledged, all members must report their collateral to us at least quarterly.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nWe also conduct periodic on-site loan collateral reviews to confirm the collateral meets our eligibility requirements. On-site collateral verifications are performed on a schedule that varies based upon, including, but not limited to, our assessment of the credit risk of the member, the size of the member's credit exposure, the types of collateral pledged, and the amount of collateral coverage.\nWe have not recorded any allowance for credit losses for our on balance sheet member credit products nor any liabilities for our off balance sheet member credit products in the periods presented based on the following factors:\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our credit outstanding is sufficiently well collateralized as a result of the collateral and credit risk mitigation efforts described above;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our credit analyses of our members;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The repayment history on member credit products; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>No member credit products that were past due, on nonaccrual status, involved in a troubled debt restructuring, or otherwise considered impaired.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMPF Loans and Related Exposures\nFor a description of the MPF Program see Mortgage Partnership Finance Program on page 8.\nCredit Risk Exposure - Our credit risk exposure on conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio is the potential for financial loss due to borrower default and depreciation in the value of the real estate collateral securing the MPF Loan, offset by our ability to recover losses from PMI, Recoverable CE Fees, and the CE Amount which may include SMI. The PFI is required to pledge collateral to secure any portion of its CE Amount that is a direct obligation of the PFI. The unpaid principal balances of our conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio exposed to credit losses was $8.9 billion at December 31, 2019, and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Our actual credit exposure is less than these amounts because the borrower's equity, which represents the fair value of underlying property in excess of the outstanding MPF Loan held in portfolio balance, has not been considered.\nOur MPF Loans held in portfolio includes conventional mortgage loans that may be viewed as having greater credit risk because the borrowers have weaker credit histories. The current MPF Program eligibility criteria for conforming conventional MPF Loans excludes loans to borrowers with a FICO score less than 620. Historically, we accepted MPF Loans from borrowers with FICO scores below 620 provided they met the underwriting standards set forth in the MPF Guides, which require compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks (issued October 4, 2006) and the Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending (issued on July 10, 2007) issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of the Thrift Supervision, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration. MPF Loans to borrowers with no FICO scores are also eligible for delivery under the MPF Program provided that acceptable alternate documentation of credit history is provided. We do not classify these MPF Loans internally as subprime\u201d because they are not higher-priced mortgage loans. Mortgages that meet the MPF Program's definition of higher-priced mortgage loans are not eligible for delivery under the MPF Program. MPF Loans with borrowers having no FICO scores or with FICO scores less than 660 represent a relatively small portion of our total conventional MPF Loan portfolio.\nFor MPF Loans, the MPF Program allows for varying levels of documentation with respect to borrower income, and the level of documentation is considered when determining the amount of credit enhancement required for each Master Commitment under the credit model we utilize to set the CE Amount. To date, we have not experienced material differences in loss or delinquency rates based on documentation levels of our conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio.\nUnder the MPF Government MBS product, we must advance the scheduled principal and interest payments to the securities holders of Ginnie Mae MBS that we issued if the servicing PFI defaults on its payment obligations to advance the scheduled remittances. Once MPF Government MBS loans are ninety days delinquent, we have the option to repurchase the mortgage loan out of the security and work with a servicer to mitigate the credit loss.\nSetting Credit Enhancement Levels - For conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio, credit losses in a Master Commitment are first absorbed by the Bank's FLA but, if applicable to the MPF product, we will withhold a PFI's scheduled performance credit enhancement fee in order to reimburse ourselves for any losses allocated to the FLA. If the FLA is exhausted, the credit losses are then absorbed by the PFI's CE Amount that is calculated by utilizing third party credit models. For further details on the FLA and PFI's CE Amount, refer to Loss Structure for Credit Risk Sharing Products on page 9 and Conventional MPF Loans Held in Portfolio on page.\nThe PFI's CE Amount is determined by the Bank, based on documented analysis, that the Bank has a high degree of confidence that it will not bear material losses beyond the losses absorbed by the Bank's FLA, even under reasonably likely adverse changes to expected economic conditions. Loans are assessed by third party credit models at acquisition and a credit\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nenhancement is calculated based on credit attributes of the loans in each Master Commitment. Credit losses on a loan may only be absorbed by the CE Amount in the Master Commitment related to the loan.\nThe CE Amounts and the FLA for certain conventional MPF Products held in our portfolio may be periodically reset lower for each Master Commitment after a required period of seasoning because the amount of credit enhancement necessary to maintain our risk of credit losses within our risk tolerance is usually reduced over time.\nFor the MPF Plus product, the PFI is required to provide an SMI policy covering the MPF Loans in the Master Commitment and having a deductible initially equal to the FLA. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the outstanding balances of MPF Loans under the MPF Plus product with SMI coverage were $148 million and $265 million and the amounts of SMI coverage provided against losses were $9 million and $12 million. The reduction in coverage was due to the resetting of SMI policies as provided in the MPF Plus product structure. Credit losses associated with Master Commitments where the SMI coverage has been discontinued are incorporated into the allowance for credit losses calculation. Such credit losses were immaterial.\nThe following table shows the status of our credit enhancement structure on conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio. Unpaid principal balances in this table include REO, as losses in REO impact, and are impacted by, the credit enhancement structure of a Master Commitment. As defined, the CE Amount includes SMI on the MPF Plus product. Government Loans are excluded from the table as they are not directly credit enhanced by the PFI.\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional MPF Product Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90+ Days Delinquent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>FLA a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PFI's CE Amount b\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.88%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.46%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.22%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.63%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Original\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.43%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.51%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a\n</td> <td>For each product above, except MPF Original, a portion of losses experienced at the FLA level may be recovered through the withholding of performance-based CE Fees from PFIs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b\n</td> <td>Credit losses on a loan may only be absorbed by the CE Amount in the Master Commitment related to the loan.

Amounts shown are based on outstanding par value. An overall decline in the economy, residential real estate market, or the occurrence of a natural disaster could adversely affect the value of the mortgaged properties in these states and increase the risk of delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy or loss on MPF Loans, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Par Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Illinois\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unpaid principal balance of conventional MPF Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeller Concentration - During 2019, the top five PFIs, in the aggregate, accounted for 44% of our MPF Loans purchased and held in portfolio on our balance sheet. To the extent we lose our business with these PFIs and cannot attract comparable replacements, our business may be adversely affected.\nFor further discussion of how concentration risks may affect us, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nMortgage Repurchase Risk - We are exposed to mortgage repurchase risk in connection with our sale of MPF Loans to Fannie Mae under the MPF Xtra product, to third party investors under the MPF Direct Product, and to Ginnie Mae for MPF Loans securitized in Ginnie Mae MBS if a loan eligibility requirement or other warranty is breached. We may require the PFI from which\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nwe purchased the ineligible MPF Loan to repurchase that loan from us or indemnify us for related losses or request indemnification from the PFI's MPF Bank as further discussed in the Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nOur mortgage repurchase liability is an estimate of our losses associated with all mortgage loans previously sold in connection with the MPF Xtra, MPF Direct, and MPF Government MBS products for which a breach of representation or warranty has occurred. We consider factors based predominantly on our historical repurchase experience and only include mortgage loans for which we deem it probable that we will be required to either repurchase the mortgage loan or indemnify the applicable third party for losses. This assessment is primarily made during our quality assurance review process. Our estimate incorporates our experiences with third party repurchase demands, PFIs' historical ability to cure repurchase demands, and an assumed loss severity given default.\nThe methodology to estimate the associated mortgage repurchase liability for MPF Government MBS loans also considers potential repurchases based on delinquency activity or lack of final loan certifications within issued pools. We are expected to maintain delinquency rates on outstanding issuances below key thresholds and fulfill operational requirements published by Ginnie Mae.\nWe accrue a mortgage repurchase liability with an offsetting charge to noninterest expense when it is probable and reasonably estimable that we will be obligated to repurchase a loan or indemnify an investor.\nBased on the above factors:\nWe recognized a mortgage repurchase liability of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2019, and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2018, on the MPF Xtra loans. We also recognized an offsetting receivable due from our PFIs, since we deem it probable that we will recover any losses from third parties (e.g., PFIs and other MPF Banks). We believe the estimate of reasonably possible losses is zero as of the end of this reporting period.\nWe have repurchased $8 million of unpaid principal balances related to mortgage loans sold as part of our off balance sheet MPF Loan products for the year ending December 31, 2019, compared to $9 million for 2018, and $4 million for 2017. These repurchases represent repurchase requests that have been resolved during the reporting period. Due to recoveries from PFIs, we incurred no material losses on these loans.\nWe have $18 million as of December 31, 2019, of unpaid principal with respect to MPF Xtra loans that represent unresolved claims with Fannie Mae, in which a repurchase demand may occur compared to $24 million at December 31, 2018; see Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements.\nAdditionally, PFIs are required to repurchase ineligible MPF Loans held in our portfolio unless we either require the PFI to indemnify us or decide to continue to hold such loans in our portfolio. The PFI repurchase requirement is a factor in determining our allowance for credit losses. If a PFI is unable to repurchase ineligible MPF Loans or indemnify us, we would incur a loss to the extent a credit loss is not recovered from collateral provided by the PFI or, alternatively, from the FDIC. In this regard, we have not recorded an allowance for credit losses related to MPF Loans held in our portfolio, as we do not expect to incur any losses after factoring in our recovery claims from PFIs.\nWe record allowances for credit losses for MPF Loans held in portfolio based on available information of past events and the current economic conditions existing as of the date of our statements of condition. Such information includes, but is not limited to, delinquency rates, loss severities, and prepayment speeds consistent with the percentages of delinquent, nonaccrual, and impaired MPF Loans to total conventional MPF Loans. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the financial statements for details on our charge-off policy. Additionally, refer to Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses to the financial statements for further details on our allowance for credit losses.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nFive year trend in our MPF Loans held in portfolio\nThe following table shows the five year trend in our MPF Loans held in portfolio.\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded investment as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPF Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual MPF Loans including nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDR)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TDRs performing - on an accrual basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on original terms (nonaccrual loans/performing TDRs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest recognized (performing TDRs only) b\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses charged to the allowance c\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (reversal of) credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a\n</td> <td>Includes loans which are well-secured and in the process of collection.

Specifically, we generate cash flow projections utilizing key modeling assumptions, significant inputs, and methodologies provided by an FHLB System OTTI Committee, which was formed by the FHLBs to achieve consistency among the FHLBs in their OTTI analyses for private label MBS. We then utilize these cash flow projections to determine OTTI on our private label MBS; however, we are still responsible for making our own OTTI determination, which includes determining the reasonableness of assumptions, significant inputs, and methodologies used, and performing the required present value calculations using appropriate historical cost bases and yields.\nCash Flow Analysis\nWe perform a cash flow analysis for substantially all of these private label securities utilizing two models provided by independent third parties as described below,\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>First model. This model considers borrower characteristics and the particular attributes of the loans underlying the securities, in conjunction with assumptions about future changes in home prices and interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, and loss severities. A significant input to the first model is the forecast of future housing price changes for the relevant states and core based statistical areas (CBSAs), which are based upon an assessment of the individual housing markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Second model.

We also performed a cash flow analysis for each of these securities under a more stressful scenario, or adverse case scenario. This adverse case scenario was primarily based on a short-term housing price forecast that was five percentage points lower than the base case, followed by a path with annual rates of housing price growth that included rates which were 33.0% lower than the base case. Based on the adverse scenario, we would not have had a material OTTI charge.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOther Credit Indicators:\nThe following table presents the outstanding unpaid principal balance and credit ratings on our private label residential MBS by Prime, Alt-A, and Subprime as designated at time of issuance.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are secured by collateral of marketable securities held by a third party custodian. If the fair value of the accepted collateral decreases below the fair value amount required as collateral, our counterparty is required to provide an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral to make up the shortfall. If the credit markets experience disruptions, it may increase the likelihood that one of our counterparties could experience liquidity or financial constraints that may cause them to become insolvent or otherwise default on their obligations to us. If the collateral's fair value amount has decreased below the resale agreement's carrying amount, we may suffer a credit loss.\nThe credit ratings of securities purchased under agreement to resell are disclosed along with investment debt securities and unsecured short-term investments, in the Investment Debt Securities by Rating table on page 68.\nUnsecured Short Term Investments\nWe invest in unsecured short-term investments in order to ensure the availability of funds to meet members' credit and liquidity needs.

For 2018, net interest income was $513 million, which included $32 million of income from AFS investment security prepayments during the period. The decrease in net interest income for 2019 was primarily the result of the decrease in the AFS prepayment fees. \n \u2022 Noninterest income increased by $84 million to $100 million in 2019 compared to $16 million in 2018, primarily due to instruments held under fair value option, which increased by $54 million, from a loss of $19 million in 2018 to a gain of $35 million in 2019. Net gains on trading securities and derivatives increased $24 million combined from 2018 to 2019. \n \u2022 Noninterest expense was $223 million for 2019 compared to $191 million for 2018, primarily driven by an increase in employee compensation and benefits, and planned operating expenses related to information technology and business resiliency. \n \u2022 Total assets were $99.8 billion at year-end 2019 compared to $92.9 billion at year-end 2018, due to strong growth in liquidity assets to continue to meet the needs of members during all economic cycles, along with MPF Loan growth. \n \u2022 Total investment securities increased 8% in 2019 to $23.1 billion, as we increased our purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. \n \u2022 Retained earnings were $3.8 billion at year-end 2019, up from $3.5 billion at year-end 2018, and we remained in compliance with all of our regulatory capital requirements as of year-end 2019. \nSummary and Outlook\nMember Product and Program Use\nIn 2019, 84% of our member institutions used at least one of our core product offerings-advances, letters of credit, or MPF Program products-or participated in our competitive AHP or DPP Programs. Below is a recap of member product and program use in 2019.\n \u2022 Advances outstanding: At year-end 2019, 366 members had advances of $50.5 billion, down 4% from year-end 2018. \n \u2022 Letters of Credit: At year-end 2019, 211 members had letters of credit outstanding of $23.9 billion, down 2% from year-end 2018. \n \u2022 MPF Loans outstanding: At year-end 2019, MPF Loans outstanding on our balance sheet were $10.0 billion, up 41% from year-end 2018. \n \u2022 Competitive AHP: In 2019, $27.7 million was awarded through our competitive AHP to help finance 50 affordable housing projects consisting of 2,671 housing units located primarily in Illinois and Wisconsin. \n \u2022 DPP: In 2019, 192 members reserved more than $19.5 million in DPP grants on behalf of 3,421 homebuyers in member communities. \nReducing the Cost of Advances with the Activity Stock Dividend\nBased on our preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019, on January 23, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Bank declared a dividend of 5.00% (annualized) for Class B1 activity stock and a dividend of 2.25% (annualized) for Class B2 membership stock, maintaining the levels declared for the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, based on current projections and assumptions about the Bank's financial condition and the economic outlook, the Bank expects to maintain a 5.00% (annualized) level of dividend for Class B1 activity stock for the first and second quarters of 2020. The Bank continues to work to support a reliable dividend on its stock, but any future dividend payment remains subject to determination and declaration by the Board of Directors and may be impacted by a change in financial or economic conditions, regulatory and statutory limitations, and any other relevant factors. We maintained rates on both dividends in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in the forward guidance even as the Federal Reserve reduced rates, providing additional value to all of our members. For additional discussion of risks that may impact the Bank's dividend payments, see the Risk Factors section starting on page 18.\nThe Bank plans to continue to share dividend guidance as we have since the third quarter of 2019, subject to quarterly evaluation by the Board of Directors. We use the activity stock dividend as one way in which members receive value from their membership as it rewards members that support the entire cooperative by borrowing from the Bank.\nOn October 31, 2019, we discontinued the automatic weekly repurchase of excess stock. This change enables members to retain excess stock which, for many members, simplifies managing stock balances and provides a dividend benefit on the excess stock. Members can request repurchases of their excess stock at any time.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nExpanding Member Borrowing Capacity and Accepting of eNotes as Collateral\nThis past July, changes were implemented to maximize member collateral value and support member borrowing capacity. The Bank's collateral eligibility guidelines were updated to provide value for previously ineligible collateral categories, such as special purpose commercial real estate, and provide partial value for various loan attributes that previously rendered collateral as ineligible. These enhancements led to a significant increase in member collateral capacity. As we look ahead to this year and how we will continue to expand member collateral capacity and make borrowing easy, we have been developing a solution with the other FHLBs to accept eNotes as collateral. We anticipate the acceptance of eNotes as collateral becoming available for members later this year.\nSharing Legislative News from the District\nIn November 2019, with substantial help from the Wisconsin Bankers Association, and the support of the Wisconsin Credit Union League, legislation was enacted in Wisconsin eliminating the restriction on the amount of collateral that Wisconsin state banks can pledge when borrowing from an FHLB and removed the 20 year limit on advances to state banks from an FHLB. This change allows Wisconsin members to better manage borrowing capacity.\nPreparing for the LIBOR Transition\nThroughout 2019, the financial markets continued preparing for the anticipated phase-out of the LIBOR by the end of 2021. Acknowledging the importance of this transition, we are working to prepare for the transition. For further discussion, see LIBOR Transition on page 49.\nDelivering an Exceptional Member Experience\nAs a cooperative, we are dedicated to delivering the highest value to our members and providing a seamless borrowing experience when transacting with the Bank. This past year was an exciting time of discovery as cross-department teams identified how we can enhance member borrowing experience to reduce processing time, enhance eBanking, and expand the products available to transact online. Toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, members will see these enhancements when conducting business with us through eBanking. We look forward to developing ways to improve member borrowing experience through new and more intuitive technology.\nBecoming a Leader in Diversity and Inclusion\nThe Bank recognizes the communities members serve in Illinois and Wisconsin are becoming increasingly diverse and we believe our Bank should reflect the diverse perspectives of our members and offer products and services tailored to the communities our members serve. Our commitment to make our Bank a leader in diversity and inclusion led the Board of Directors, Executive Team, and a group of our employees to attend our second Cultural Exploration this past November in Chicago's Latino communities.\nCultural Explorations are just one of the ways the Bank is creating a diverse and inclusive culture. The Bank's CEO recently signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge; this pledge has been taken by over 800 CEOs across the nation who believe diverse teams and inclusive behaviors are essential to a strong organization. We are joined together on a commitment to enhance diversity and inclusion in our organizations, share best practices, and participate in a Day of Understanding.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nInvesting in Members' Communities\nDeepening our support of our members' local communities through products, programs, and awards that drive economic development, expand capacity and lending capital, rebuild after natural disasters, and support community leaders is central to our mission. Here is a recap of those efforts in 2019.\n \u2022 Community Small Business Advance: The Community Small Business Advance enables our members to support their local economy and community revitalization efforts in income-eligible communities. In 2019, $1.5 million in interest-rate subsidy was reserved, representing $14.4 million in anticipated lending to small businesses. \n \u2022 Community First Capacity-Building Grant Program: In 2019, more than $250,000 was awarded through the Community First Capacity-Building Grant Program. These grants help participating members strengthen a nonprofit lender's financial position, operational efficiency, and/or human capital in support of their economic development and affordable housing activities in Illinois and Wisconsin. \n \u2022 Community First Disaster Relief Program: In 2019, we committed $500,000 in response to FEMA-declared disasters in Illinois and Wisconsin. Since the program's inception in 2013, we have awarded over $1.5 million in disaster relief funding. \n \u2022 Community First Fund: We committed $47.5 million of the $50 million revolving Community First Fund by year-end 2019 as part of our ongoing effort to directly fund community development financial institutions and community development loan funds. \n \u2022 Community First Awards: In 2019, we awarded $40,000 in Community First Awards to recognize outstanding achievements of our members and their local partners in the communities they serve. Award recipients included an innovative home loan program, leaders in affordable housing and sustainable homeownership, and a development that revitalized a neighborhood through affordable housing and economic development. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards to the financial statements for further details.\nEstimating Fair Value\nSee Note 15 - Fair Value to the financial statements for further details.\nControls over Internal Valuation Methodologies and Third Party Pricing Vendors\nSegregation of duties is a key control over our internal valuation methodologies and third party pricing vendors. In this regard, our segregation of duties are outlined below.\n \u2022 Senior management is responsible for our valuation policies. Senior management's responsibility is independent of our investing and treasury functions. \n \u2022 The Asset/Liability Management Committee approves fair value policies and reviews the appropriateness of current valuation methodologies and policies. Model validation is overseen by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. \n \u2022 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the remediation of gaps in models identified as a result of our governance process. \n \u2022 The Risk Management Group prepares the fair value measurements of our financial instruments, evaluates the appropriateness of the fair values generated by pricing models, and assures the reasonableness and consistent application of valuation approaches and assumptions utilized in cases where unobservable inputs are utilized. In addition, the group performs control processes to ensure the fair values received from third party pricing services are consistent with GAAP fair value measurement guidance. \n \u2022 The Risk Management Group's responsibility is independent of our investing and treasury management functions. \nOther control processes over our internal valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Reviewing the pricing model's theoretical soundness and appropriateness by personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the fair value measurement function. \n \u2022 Back testing models to subsequent transactions (e.g. termination of a derivative), analysis of actual cash flows to projected cash flows, comparisons with similar observable positions, and comparisons with information received from pricing services for financial instruments where prices or valuations require unobservable inputs. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOther control processes over third party pricing vendors, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Understanding and evaluating the fair value measurements received on each major investment security type to ensure that the amounts reported in our financial statements as well as our fair value disclosures comply with GAAP. \n \u2022 Utilizing all fair value inputs received from multiple third party pricing vendors to determine the fair value of an individual security unless we determine that exclusion of a fair value input is appropriate based on our control processes. \n \u2022 Discussions with our third party pricing vendors to ensure that they are in compliance with fair value measurement guidance under GAAP. Such discussions focus on the following: \n \u25aa Understanding their pricing models to the extent possible, as some pricing models are proprietary in nature. \n \u25aa Understanding the principal or most advantageous market selected and our ability to access that market. \n \u25aa Assumptions and significant inputs used in determining the fair value measurement. \n \u25aa The appropriateness of the fair value hierarchy level as of the reporting date. \n \u25aa Whether the market was active or illiquid as of the reporting date. \n \u25aa Whether transactions were between willing buyers and sellers or distressed in nature as of the reporting date. \n \u25aa Whether the fair value measurements as of the reporting date is based on current or stale assumptions and inputs. \n \u2022 Obtaining the third party pricing vendor methodologies and control reports. \n \u2022 Challenging fair value measurements received that represent outliers to the fair value measurements received on the same financial instrument from a different third party pricing service. We document these challenges on a monthly basis. \n \u2022 Examining the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities across asset classes and average life. \n \u2022 Identifying stale prices, prices changed significantly from prior valuations, and other anomalies that may indicate that a price may not be accurate. \n \u2022 Performing implied yield analysis to identify anomalies. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between the amount we recognize into interest income on our interest earning assets and the amount we recognize into interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities. These amounts were determined in accordance with GAAP and were based on the underlying contractual interest rate terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as the following items:\n \u2022 Amortization of premiums; \n \u2022 Accretion of discounts and credit OTTI reversals; \n \u2022 Beginning January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis, hedge ineffectiveness, which represents the difference between changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the related change in fair value of the hedged item is recognized into either interest income or interest expense, whichever is appropriate. For cash flow hedges, recognition occurs only when amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. Such recognition occurs when earnings are affected by the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, hedge ineffectiveness was classified in noninterest income on derivatives and hedging activities; \n \u2022 Net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges; \n \u2022 Amortization of fair value and cash flow closed hedge adjustments; \n \u2022 Advance and investment prepayment fees; and \n \u2022 MPF credit enhancement fees.  The following table presents the increase or decrease in interest income and expense due to volume or rate variances. The calculation of these components includes the following considerations:\n \u2022 Average Balance: Average balances are calculated using daily balances. Amortized cost basis is used to compute the average balances for most of our financial instruments, including MPF Loans held in portfolio that are on nonaccrual status and available-for-sale debt securities. Fair value is used to compute average balances for our trading debt securities and financial instruments carried at fair value under the fair value option. \n \u2022 Total Interest: Total interest includes the net interest income components, as discussed above, applicable to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. \n \u2022 Yield/Rate: Effective yields/rates are based on total interest and average balances as defined above. Yields/rates are calculated on an annualized basis. The calculation of the yield on our available-for-sale securities does not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). \n \u2022 The change in volume is calculated as the change in average balance multiplied by the current year yield. The change in rate is calculated as the change in yield multiplied by the prior year average balance. Any changes due to the combined volume/rate variance have been allocated to volume. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise

Adjusted net yield on interest bearing assets is on a non-GAAP basis, calculated the same as net yield on interest bearing assets, but excluding AFS prepayment fees from net interest income. The prepayment fees on our AFS investments are unpredictable and we cannot be certain of the timing or amount of future prepayments (see Note 4 - Interest Income and Interest Expense for details). Accordingly, we believe that the use of adjusted net yield is useful in evaluating our ongoing operational and financial results in a manner that is consistent with our evaluation of business performance. \n \u2022 Interest income from investment debt securities increased due to increases in volume as purchases exceeded paydowns and maturities. Subject to FHFA regulatory limits as discussed in Investments on page 10, we resumed making investments in MBS in June 2018. \n \u2022 Interest income from advances increased due to higher interest rates, primarily as a result of advances borrowed during a period of rising market interest rates despite market interest rates declining overall in 2019. \n \u2022 Interest income from MPF Loans held in portfolio increased due to higher volumes, as new MPF loan purchases continued to outpace paydown and maturity activity due mainly to refinancing and loan origination activity as mortgage rates have declined. In addition, increased utilization by PFIs and the addition of new PFIs from our Bank to the MPF Program continue to contribute to higher volume in our MPF Loans held in portfolio. The increase in interest income due to volume was somewhat offset by the decline in interest income on MPF Loans held in portfolio that are being replaced by lower rate loans. \n \u2022 Interest income from overnight Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell increased primarily due to higher overall short term market interest rates in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 despite market interest rates declining overall in 2019. \n \u2022 Interest expense on our shorter termed consolidated obligation discount notes increased due to higher volume and interest rates. We issued additional consolidated obligation discount notes to fund demand for our advances and other assets. Interest rates increased due to higher overall short term market interest rates in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 despite market interest rates declining in 2019. \n \u2022 Interest expense on our longer termed consolidated obligation bonds increased primarily due to higher interest rates, as the bonds were issued during a period of rising market interest rates despite market interest rates declining overall in 2019.

The smaller\nunrealized loss during 2019 compared to 2018 resulted from decreases in market interest rates for 2019. The unrealized gain balance remaining in AOCI is expected to reverse over the remaining life of these securities.\nNoncredit OTTI on held-to-maturity debt securities\nWe recorded unrealized noncredit impairments on held-to-maturity debt securities during the last financial crisis. As the market has recovered and because we intend to hold these securities to maturity, we are recording accretion to the carrying amount of the securities, reversing the remaining loss balance in AOCI over the remaining life of these securities.\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges\nThe net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges for 2019 compared to 2018 resulted from a decrease in overall market interest rates for 2019.\nPostretirement plans\nThe gain recorded in 2019 primarily is related to the difference between actual experience and that expected based on actuarial assumptions attributable to our post-retirement supplemental defined benefit equalization plan. A portion of the effect will be amortized into earnings over the plan's average employment period remaining before retirement. We do not expect the amount to be amortized to be material to our results of operations.\nWe have not recognized any instrument-specific credit risk in our statements of comprehensive income due to changes in our credit rating.

This\nincrease was offset by declines in our trading, AFS, and HTM securities portfolios that matured or paid down. We resumed making investments in MBS securities starting in June 2018, as noted in Results of Operations on page 40.\nAdvances\nAdvance balances declined slightly at December 31, 2019 compared to year end 2018. Advance balances will vary based primarily on member demand or need for wholesale funding and the underlying cost of the advance to the member. While advance demand remained strong during 2019, it is possible that member demand for our advances could decline further in future periods should their funding needs change, or to the extent they elect alternative funding resources. In addition, as our advances with captive insurance companies mature, our total advance levels may decrease. See Risk Factor starting on page 18 for details regarding captive insurance companies.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table sets forth the current period par amount of advances outstanding for the five largest advance borrowers:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One Mortgage Partners Corp.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>a\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Northern Trust Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BMO Harris Bank, NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Associated Bank, NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State Farm Bank, F.S.B.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other borrowers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n a One Mortgage Partners Corp. is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank NA. \nThe following table presents outstanding advances by type of institution.

In addition, increased utilization by PFIs and the\naddition of new PFIs from our Bank to the MPF Program continue to contribute to higher volume in our MPF Loans held in portfolio. In\naddition to our MPF Loans held in portfolio, we have MPF off-balance sheet products, where we buy and concurrently resell MPF\nLoans to Fannie Mae or other third party investors or pool and securitize them into Ginnie Mae MBS. See MPF Program Overview on page 8 for details.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nLiquidity, Funding, & Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe establish our liquidity position primarily based on the factors outlined below.\n \u2022 FHFA regulations and guidance. \n \u2022 Policies established by our Board of Directors. \n \u2022 Member demand for short- and long-term funds. \n \u2022 Maturing consolidated obligations as well as obligations arising from our normal operating activities. \nWe seek to be in a position to meet our members' credit and liquidity needs without maintaining excessive holdings of low-yielding liquid investments or being forced to incur unnecessarily high borrowing costs.\nLiquidity from Investments\nOur sources of liquidity from investments are short-term liquid assets, primarily overnight Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Our ability to utilize these investments for liquidity purposes may be affected if the credit markets experience disruptions, as discussed below.\n \u2022 Our ability to use Federal Funds sold is restricted under our current policy and FHFA regulations. Specifically, we restrict these investments to short maturities and eligible counterparties as discussed in Unsecured Short Term Investments on page 70 because such investments are unsecured. If the credit markets experience disruptions, and as a result one of our counterparties became insolvent or otherwise defaulted on their obligation to us, these investments would not satisfy our liquidity needs and we may incur a credit loss. \n \u2022 Securities purchased under agreements to resell are secured by marketable securities held by a third party custodian. If the credit markets experience disruptions, and as a result one of our counterparties became insolvent or otherwise defaulted on their obligations to us, these investments would not satisfy our liquidity needs if the collateral pledged to secure those obligations has decreased in value. In such cases, we also may suffer a credit loss. See Investment Debt Securities by Rating on page 68 for further discussion and a summary of counterparty credit ratings for these investments. \nOther sources of liquidity from investing activities include trading debt securities, maturing advances, and maturing MPF Loans.\nLiquidity from Debt\nOur source of liquidity from debt is the issuance of new consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes.\nLiquidity Measures\nWe use different measures of liquidity as follows:\nOvernight Liquidity - Our overnight liquidity requirement is established by our Asset/Liability Committee. Currently, our Asset/Liability Management Policy (ALM Policy) requires us to maintain overnight liquid assets at least equal to 3.5% of total assets. Under our ALM Policy, overnight liquidity includes money market assets, Federal Funds sold, deposits, paydowns of advances, MPF Loans with one day to maturity, and inter FHLB loans with one day to maturity. As of December 31, 2019, our overnight liquidity was $20.4 billion or 20.4% of total assets. This amount represents excess overnight liquidity of $16.9 billion over the minimum threshold of 3.5% of total assets.\nDeposit Coverage - To support our member deposits, FHFA regulations require us to have an amount equal to the current deposits received from our members invested in obligations of the U.S. government, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, or advances with maturities not exceeding five years. As of December 31, 2019, we had excess liquidity of $56.5 billion to support member deposits.\nContingency Liquidity - For 2019, FHFA regulations required us to maintain enough contingency liquidity to meet our liquidity needs for five business days without access to the debt market (the \"Contingency Liquidity Regulation\"). Contingent liquidity is defined as: (a) marketable assets with a maturity of one year or less; (b) self-liquidating assets with a maturity of seven days or less; (c) assets that are generally accepted as collateral in the repurchase agreement market; and (d) irrevocable lines of credit from financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality. Our ALM Policy defines our liquidity needs for five business days as an amount equal to the total of all principal and interest payments on non-deposit liabilities coming due in the next five business days plus a reserve consisting of one-fourth of customer deposits and $1.0 billion. Our net liquidity in excess of our total uses and reserves over a cumulative five-business-day period was $31.3 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOn August 23, 2018, the FHFA issued new guidance on liquidity (the Liquidity AB\u201d) that communicates the FHFA's expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the FHLBs to fund advances and letters of credit for members during a sustained capital markets disruption. In connection with the Liquidity AB, the FHFA also issued a supervisory letter that identifies initial applicable thresholds for certain measures identified in the Liquidity AB. As market conditions warrant, the FHFA may update its supervisory letter to identify new thresholds within the ranges set forth in the Liquidity AB. The Liquidity AB replaces the previous FHFA guidance that required us to maintain daily liquidity through short-term investments in an amount at least equal to our anticipated cash outflows under two different scenarios. Additionally, in light of the Liquidity AB, the Contingency Liquidity Regulation discussed above was rescinded on January 1, 2020, when the FHFA\u2018s amendments to its risk-based capital requirements for the FHLBs became effective (as discussed in Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13).\nThe Liquidity AB requires that: (i) we hold positive cash flow assuming no access to the capital markets for an increased period of between ten to thirty calendar days and assuming renewal of all maturing advances, and (ii) we maintain liquidity reserves between one and 20 percent of our outstanding letter of credit commitments. The Liquidity AB implements a phased-in compliance approach with its guidance; with the full measurement period becoming effective on December 31, 2019.\nTo satisfy our current liquidity requirements, we generally maintain increased balances in short-term investments. Depending on market conditions, the Liquidity AB may require the Bank to hold an additional amount of liquid assets, which could reduce the Bank's ability to invest in higher-yielding assets, and may in turn negatively impact net interest income. To the extent that the Bank adjusts pricing for its short-term advances and letters of credit, these products may become less competitive, which may adversely affect advance and capital stock levels as well as letters of credit levels. For additional discussion of how our liquidity requirements may impact our earnings, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nIn addition, we fund certain overnight or shorter-term investments and advances with debt that has a maturity that extends beyond the maturities of the related investments or advances. The Liquidity AB provides guidance on maintaining appropriate funding gaps for three-month (-10% to -20%) and one-year (-25% to -35%) maturity horizons, which we were required to meet by December 31, 2018. Subject to market conditions, the Bank's cost of funding may increase if we are required to achieve the appropriate funding gap by using longer term funding, on which we generally pay higher interest than on our short-term funding.\nWe are sensitive to maintaining an appropriate liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and liabilities, and we measure and monitor the risk of refunding such assets as liabilities mature (refunding risk). In measuring the level of assets requiring refunding, we take into account their contractual maturities, as further described in the notes to the financial statements. In addition, we make certain assumptions about their expected cash flows. These assumptions include: calls for assets with such features, projected prepayments and scheduled amortizations for our MPF Loans held in portfolio, MBS and ABS investments.\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balances of (1) MPF Loans held in portfolio, (2) AFS securities, and (3) HTM securities (including ABS and MBS investments), by expected principal cash flows. The table is illustrative of our assumptions about the expected cash flow of our assets, including prepayments made in advance of maturity.\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MPF Loans Held in Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Debt Securities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available-for Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Held-to-Maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year of Expected Principal Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After one year through five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After five years through ten years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After ten years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe consider our liabilities available to fund assets until their contractual maturity. For further discussion of the liquidity risks related to our access to funding, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nFHLB P&I Funding and Contingency Plan Agreement. We have entered into an agreement with the other FHLBs and the Office of Finance regarding the Federal Reserve's intraday funding process to provide a mechanism for the FHLBs to provide liquidity to avert a shortfall in the timely payment of principal and interest on any consolidated obligations by one or more FHLBs. We may increase our liquidity ratio for a designated month out of an 11 month rotation to mitigate the risk that we are required to fund under the FHLB P&I Funding and Contingency Plan Agreement. Through the date of this report, no FHLB has been required to fund under this contingency agreement.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nFunding\nConditions in Financial Markets\nIn October 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 1.50 to 1.75 percent and maintained that rate at the December 2019 meeting. October was the third time the FOMC reduced the benchmark interest rate in 2019, following similar rate cuts in July 2019 and September 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the markets predict approximately a 50 percent chance of an additional rate cut by the end of 2020. Throughout 2019, U.S. Treasury yields were lower across all maturities, although these yields were mixed during the fourth quarter of 2019 relative to the end of the third quarter, with lower rates in the front end of the curve and higher rates for maturities greater than two years.\nWe maintained ready access to funding throughout 2019.\nLIBOR Transition\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's (U.K.) Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the U.K., announced its intention to cease sustaining the LIBOR indices after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. The ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its recommended alternative rate. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasuries repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018 and the FHLB System issued its first SOFR-linked debt in the market on November 13, 2018. In January 2019, we participated in our first SOFR-indexed bond issuance and in February 2019, we began offering our first SOFR-linked advance. Many of our assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR, some with maturities or termination dates extending past December 31, 2021. In addition, on September 27, 2019, the FHFA issued a Supervisory Letter (the \"Supervisory Letter\") that the FHFA stated is designed to ensure the FHLBs will be able to identify and prudently manage the risks associated with the termination of LIBOR in a safe and sound manner. Among other things, the Supervisory Letter provides that the FHLBs should cease entering into certain transactions referencing LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. See Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13 for a discussion of the Supervisory Letter and its potential impact on the Bank. For further discussion of the risks related to the replacement of LIBOR, see page 24 of the Risk Factors section. We are currently evaluating and planning for the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the primary replacement rate for investments and advances.\nWe have developed an initial LIBOR transition action plan and convened a project team to implement the transition, which is led by a senior executive and comprised of representatives from various areas across the Bank. Our Asset-Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is the management committee responsible for overseeing the transition from LIBOR. In assessing our current exposure to LIBOR, we have begun to develop an inventory of financial instruments impacted and begun to identify contracts that may require adding or adjusting the \"fallback\" language which provides for contractual alternatives to the use of LIBOR when LIBOR cannot be determined based on the method provided in the agreement. We have amended the terms of certain advance products to include fallback language and the OF has added or adjusted fallback language applicable to FHLB consolidated obligations. We continue to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and investment securities as well as fallback language for new activities and issuances of financial instruments. We are in the process of assessing our operational readiness, including updating our processes and information technology systems to support the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nMarket activity in SOFR-indexed financial instruments continues to increase, including the emergence of a SOFR-based derivative market, and we continue to participate in the issuance of SOFR-indexed consolidated bonds. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we have participated in the issuance of $11.8 billion in SOFR-linked consolidated bonds. We continue to execute LIBOR-indexed derivatives to manage interest-rate risk. We have also begun to use Federal Funds Overnight Index Swap (Fed Funds OIS) swaps as an interest rate hedging strategy for financial instruments that do not have embedded options, as an alternative to using LIBOR when entering into new derivative transactions. We have begun to offer SOFR-linked advances to our members, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, have issued $18 million in SOFR-linked advances. We also offer Discount Note-index floater advances, which some members have used as alternatives to LIBOR-linked advance products.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nVariable-Rate Financial Instruments by Interest-Rate Index and LIBOR-Indexed Financial Instruments\nWe have advances, investment securities, consolidated bonds, and derivatives with interest rates indexed to LIBOR. The following tables presents our variable rate financial instruments by interest-rate index at December 31, 2019 and may not include instruments that indirectly incorporate LIBOR or another interest rate index. The tables also do not consider the impact of any fallback language contained in our financial products. ABS and MBS are presented by contractual maturity, however, their expected maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with

competitively priced funding, a reasonable return on their investment in our capital stock, and support for their community investment activities. Our assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by member-driven activities and market conditions. We believe the cash flows from our operating and financing activities are sufficient to fund both our operating and investing liquidity needs.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities changed for the following reasons:\n \u2022 We had a net decrease in funds provided from discount notes as we took advantage of more favorable rates on longer termed bonds as noted below. \n \u2022 We increased the amount of our consolidated obligation bonds used to fund the growth in our balance sheet as we continued to take advantage of favorable variable interest rates on longer term bonds as compared to a higher reliance on discount notes. \nSources of Funding\nWe fund our assets principally with consolidated obligations (bonds and discount notes) issued through the Office of Finance, deposits, and capital stock. As of December 31, 2019, our consolidated obligations were rated AA+ (with outlook stable) by S&P and Aaa (with outlook stable) by Moody's. Consolidated obligations have GSE status although they are not obligations of the United States and the United States does not guarantee them.\nReliance on short-term debt offers us certain advantages which are weighed against the increased risk of using short-term debt. Traditionally we have benefited from interest rates below LIBOR rates for our short-term debt which has resulted in a positive impact on net interest income when used to fund LIBOR-indexed assets.\nThe following table summarizes our short-term discount notes and consolidated obligation bonds with original maturities of one year or less.

It also services all outstanding debt, provides us with information on capital market developments, manages our relationship with ratings agencies with respect to consolidated obligations, and prepares the FHLBs' combined quarterly and annual financial statements. The Office of Finance will allocate the proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations that cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLB demand for funding during periods of financial distress and when its existing allocation processes are deemed insufficient. In general, the proceeds in such circumstances will be allocated among the FHLBs based on regulatory capital unless the Office of Finance determines that there is an overwhelming reason to adopt a different allocation method. As is the case during any instance of disruption in our ability to access the capital market, market conditions or this allocation could adversely impact our ability to finance our operations, which could thereby adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidated Obligation Bonds\nConsolidated obligation bonds (bonds) satisfy term funding requirements and are issued under various programs. The maturities of these securities may range from less than one year to over 20 years, but they are not subject to any statutory or regulatory limits on maturity. The bonds can be fixed- or adjustable-rate, and callable or non-callable. We also offer fixed-rate, non-callable (bullet) bonds via the FHLBs' Tap issue program. This program uses specific maturities that may be reopened daily during a three month period through competitive auctions. The goal of the Tap program is to aggregate frequent smaller issues into a larger bond issue that may have greater market liquidity.\nAlthough we issue fixed-rate bullet and callable bonds, we may also issue bonds that have adjustable rates, step-up rates that step-up or increase at fixed amounts on predetermined dates, zero-coupons, and other types of rates. See Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations to the financial statements for details. Bonds are issued and distributed daily through negotiated or competitively bid transactions with approved underwriters or selling groups.\nWe receive 100% of the net proceeds of a bond issued via direct negotiation with underwriters of FHLB debt when we are the only FHLB involved in the negotiation; we are the sole FHLB that is primary obligor on the bond in those cases. When we and one or more other FHLBs jointly negotiate the issuance of a bond directly with underwriters, we receive the portion of the proceeds of the bond agreed upon with the other FHLBs; in those cases, we are primary obligor for the pro rata portion of the bond based on proceeds received. The majority of our bond issuance is conducted via direct negotiation with underwriters of the FHLB bonds, some with, and some without, participation by other FHLBs.\nWe may also request specific bonds to be offered by the Office of Finance for sale via competitive auction conducted with underwriters in a bond selling group. One or more other FHLBs may request amounts of the same bonds to be offered for sale for their benefit via the same auction. We may receive from 0% to 100% of the proceeds of the bonds issued via competitive auction depending on:\n \u2022 the amount and cost for the bonds bid by underwriters; \n \u2022 the maximum cost we or other FHLBs participating in the same issue, if any, are willing to pay for the bonds; and \n \u2022 guidelines for allocation of the bond proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance. \nWe also participate in the Global Issuances Program, under which the FHLB System, through the Office of Finance, maintains a process for scheduled issuance of global fixed-rate consolidated bonds. As part of this process, management from each FHLB determines and communicates a firm commitment to the Office of Finance for an amount of scheduled global debt to be issued on its behalf. If the FHLBs' orders do not meet the minimum debt issuance size, each FHLB receives an allocation of proceeds equal to the larger of the FHLB's commitment or the ratio of the individual FHLB's capital to total capital of all of the FHLBs. If the FHLBs' commitments exceed the minimum debt issuance size, then the proceeds are allocated based on actual commitment amount. The FHLBs can, however, pass on any scheduled calendar slot and decline to issue any global consolidated obligations under this program upon agreement of at least eight of the 11 FHLBs.\nConsolidated Obligation Discount Notes\nThe FHLBs sell consolidated obligation discount notes (discount notes) in the capital markets to provide short-term funds for advances to members, for seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in savings flows, and for mortgage financing and investments. Discount notes have maturities up to 365 days and are sold through a selling group and through other authorized securities dealers. Discount notes are sold at a discount and mature at par.\nOn a daily basis, we may request specific amounts of discount notes with specific maturity dates to be offered by the Office of Finance at a specific cost for sale to underwriters in the selling group. One or more other FHLBs may also request an amount of discount notes with the same maturity to be offered for sale for their benefit on the same day. The Office of Finance commits to issue discount notes on behalf of the participating FHLBs when underwriters in the selling group submit orders for the specific\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\ndiscount notes offered for sale. We may receive from zero to 100% of the requested proceeds depending on: the maximum costs we or other FHLBs participating in the same discount notes, if any, are willing to pay for the discount notes; the amount of orders for the discount notes submitted by underwriters; and guidelines for allocation of discount note proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance.\nTwice weekly, we may also request specific amounts of discount notes with fixed maturity dates ranging from four weeks to 26 weeks to be offered by the Office of Finance for sale via competitive auction conducted with underwriters in the selling group. The bi-weekly discount note auction uses a single-price (Dutch) award method to determine winning bids. One or more FHLBs may also request amounts of those same discount notes to be offered for sale for their benefit via the same auction. We may receive from zero to 100% of the requested proceeds depending on the amounts and costs for the discount notes bid by the underwriters and guidelines for allocation of discount note proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance. The majority of our issuances are conducted via the twice weekly auctions.\nDeposits\nWe accept deposits from our members, institutions eligible to become our members, institutions for which we are providing correspondent services, other FHLBs, and other government instrumentalities such as the FDIC. We offer several types of deposits to our deposit customers including demand, overnight, and term deposits. Deposits are not a significant source of funding for our operations and are primarily offered for the convenience of our members doing business with us.\nThe following table presents average deposit balances and the rate paid.

At such time as the Board decides to introduce, or at such time as our regulator imposes, an activity stock requirement for MPF Loans or standby letters of credit, we intend to notify members sufficiently in advance of the change and apply that change only to future acquisitions or transactions.\nMembership stock requirements will continue to be recalculated annually, whereas the activity stock requirement and any automatic conversion of Class B2 stock to Class B1 stock related to the threshold will apply on a daily basis.\nWe may only redeem or repurchase capital stock from a member if, following the redemption or repurchase, the member continues to meet its minimum investment requirement and we remain in compliance with our regulatory capital requirements discussed below.\nMembers that withdraw from membership must wait at least five years after their membership was terminated and all of their capital stock was redeemed or repurchased before being readmitted to membership in any FHLB.\nUnder the terms of our Capital Plan, our Board of Directors is authorized to amend the Capital Plan, and the FHFA must approve all such amendments before they become effective.\nReduced Capitalization Advance Program\nDuring 2019, we continued to offer our Reduced Capitalization Advance Program (RCAP), which allows members to borrow both short-term and long-term advances with an activity stock requirement of only 2% for the life of the advance instead of the current 4.5% requirement under our Capital Plan's general provisions. As of December 31, 2019, RCAP advances outstanding total $24.2 billion to 142 members. We may implement future programs for advances with a reduced activity stock requirement that may or may not have the same characteristics as current RCAP offerings.\nMinimum Capital Requirements\nWe are subject by regulation to the following three capital requirements:\n \u2022 total regulatory capital ratio; \n \u2022 leverage capital ratio; and \n \u2022 risk-based capital. \nFor tables showing our compliance with the total capital ratio and leverage capital ratio as well as further details on all of our capital requirements, see Note 12 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements.\nUnder the risk-based capital requirement (which was amended effective January 1, 2020, as discussed below), we must maintain permanent capital equal to the sum of our (i) credit risk capital requirement, (ii) market risk capital requirement, and (iii) operations risk capital requirement, as outlined below:\n \u2022 Credit Risk Capital Requirement. The credit risk capital requirement is the sum of the capital charges for our assets, off balance sheet items, and derivatives contracts. These capital charges are calculated using the methodologies and percentages assigned by the FHFA regulations to each class of assets. \n \u2022 Market Risk Capital Requirement. The market risk capital requirement is the sum of (a) the market value of our portfolio at risk from movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices that could occur during periods of market stress; and (b) the amount, if any, by which the market value of total capital is less than 85% of the book value of total capital. \n \u2022 Operations Risk Capital Requirement. The operations risk capital requirement is 30% of the sum of our (a) credit risk capital requirement and (b) market risk capital requirement. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table summarizes our risk-based capital amounts. Under the FHFA regulation on capital classifications and critical capital levels for the FHLBs, we were adequately capitalized.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable capital stock (MRCS) recorded as a liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total permanent capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit risk capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market risk capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations risk capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk based capital requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess permanent capital stock over risk based capital requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed in Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13, effective January 1, 2020 amended FHFA regulations revised: (1) the credit risk component of the risk-based capital requirements through certain changes to the capital charges assigned to advances, non-mortgage assets, off-balance sheet assets and derivatives, and (2) the market risk component of the requirements by repealing the 85% requirement (i.e., that market risk capital include an amount equal to the market value of the Bank's total capital that is less than 85% of the book value of the Bank's total capital). The Bank does not expect that the revisions to the credit risk and market risk component of the risk-based capital requirements will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations in the future.\nStatutory and Regulatory Restrictions on Capital Stock Repurchase and Redemption\nIn accordance with the FHLB Act, our capital stock is considered putable with restrictions given the significant restrictions on the obligation/right to redeem.\nWe cannot redeem shares of stock from any member if:\n \u2022 the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation is not paid in full when due; \n \u2022 we fail to certify in writing to the FHFA that we will remain in compliance with our liquidity requirements and will remain capable of making full and timely payment of all of our current obligations; \n \u2022 we notify the FHFA that we cannot provide the required quarterly certification, or project that we will fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements, or will be unable to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations; or \n \u2022 we actually fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements or to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations, or enter or negotiate to enter into an agreement with one or more other FHLBs to obtain financial assistance to meet our current obligations. \nAdditional statutory and regulatory restrictions on the redemption and repurchase of our capital stock include the following:\n \u2022 In no case may we redeem or repurchase capital stock if, following such redemption, we would fail to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the GLB Act or the FHFA. \n \u2022 In no case may we redeem or repurchase capital stock if either our Board of Directors or the FHFA determines that we have incurred, or are likely to incur, losses resulting or expected to result in a charge against capital stock. In addition to being able to prohibit capital stock redemptions and repurchases, our Board has a right to call for additional capital stock purchases by members, as a condition of continuing membership, as needed for us to satisfy our statutory and regulatory capital requirements. \nThe FHLB Act provides that, in accordance with rules, regulations, and orders that may be prescribed by the FHFA, we may be liquidated or reorganized and our capital stock paid off and retired, in whole or in part, after paying or making a provision for payment of our liabilities. The FHLB Act further provides that, in connection with any such liquidation or reorganization, any other FHLB may, with the approval of the FHFA, acquire our assets and assume our liabilities, in whole or in part.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nCapital Amounts\nThe following tables, respectively, presents our five largest holders of regulatory capital stock and reconciles our capital reported in our statements of condition to the amount of capital stock reported for regulatory purposes.

For details on these changes please see Note 13 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the financial statements.\nAlthough we had no OTTI year to date in 2019, credit deterioration may negatively impact our remaining private label MBS portfolio. We cannot predict if or when impairments will occur, or the impact these impairments may have on our retained earnings and capital position.\nComponents of total GAAP capital changed for the following reasons:\n \u2022 The increase in capital stock corresponds to our members' increased use of our advances to support their borrowings. \n \u2022 Total retained earnings increased due to our net income less dividends paid; see Statements of Capital on page for details. \nBeginning in February 2020, the FHFA will consider the proportion of capital stock to assets, measured on a daily average basis at month end, when assessing each FHLB's capital management practices. See Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13.\nRepurchase of Excess Capital Stock\nBeginning on October 31, 2019, we stopped repurchasing all excess Class B2 membership stock on a weekly basis .However, members may continue to request repurchase of excess stock on any business day. All repurchases of excess capital stock requested by members will continue until otherwise announced, but remain subject to our regulatory requirements, certain financial and capital thresholds, and prudent business practices.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nRepurchase of excess capital stock held by members is subject to compliance with the following financial and capital thresholds both before and after repurchase:\n \u2022 The ratio of our total capital to total assets is greater than or equal to 4.25%; \n \u2022 Our ratio of the Bank's market value of equity to book value of equity is at least 85% on a U.S. GAAP basis; \n \u2022 Our risk-based capital is greater than or equal to 125% of the minimum amount required, as discussed in Capital Resources on page 54; \n \u2022 Compliance with all of our minimum regulatory capital requirements; \n \u2022 Projected compliance with each of our minimum regulatory capital requirements for the next four quarters using the most recent expected case income projections; and \n \u2022 Compliance with our contractual obligations under the Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement, as discussed in Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement with other FHLBs on the next page. \nFor further information on amounts of excess stock repurchased, see Statements of Capital to the financial statements.\nRetained Earnings & Dividends\nDividend Payments\nFHFA rules state that FHLBs may declare and pay dividends only from previously retained earnings or current net earnings, and may not declare or pay dividends based on projected or anticipated earnings. Under our Capital Plan, any dividend declared on Class B1 shares must be greater than or equal to the dividend declared on Class B2 shares for the same period, and dividends may be paid in the form of cash or stock, or a combination of both. All dividends we have paid since 2011 have been in cash rather than stock. We have paid an enhanced dividend on Class B1 activity stock since the fourth quarter of 2013.\nAlthough we continue to work to maintain our financial strength to support a reasonable dividend, any future dividend payment remains subject to declaration by our Board and will depend on future operating results, our Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy, and any other factors the Board determines to be relevant.\nWe may not pay dividends if we fail to satisfy our minimum capital and liquidity requirements under the FHLB Act and FHFA regulations. Further, under FHFA regulations, we may not pay any dividends in the form of capital stock if excess stock held by our shareholders is greater than 1% of our total assets or if, after the issuance of such shares, excess stock held by our shareholders would be greater than 1% of our total assets.\nRetained Earnings and Dividend Policy\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy (Policy) which, as last updated in December 2019, establishes a target for retained earnings to provide a cushion against the potential for loss that could impact shareholder value. Specifically, the Policy requires us to establish an overall target for retained earnings incorporating the following components:\n \u2022 Risk-based targets based on estimates using the greater of (1) modified regulatory-based estimates with components for credit risk and market risk, (2) results of our annual stress test, and (3) parametric value-at-risk estimates for credit and market risk. Each of these risk-based alternatives incorporates additional estimates for exposures related to (a) operational risk, (b) repurchase risk arising from obligations to third party investors from loans originated under the MPF Program, (c) settlement risk relating to unsettled consolidated obligations and investment debt securities, (d) accounting risk related to hedge accounting and OTTI accounting ; (e) counterparty risks relating to risk of loss due to failure of a counterparty in an unsecured transaction; and (f) the amount of loans outstanding under the Bank's Community First Fund; \n \u2022 Earnings-based targets that would allow the Bank to pay a reasonable return on member capital in low-rate and low-member utilization environments; and \n \u2022 Risk-adjusted capital target that would allow the Bank to meet regulatory capital requirements without reliance on risk-based retained earnings under stressful conditions. \nUnder the Policy, we may, but are not required, to pay a dividend out of our net income (with certain adjustments as described below) or retained earnings, after consideration of the retained earnings target on a quarterly basis and management's assessment of the current adequacy of retained earnings. The maximum dividend allowed would align with requirements set forth in the Policy regarding target levels of retained earnings and risk-adjusted capital, and achievement of risk-based targets.The Board may declare a dividend less than the maximum dividend permitted under the Policy. For these purposes, adjusted net income is net income resulting directly from certain business activities, excluding income from such activities as advance prepayments, transfers of debt to other FHLBs and gains or losses resulting from certain hedge practices.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends at annualized percentage rates per $100 of par value as presented in the below table (based on the previous quarter's earnings).\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B1 Activity Stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B2 Membership Stock\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter in which dividend was declared (recorded) and paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1st quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2nd quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3rd quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4th quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1st quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2nd quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3rd quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4th quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn January 23, 2020, our Board of Directors maintained the dividend declared per share on both sub-classes of capital stock. Based on our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019, the Board declared a cash dividend of 5.00% (annualized) for Class B1 activity stock and a cash dividend of 2.25% (annualized) for Class B2 membership stock. This dividend, including dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock (recorded as interest expense), totaled $25 million and was paid on February 13, 2020. As further discussed in Executive Summary on page 35, on January 23, 2020, the Bank also provided dividend guidance for the next two quarters.\nJoint Capital Enhancement Agreement with other FHLBs\nThe FHLBs, including us, entered into a Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement (JCE Agreement) intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLB. The intent of the JCE Agreement is to allocate that portion of each FHLB's earnings to a separate retained earnings account at that FHLB. For more information on the JCE Agreement, see Note 12 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements.\nAlthough restricted retained earnings under the JCE Agreement are included in determining whether we have attained the retained earnings target under the Bank's Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy discussed above, these restricted retained earnings will not be available to pay dividends. We do not believe that the requirement to contribute 20% of our future net income to a restricted retained earnings account under the JCE Agreement will have an impact on our ability to pay dividends except in the most extreme circumstances. There is a provision in the JCE Agreement that if, at any time, our restricted retained earnings were to fall below the required level, we would only be permitted to pay dividends out of (1) current net income not required to be added to our restricted retained earnings and (2) retained earnings that are not restricted.\nFICO Dissolution\nOn October 2019, the Financing Corporation (FICO), formed pursuant to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Recapitalization Act of 1987 to provide financing for the resolution of failed savings and loan associations, commenced the process of dissolution in accordance with relevant statutory requirements and the terms of a plan of dissolution approved by the Director of the FHFA. Subject to the satisfaction of any claims and the payment of other administrative expenses upon FICO's dissolution, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2020, any surplus and remaining cash on hand of FICO is expected to be distributed to the FHLBs, as FICO's sole stockholders, in proportion to their ownership in FICO's nonvoting capital stock. The Bank's ownership in FICO's nonvoting capital stock is 9.69%. The receipt by the Bank of any such distribution from FICO will be treated as a partial return of its prior capital contributions to FICO and credited to its unrestricted retained earnings. The Bank does not expect any distribution from FICO to materially affect the Bank's financial condition or combined results of operations.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe provide members with letters of credit for a fee. If a beneficiary draws under a letter of credit, our member either reimburses us for the amount drawn or the drawn amount is converted into a collateralized advance to the member. If any advances were to be issued under these letters of credit, they would be made under the same standards and terms of collateral as any other advance issued to that member at that point of time.\nWe have entered into standby bond purchase agreements with the Illinois and Wisconsin state housing authorities.

Fraud, legal, compliance, financial reporting, model and technology risks are components within the definition of operational risk. We have established programs to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report operational risks such as comprehensive risk assessments, establishing policies and procedures, loss incident reporting and obtaining appropriate insurance coverage to mitigate the likelihood of, and potential losses from, such occurrences.\nGovernance and Control Activities\nThe Board of Directors has established Bank-wide policies governing operational risk, which include an Enterprise Risk Management Policy and an Enterprise Operational Risk Management Policy. Primary oversight responsibility for operational risk is vested with our management level Operational Risk Oversight Committee. Responsibilities of this committee include, but are not limited to, oversight and review of Bank-wide operational risks such as the management of business continuity, technology (including information security) risks, issues or updates, operational aspects of new business activities, analysis and mitigation of any operational loss, vendor management, oversight and direction to our compliance activities, and oversight to internal controls and procedures in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Committee monitors the performance of these operational activities by reviewing management reports prepared by the responsible business manager on a periodic basis. Also, the Committee monitors the effectiveness of operational controls through the reporting of critical operational losses, events, risk assessments, operational risk metrics, and a quarterly certification of operational and internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur executive officers or their delegates provide periodic reports, as appropriate, to the following Board committees: Risk Management Committee, Operations and Technology Committee, and the Audit Committee.\nBusiness Resiliency\nIn order to ensure our ability to provide liquidity and service to our members and PFIs, we have business resumption plans designed to restore critical business processes and systems in the event of a variety of business interruptions. We maintain key information systems infrastructure with vendors that have reliable and consistent data recovery capabilities as well as more optimal geographic diversity to provide a more resilient technology infrastructure. We are party to a reciprocal arrangement with the FHLB Dallas to allow members to access their deposits as well as have access to overnight advances to the extent they have collateral already in place. Both the FHLB Dallas and our off-site recovery plans are subject to periodic testing.\nCredit Risk\nWe define credit risk as the risk to our earnings or capital due to an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with us, or to otherwise perform as agreed. We are exposed to credit risk principally through:\n \u2022 Member credit products, such as advances, letters of credit, and other extensions of credit to borrowers; \n \u2022 MPF Loans and related exposures; \n \u2022 investment debt securities; \n \u2022 securities purchased under agreements to resell; \n \u2022 unsecured short-term investments; \n \u2022 Community First Fund loans; and \n \u2022 derivatives. \nManaging Our Credit Risk Exposure Related to Member Credit Products\nOur member credit products credit risk exposure includes our secured credit extensions, such as advances, letters of credit, and related extensions of credit to members. See Note 6 - Advances and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements for further details on member credit products. We lend to our members in accordance with federal statutes and FHFA regulations. We manage our credit exposure to our member credit products using a risk-based integrated approach as discussed below. We utilize conservative collateral/lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing members' needs for a reliable source of funding.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nEstablishing Credit Limits - Under our credit policy, a member's initial credit limit is set at 35% of their total assets, subject to modifications up or down based primarily on the following factors:\n \u2022 The collateral value of eligible collateral a member has pledged. Collateral value represents the borrowing capacity assigned to the types of collateral we accept for member credit products. Collateral value does not imply fair value. \n \u2022 A member's risk rating, which is determined by assessing their creditworthiness and financial condition utilizing financial information available to us, including the quarterly financial statement reports members file with their regulators. Additionally, we conduct an ongoing review of each borrower's financial condition. \n \u2022 For increases to the initial credit limit, approval by the Credit and Collateral Committee, our CRO, or our CEO is required. \nMember Credit Outstanding - We track total credit risk with our members. The total credit risk concentrated with members with 10% or more of our total member credit outstanding is as follows:\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Credit Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One Mortgage Partners Corp.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>a\n</td> <td>33.9 %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n a One Mortgage Partners Corp. is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank NA. \nMember Credit Risk Ratings - Our credit risk rating system focuses primarily on our member's overall financial health and takes into account the member's asset quality, earnings, and capital position. We utilize our credit risk rating system to assign each member a credit risk rating from one (lowest credit risk) to five (highest credit risk). Our credit risk rating represents our assessment of the risk of member insolvency rather than the risk of credit loss on the member's credit outstanding with us. We utilize the credit risk rating of a member to manage our credit risk through collateral controls, and as a result, we have never suffered a credit loss on a member credit product. Credit risk mitigation actions may be applied to members perceived to pose increased risk, and are commonly applied to members with credit risk ratings of four and five. Specifically, these members may be:\n \u2022 required to maintain higher amounts of collateral; \n \u2022 required to deliver loan collateral to us or a third party custodian on our behalf; \n \u2022 restricted from obtaining certain member credit products; and \n \u2022 faced with more stringent collateral reporting requirements. \nThe following table presents the number of members and related credit outstanding to them by credit risk rating. Credit outstanding consists primarily of outstanding advances and letters of credit. MPF credit enhancement obligations, member derivative exposures, and other obligations make up the rest. Of the total credit outstanding, $50.1 billion were advances (par value) and $23.9 billion were letters of credit at December 31, 2019, compared to $52.6 billion and $24.3 billion at December 31, 2018.\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Borrowing Members\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Collateral Loan Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Borrowing Members\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Collateral Loan Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of members assigned a 4 rating in the above table were required to submit specific collateral listings and the majority of members assigned a 5 rating were required to deliver collateral to us or to a third party custodian on our behalf.\nNature and Amount of Collateral Pledged - Collateral arrangements may vary by type of member (e.g., depository versus non-depository institutions), lien structure, member credit quality, collateral availability, collateral type, results of periodic on-site reviews of collateral, and overall member credit exposure. The FHLB Act requires us to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure member credit products. Eligible collateral includes whole first mortgages on improved residential property, or non-agency securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages; securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its agencies (includes MBS issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and FHLB consolidated\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nobligations); cash or deposits; and other real estate related collateral (includes home equity loans and lines of credit, farmland, and commercial real estate) that has a readily ascertainable value, can be reliably discounted to account for liquidation risk and can be liquidated in due course and that we can perfect a security interest in such collateral. We also accept pledges of secured business or agri-business loans from community financial institutions (CFIs), which are permitted under the FHLB Act.\nIn certain circumstances, such as when a member's membership is terminated due to a merger and the acquiring entity is a member of another FHLB; the other FHLB may agree to manage the former member's collateral covering advances and any other amounts still outstanding to us and will subordinate to us either certain collateral it receives from the member or certain categories of collateral. Likewise, if one of our members were to acquire the member of another FHLB, we may agree to manage the collateral for the other FHLB and subordinate our security interest in a certain category of collateral.\nOur Advances, Collateral Pledge and Security Agreement requires that a member provide collateral value equal to its credit outstanding (unless we specifically require more for a particular member). The value assigned to securities and loan collateral is calculated as shown below. It should be noted that the applicable percentage margin utilized in the calculation for securities or loans vary based on the type of collateral being pledged, as well as factors (that vary whether the collateral is a security or loan) including model risk, broker fees, market volatility and liquidity, the type of collateral reporting, the member's risk rating, and whether the member is a depository or non-depository.\n \u2022 For securities, we multiply the applicable margin by the market value of each security; and \n \u2022 For loans, we multiply the applicable margin by the unpaid principal balance of pledged loans, along with any applicable percentage applied to adjust for exceptions found during a member's collateral review. \n \u25aa In general members pledging loan collateral via blanket reporting will receive the margins published, as a percent of unpaid principal balance. \n \u25aa Members with listed and/or delivered loan collateral will generally receive the margins published, which will be applied as a percent to the lower of par or market value of the unpaid principal balance of the reported loan collateral. \nControls over Pledged Collateral - We require delivery of all securities collateral and may also require delivery of loan collateral under certain conditions (for example, when a member's credit condition deteriorates).\nThe FHLB Act requires that each advance to a member be fully secured. We are required to obtain and maintain a security interest in collateral securing advances. The FHLB Act provides that any security interest granted to us by our members, or an affiliate of such member, is entitled to priority over the claims and rights of any party, including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor other than claims and rights that would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual bona fide purchasers for value or by actual secured parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests. We perfect the security interests granted to us by members and affiliates by taking possession of securities collateral and by filing UCC-1 financing statements on all other collateral.\nFor depository institutions, we generally require members to pledge collateral under a blanket lien under which our security interest in collateral is automatically released when the member has sold or otherwise transferred its ownership interest in the collateral (unless otherwise notified by us) and such collateral is not required to secure a member's outstanding credit obligations and we have not required the member to list or deliver such collateral. Under the Advances, Collateral Pledge and Security Agreement with our members, a member must maintain collateral with a collateral value to fully cover its credit outstanding. If the collateral does not have collateral value sufficient to cover the credit outstanding, we require a member to pledge other assets as collateral to cover the shortage, this includes the pledging of types of collateral that are outside of our eligibility criteria. As a result, we may require listing or delivery of the additional collateral from the member at any time while there is credit outstanding. Additionally, we have a lien on their capital stock in us.\nThe method by which a member reports collateral is dependent upon the collateral status to which it is assigned, as well as the type of collateral being pledged. In order for a member to have borrowing capacity with us, the member must report its eligible collateral using one of the following methods. Under blanket reporting, a member that has granted us a blanket lien on certain categories of collateral may report the collateral types on a qualified collateral report. For members that list collateral, either by choice or as directed by us, the member must submit a listing of its collateral which includes loan-level detail of the collateral. Securities pledged to us must be delivered to us or an approved third party custodian pursuant to a collateral control agreement. Loan collateral pledged to us may be required to be delivered to an approved third party custodian pursuant to a collateral control agreement. Regardless of the manner in which the collateral is pledged, all members must report their collateral to us at least quarterly.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nWe also conduct periodic on-site loan collateral reviews to confirm the collateral meets our eligibility requirements. On-site collateral verifications are performed on a schedule that varies based upon, including, but not limited to, our assessment of the credit risk of the member, the size of the member's credit exposure, the types of collateral pledged, and the amount of collateral coverage.\nWe have not recorded any allowance for credit losses for our on balance sheet member credit products nor any liabilities for our off balance sheet member credit products in the periods presented based on the following factors:\n \u2022 Our credit outstanding is sufficiently well collateralized as a result of the collateral and credit risk mitigation efforts described above; \n \u2022 Our credit analyses of our members; \n \u2022 The repayment history on member credit products; and \n \u2022 No member credit products that were past due, on nonaccrual status, involved in a troubled debt restructuring, or otherwise considered impaired. \nMPF Loans and Related Exposures\nFor a description of the MPF Program see Mortgage Partnership Finance Program on page 8.\nCredit Risk Exposure - Our credit risk exposure on conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio is the potential for financial loss due to borrower default and depreciation in the value of the real estate collateral securing the MPF Loan, offset by our ability to recover losses from PMI, Recoverable CE Fees, and the CE Amount which may include SMI. The PFI is required to pledge collateral to secure any portion of its CE Amount that is a direct obligation of the PFI. The unpaid principal balances of our conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio exposed to credit losses was $8.9 billion at December 31, 2019, and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Our actual credit exposure is less than these amounts because the borrower's equity, which represents the fair value of underlying property in excess of the outstanding MPF Loan held in portfolio balance, has not been considered.\nOur MPF Loans held in portfolio includes conventional mortgage loans that may be viewed as having greater credit risk because the borrowers have weaker credit histories. The current MPF Program eligibility criteria for conforming conventional MPF Loans excludes loans to borrowers with a FICO score less than 620. Historically, we accepted MPF Loans from borrowers with FICO scores below 620 provided they met the underwriting standards set forth in the MPF Guides, which require compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks (issued October 4, 2006) and the Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending (issued on July 10, 2007) issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of the Thrift Supervision, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration. MPF Loans to borrowers with no FICO scores are also eligible for delivery under the MPF Program provided that acceptable alternate documentation of credit history is provided. We do not classify these MPF Loans internally as subprime\u201d because they are not higher-priced mortgage loans. Mortgages that meet the MPF Program's definition of higher-priced mortgage loans are not eligible for delivery under the MPF Program. MPF Loans with borrowers having no FICO scores or with FICO scores less than 660 represent a relatively small portion of our total conventional MPF Loan portfolio.\nFor MPF Loans, the MPF Program allows for varying levels of documentation with respect to borrower income, and the level of documentation is considered when determining the amount of credit enhancement required for each Master Commitment under the credit model we utilize to set the CE Amount. To date, we have not experienced material differences in loss or delinquency rates based on documentation levels of our conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio.\nUnder the MPF Government MBS product, we must advance the scheduled principal and interest payments to the securities holders of Ginnie Mae MBS that we issued if the servicing PFI defaults on its payment obligations to advance the scheduled remittances. Once MPF Government MBS loans are ninety days delinquent, we have the option to repurchase the mortgage loan out of the security and work with a servicer to mitigate the credit loss.\nSetting Credit Enhancement Levels - For conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio, credit losses in a Master Commitment are first absorbed by the Bank's FLA but, if applicable to the MPF product, we will withhold a PFI's scheduled performance credit enhancement fee in order to reimburse ourselves for any losses allocated to the FLA. If the FLA is exhausted, the credit losses are then absorbed by the PFI's CE Amount that is calculated by utilizing third party credit models. For further details on the FLA and PFI's CE Amount, refer to Loss Structure for Credit Risk Sharing Products on page 9 and Conventional MPF Loans Held in Portfolio on page.\nThe PFI's CE Amount is determined by the Bank, based on documented analysis, that the Bank has a high degree of confidence that it will not bear material losses beyond the losses absorbed by the Bank's FLA, even under reasonably likely adverse changes to expected economic conditions. Loans are assessed by third party credit models at acquisition and a credit\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nenhancement is calculated based on credit attributes of the loans in each Master Commitment. Credit losses on a loan may only be absorbed by the CE Amount in the Master Commitment related to the loan.\nThe CE Amounts and the FLA for certain conventional MPF Products held in our portfolio may be periodically reset lower for each Master Commitment after a required period of seasoning because the amount of credit enhancement necessary to maintain our risk of credit losses within our risk tolerance is usually reduced over time.\nFor the MPF Plus product, the PFI is required to provide an SMI policy covering the MPF Loans in the Master Commitment and having a deductible initially equal to the FLA. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the outstanding balances of MPF Loans under the MPF Plus product with SMI coverage were $148 million and $265 million and the amounts of SMI coverage provided against losses were $9 million and $12 million. The reduction in coverage was due to the resetting of SMI policies as provided in the MPF Plus product structure. Credit losses associated with Master Commitments where the SMI coverage has been discontinued are incorporated into the allowance for credit losses calculation. Such credit losses were immaterial.\nThe following table shows the status of our credit enhancement structure on conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio. Unpaid principal balances in this table include REO, as losses in REO impact, and are impacted by, the credit enhancement structure of a Master Commitment. As defined, the CE Amount includes SMI on the MPF Plus product. Government Loans are excluded from the table as they are not directly credit enhanced by the PFI.\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional MPF Product Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90+ Days Delinquent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>FLA a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PFI's CE Amount b\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.88%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.46%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.22%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.63%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Original\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.43%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.51%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n a For each product above, except MPF Original, a portion of losses experienced at the FLA level may be recovered through the withholding of performance-based CE Fees from PFIs. \n b Credit losses on a loan may only be absorbed by the CE Amount in the Master Commitment related to the loan. For further detail refer to Conventional MPF Loans Held in Portfolio on page. \nConcentration Risks - In conjunction with assessing credit risks on the MPF Loan portfolio, we also assess concentration risks that could negatively impact this portfolio.\nGeographic Concentration - While we have MPF Loans throughout the United States, our largest concentrations of 10% or more of conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio were secured by properties located in the states shown in the following table. Amounts shown are based on outstanding par value. An overall decline in the economy, residential real estate market, or the occurrence of a natural disaster could adversely affect the value of the mortgaged properties in these states and increase the risk of delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy or loss on MPF Loans, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Par Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Illinois\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unpaid principal balance of conventional MPF Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeller Concentration - During 2019, the top five PFIs, in the aggregate, accounted for 44% of our MPF Loans purchased and held in portfolio on our balance sheet. To the extent we lose our business with these PFIs and cannot attract comparable replacements, our business may be adversely affected.\nFor further discussion of how concentration risks may affect us, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nMortgage Repurchase Risk - We are exposed to mortgage repurchase risk in connection with our sale of MPF Loans to Fannie Mae under the MPF Xtra product, to third party investors under the MPF Direct Product, and to Ginnie Mae for MPF Loans securitized in Ginnie Mae MBS if a loan eligibility requirement or other warranty is breached. We may require the PFI from which\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nwe purchased the ineligible MPF Loan to repurchase that loan from us or indemnify us for related losses or request indemnification from the PFI's MPF Bank as further discussed in the Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nOur mortgage repurchase liability is an estimate of our losses associated with all mortgage loans previously sold in connection with the MPF Xtra, MPF Direct, and MPF Government MBS products for which a breach of representation or warranty has occurred. We consider factors based predominantly on our historical repurchase experience and only include mortgage loans for which we deem it probable that we will be required to either repurchase the mortgage loan or indemnify the applicable third party for losses. This assessment is primarily made during our quality assurance review process. Our estimate incorporates our experiences with third party repurchase demands, PFIs' historical ability to cure repurchase demands, and an assumed loss severity given default.\nThe methodology to estimate the associated mortgage repurchase liability for MPF Government MBS loans also considers potential repurchases based on delinquency activity or lack of final loan certifications within issued pools. We are expected to maintain delinquency rates on outstanding issuances below key thresholds and fulfill operational requirements published by Ginnie Mae.\nWe accrue a mortgage repurchase liability with an offsetting charge to noninterest expense when it is probable and reasonably estimable that we will be obligated to repurchase a loan or indemnify an investor.\nBased on the above factors:\nWe recognized a mortgage repurchase liability of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2019, and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2018, on the MPF Xtra loans. We also recognized an offsetting receivable due from our PFIs, since we deem it probable that we will recover any losses from third parties (e.g., PFIs and other MPF Banks). We believe the estimate of reasonably possible losses is zero as of the end of this reporting period.\nWe have repurchased $8 million of unpaid principal balances related to mortgage loans sold as part of our off balance sheet MPF Loan products for the year ending December 31, 2019, compared to $9 million for 2018, and $4 million for 2017. These repurchases represent repurchase requests that have been resolved during the reporting period. Due to recoveries from PFIs, we incurred no material losses on these loans.\nWe have $18 million as of December 31, 2019, of unpaid principal with respect to MPF Xtra loans that represent unresolved claims with Fannie Mae, in which a repurchase demand may occur compared to $24 million at December 31, 2018; see Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements.\nAdditionally, PFIs are required to repurchase ineligible MPF Loans held in our portfolio unless we either require the PFI to indemnify us or decide to continue to hold such loans in our portfolio. The PFI repurchase requirement is a factor in determining our allowance for credit losses. If a PFI is unable to repurchase ineligible MPF Loans or indemnify us, we would incur a loss to the extent a credit loss is not recovered from collateral provided by the PFI or, alternatively, from the FDIC. In this regard, we have not recorded an allowance for credit losses related to MPF Loans held in our portfolio, as we do not expect to incur any losses after factoring in our recovery claims from PFIs.\nWe record allowances for credit losses for MPF Loans held in portfolio based on available information of past events and the current economic conditions existing as of the date of our statements of condition. Such information includes, but is not limited to, delinquency rates, loss severities, and prepayment speeds consistent with the percentages of delinquent, nonaccrual, and impaired MPF Loans to total conventional MPF Loans. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the financial statements for details on our charge-off policy. Additionally, refer to Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses to the financial statements for further details on our allowance for credit losses.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nFive year trend in our MPF Loans held in portfolio\nThe following table shows the five year trend in our MPF Loans held in portfolio.\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded investment as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPF Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual MPF Loans including nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDR)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TDRs performing - on an accrual basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on original terms (nonaccrual loans/performing TDRs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest recognized (performing TDRs only) b\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses charged to the allowance c\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (reversal of) credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n a Includes loans which are well-secured and in the process of collection.

Our complaints assert claims for untrue or misleading statements in the sale of securities, and it is possible that the classifications of private label MBS, as well as other statements made about the securities by the issuer, are inaccurate. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings on page 30 for details on this litigation.\nIn the following tables, we classify our private label MBS as prime, subprime, or Alt-A based upon the nature of the majority of underlying mortgages collateralizing each security based on the issuer's classification, or as published by an NRSRO, at the time of issuance of the MBS.\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Majority of Underlying Mortgage Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Description of Mortgage Loans Underlying the Security and Security Features\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage loans meet the criteria of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac and the securities have credit protection in the form of a guarantee from the U.S. government in the case of Ginnie Mae, or a guarantee from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prime Fixed Rate/ Adjustable Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First-lien mortgage loans that typically conform to prime\u201d credit guidelines described above, but with a balance that exceeds the maximum allowed under programs sponsored by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest First - Prime Fixed/Adjustable Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage loans typically conform to traditional prime\u201d credit guidelines described above, but may allow for principal deferment for a specified period of time.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternative Documentation Fixed/Adjustable Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage loans generally conform to traditional prime\u201d credit guidelines described above, although the LTV ratio, loan documentation, occupancy status, property type, loan size, or other factors causes the loan not to qualify under standard underwriting programs.

presenting the aging of our investments for the current year, as well as the carrying amounts for the previous two years can be found in Note 5 - Investment Debt Securities to the financial statements. It also discloses the yields by aging categories for the current year.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis - Mortgage Backed Securities\nSignificant Inputs Used to Determine OTTI\nWe assess an HTM or AFS private label MBS security for OTTI whenever its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis as of the reporting date. Specifically, we generate cash flow projections utilizing key modeling assumptions, significant inputs, and methodologies provided by an FHLB System OTTI Committee, which was formed by the FHLBs to achieve consistency among the FHLBs in their OTTI analyses for private label MBS. We then utilize these cash flow projections to determine OTTI on our private label MBS; however, we are still responsible for making our own OTTI determination, which includes determining the reasonableness of assumptions, significant inputs, and methodologies used, and performing the required present value calculations using appropriate historical cost bases and yields.\nCash Flow Analysis\nWe perform a cash flow analysis for substantially all of these private label securities utilizing two models provided by independent third parties as described below,\n \u2022 First model. This model considers borrower characteristics and the particular attributes of the loans underlying the securities, in conjunction with assumptions about future changes in home prices and interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, and loss severities. A significant input to the first model is the forecast of future housing price changes for the relevant states and core based statistical areas (CBSAs), which are based upon an assessment of the individual housing markets. \n \u2022 Second model. This model uses the month-by-month projections of future loan performance derived from the first model and allocates the projected loan level cash flows and losses to the various security classes in the securitization structure in accordance with its prescribed cash flow and loss allocation rules. \nWe had no OTTI charge for the year ended December 31, 2019, under a base case (best estimate) scenario. We also performed a cash flow analysis for each of these securities under a more stressful scenario, or adverse case scenario. This adverse case scenario was primarily based on a short-term housing price forecast that was five percentage points lower than the base case, followed by a path with annual rates of housing price growth that included rates which were 33.0% lower than the base case. Based on the adverse scenario, we would not have had a material OTTI charge.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOther Credit Indicators:\nThe following table presents the outstanding unpaid principal balance and credit ratings on our private label residential MBS by Prime, Alt-A, and Subprime as designated at time of issuance.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are secured by collateral of marketable securities held by a third party custodian. If the fair value of the accepted collateral decreases below the fair value amount required as collateral, our counterparty is required to provide an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral to make up the shortfall. If the credit markets experience disruptions, it may increase the likelihood that one of our counterparties could experience liquidity or financial constraints that may cause them to become insolvent or otherwise default on their obligations to us. If the collateral's fair value amount has decreased below the resale agreement's carrying amount, we may suffer a credit loss.\nThe credit ratings of securities purchased under agreement to resell are disclosed along with investment debt securities and unsecured short-term investments, in the Investment Debt Securities by Rating table on page 68.\nUnsecured Short Term Investments\nWe invest in unsecured short-term investments in order to ensure the availability of funds to meet members' credit and liquidity needs. We have credit risk exposure from our unsecured short-term investment portfolio, which may consist of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and Federal Funds sold. We have established the following policies and procedures to limit and monitor our unsecured credit risk exposure.\n \u2022 Eligible counterparties for short-term investments are: \n \u25aa other FHLBs; \n \u25aa other U.S. GSEs; and \n \u25aa FDIC-insured financial institutions, including U.S. subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks, or U.S. branches of foreign commercial banks whose most recently published financial statements exhibit at least $250 million of Tier 1 (or total) \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\ncapital. Foreign banks shall be domiciled in a country whose sovereign rating is at least \"Aa3\" from Moody's or AA- from Standard & Poor's unless otherwise approved by the Bank's Credit and Collateral Committee, Chief Risk Officer or President.\n \u2022 Our unsecured credit exposures to U.S. branches or agency offices of foreign commercial banks include the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, the counterparty may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Our unsecured credit exposures to domestic counterparties and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks include the risk that these counterparties have extended credit to foreign counterparties. \n \u2022 Unsecured credit investment maturities are subject to maximum amounts and tenors as established by the Bank. \n \u2022 We actively monitor our credit risk exposure and the credit quality of each counterparty, including an assessment of each counterparty's financial performance, capital adequacy, sovereign support (if applicable) and the current market perceptions of the counterparty. General macro-economic, political and market conditions may also be considered when deciding on unsecured exposure. As a result of this monitoring activity, we may limit or terminate existing unsecured credit exposure limits. \nThe following table presents the credit ratings of our unsecured investment counterparties, organized by the domicile of the counterparty or, where the counterparty is a U.S. branch or agency office of a foreign commercial bank, by the domicile of the counterparty's parent. This table does not reflect the foreign sovereign government's credit rating. The unsecured investment credit exposure presented in the table may not reflect the average or maximum exposure during the period as the table reflects only the balances at period end.\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A rated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal Funds sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign commercial banks - Federal Funds sold:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finland\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>France\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Netherlands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Norway\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Switzerland\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unsecured credit exposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll $9.036 billion of the unsecured credit exposure in the above table represent overnight investments and $425 million in the above table were with members and their affiliates.

For 2018, net interest income was $513 million, which included $32 million of income from AFS investment security prepayments during the period. The decrease in net interest income for 2019 was primarily the result of the decrease in the AFS prepayment fees. \n \u2022 Noninterest income increased by $84 million to $100 million in 2019 compared to $16 million in 2018, primarily due to instruments held under fair value option, which increased by $54 million, from a loss of $19 million in 2018 to a gain of $35 million in 2019. Net gains on trading securities and derivatives increased $24 million combined from 2018 to 2019. \n \u2022 Noninterest expense was $223 million for 2019 compared to $191 million for 2018, primarily driven by an increase in employee compensation and benefits, and planned operating expenses related to information technology and business resiliency. \n \u2022 Total assets were $99.8 billion at year-end 2019 compared to $92.9 billion at year-end 2018, due to strong growth in liquidity assets to continue to meet the needs of members during all economic cycles, along with MPF Loan growth. \n \u2022 Total investment securities increased 8% in 2019 to $23.1 billion, as we increased our purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. \n \u2022 Retained earnings were $3.8 billion at year-end 2019, up from $3.5 billion at year-end 2018, and we remained in compliance with all of our regulatory capital requirements as of year-end 2019. \nSummary and Outlook\nMember Product and Program Use\nIn 2019, 84% of our member institutions used at least one of our core product offerings-advances, letters of credit, or MPF Program products-or participated in our competitive AHP or DPP Programs. Below is a recap of member product and program use in 2019.\n \u2022 Advances outstanding: At year-end 2019, 366 members had advances of $50.5 billion, down 4% from year-end 2018. \n \u2022 Letters of Credit: At year-end 2019, 211 members had letters of credit outstanding of $23.9 billion, down 2% from year-end 2018. \n \u2022 MPF Loans outstanding: At year-end 2019, MPF Loans outstanding on our balance sheet were $10.0 billion, up 41% from year-end 2018. \n \u2022 Competitive AHP: In 2019, $27.7 million was awarded through our competitive AHP to help finance 50 affordable housing projects consisting of 2,671 housing units located primarily in Illinois and Wisconsin. \n \u2022 DPP: In 2019, 192 members reserved more than $19.5 million in DPP grants on behalf of 3,421 homebuyers in member communities. \nReducing the Cost of Advances with the Activity Stock Dividend\nBased on our preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019, on January 23, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Bank declared a dividend of 5.00% (annualized) for Class B1 activity stock and a dividend of 2.25% (annualized) for Class B2 membership stock, maintaining the levels declared for the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, based on current projections and assumptions about the Bank's financial condition and the economic outlook, the Bank expects to maintain a 5.00% (annualized) level of dividend for Class B1 activity stock for the first and second quarters of 2020. The Bank continues to work to support a reliable dividend on its stock, but any future dividend payment remains subject to determination and declaration by the Board of Directors and may be impacted by a change in financial or economic conditions, regulatory and statutory limitations, and any other relevant factors. We maintained rates on both dividends in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in the forward guidance even as the Federal Reserve reduced rates, providing additional value to all of our members. For additional discussion of risks that may impact the Bank's dividend payments, see the Risk Factors section starting on page 18.\nThe Bank plans to continue to share dividend guidance as we have since the third quarter of 2019, subject to quarterly evaluation by the Board of Directors. We use the activity stock dividend as one way in which members receive value from their membership as it rewards members that support the entire cooperative by borrowing from the Bank.\nOn October 31, 2019, we discontinued the automatic weekly repurchase of excess stock. This change enables members to retain excess stock which, for many members, simplifies managing stock balances and provides a dividend benefit on the excess stock. Members can request repurchases of their excess stock at any time.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nExpanding Member Borrowing Capacity and Accepting of eNotes as Collateral\nThis past July, changes were implemented to maximize member collateral value and support member borrowing capacity. The Bank's collateral eligibility guidelines were updated to provide value for previously ineligible collateral categories, such as special purpose commercial real estate, and provide partial value for various loan attributes that previously rendered collateral as ineligible. These enhancements led to a significant increase in member collateral capacity. As we look ahead to this year and how we will continue to expand member collateral capacity and make borrowing easy, we have been developing a solution with the other FHLBs to accept eNotes as collateral. We anticipate the acceptance of eNotes as collateral becoming available for members later this year.\nSharing Legislative News from the District\nIn November 2019, with substantial help from the Wisconsin Bankers Association, and the support of the Wisconsin Credit Union League, legislation was enacted in Wisconsin eliminating the restriction on the amount of collateral that Wisconsin state banks can pledge when borrowing from an FHLB and removed the 20 year limit on advances to state banks from an FHLB. This change allows Wisconsin members to better manage borrowing capacity.\nPreparing for the LIBOR Transition\nThroughout 2019, the financial markets continued preparing for the anticipated phase-out of the LIBOR by the end of 2021. Acknowledging the importance of this transition, we are working to prepare for the transition. For further discussion, see LIBOR Transition on page 49.\nDelivering an Exceptional Member Experience\nAs a cooperative, we are dedicated to delivering the highest value to our members and providing a seamless borrowing experience when transacting with the Bank. This past year was an exciting time of discovery as cross-department teams identified how we can enhance member borrowing experience to reduce processing time, enhance eBanking, and expand the products available to transact online. Toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, members will see these enhancements when conducting business with us through eBanking. We look forward to developing ways to improve member borrowing experience through new and more intuitive technology.\nBecoming a Leader in Diversity and Inclusion\nThe Bank recognizes the communities members serve in Illinois and Wisconsin are becoming increasingly diverse and we believe our Bank should reflect the diverse perspectives of our members and offer products and services tailored to the communities our members serve. Our commitment to make our Bank a leader in diversity and inclusion led the Board of Directors, Executive Team, and a group of our employees to attend our second Cultural Exploration this past November in Chicago's Latino communities.\nCultural Explorations are just one of the ways the Bank is creating a diverse and inclusive culture. The Bank's CEO recently signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge; this pledge has been taken by over 800 CEOs across the nation who believe diverse teams and inclusive behaviors are essential to a strong organization. We are joined together on a commitment to enhance diversity and inclusion in our organizations, share best practices, and participate in a Day of Understanding.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nInvesting in Members' Communities\nDeepening our support of our members' local communities through products, programs, and awards that drive economic development, expand capacity and lending capital, rebuild after natural disasters, and support community leaders is central to our mission. Here is a recap of those efforts in 2019.\n \u2022 Community Small Business Advance: The Community Small Business Advance enables our members to support their local economy and community revitalization efforts in income-eligible communities. In 2019, $1.5 million in interest-rate subsidy was reserved, representing $14.4 million in anticipated lending to small businesses. \n \u2022 Community First Capacity-Building Grant Program: In 2019, more than $250,000 was awarded through the Community First Capacity-Building Grant Program. These grants help participating members strengthen a nonprofit lender's financial position, operational efficiency, and/or human capital in support of their economic development and affordable housing activities in Illinois and Wisconsin. \n \u2022 Community First Disaster Relief Program: In 2019, we committed $500,000 in response to FEMA-declared disasters in Illinois and Wisconsin. Since the program's inception in 2013, we have awarded over $1.5 million in disaster relief funding. \n \u2022 Community First Fund: We committed $47.5 million of the $50 million revolving Community First Fund by year-end 2019 as part of our ongoing effort to directly fund community development financial institutions and community development loan funds. \n \u2022 Community First Awards: In 2019, we awarded $40,000 in Community First Awards to recognize outstanding achievements of our members and their local partners in the communities they serve. Award recipients included an innovative home loan program, leaders in affordable housing and sustainable homeownership, and a development that revitalized a neighborhood through affordable housing and economic development. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards to the financial statements for further details.\nEstimating Fair Value\nSee Note 15 - Fair Value to the financial statements for further details.\nControls over Internal Valuation Methodologies and Third Party Pricing Vendors\nSegregation of duties is a key control over our internal valuation methodologies and third party pricing vendors. In this regard, our segregation of duties are outlined below.\n \u2022 Senior management is responsible for our valuation policies. Senior management's responsibility is independent of our investing and treasury functions. \n \u2022 The Asset/Liability Management Committee approves fair value policies and reviews the appropriateness of current valuation methodologies and policies. Model validation is overseen by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. \n \u2022 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the remediation of gaps in models identified as a result of our governance process. \n \u2022 The Risk Management Group prepares the fair value measurements of our financial instruments, evaluates the appropriateness of the fair values generated by pricing models, and assures the reasonableness and consistent application of valuation approaches and assumptions utilized in cases where unobservable inputs are utilized. In addition, the group performs control processes to ensure the fair values received from third party pricing services are consistent with GAAP fair value measurement guidance. \n \u2022 The Risk Management Group's responsibility is independent of our investing and treasury management functions. \nOther control processes over our internal valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Reviewing the pricing model's theoretical soundness and appropriateness by personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the fair value measurement function. \n \u2022 Back testing models to subsequent transactions (e.g. termination of a derivative), analysis of actual cash flows to projected cash flows, comparisons with similar observable positions, and comparisons with information received from pricing services for financial instruments where prices or valuations require unobservable inputs. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOther control processes over third party pricing vendors, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Understanding and evaluating the fair value measurements received on each major investment security type to ensure that the amounts reported in our financial statements as well as our fair value disclosures comply with GAAP. \n \u2022 Utilizing all fair value inputs received from multiple third party pricing vendors to determine the fair value of an individual security unless we determine that exclusion of a fair value input is appropriate based on our control processes. \n \u2022 Discussions with our third party pricing vendors to ensure that they are in compliance with fair value measurement guidance under GAAP. Such discussions focus on the following: \n \u25aa Understanding their pricing models to the extent possible, as some pricing models are proprietary in nature. \n \u25aa Understanding the principal or most advantageous market selected and our ability to access that market. \n \u25aa Assumptions and significant inputs used in determining the fair value measurement. \n \u25aa The appropriateness of the fair value hierarchy level as of the reporting date. \n \u25aa Whether the market was active or illiquid as of the reporting date. \n \u25aa Whether transactions were between willing buyers and sellers or distressed in nature as of the reporting date. \n \u25aa Whether the fair value measurements as of the reporting date is based on current or stale assumptions and inputs. \n \u2022 Obtaining the third party pricing vendor methodologies and control reports. \n \u2022 Challenging fair value measurements received that represent outliers to the fair value measurements received on the same financial instrument from a different third party pricing service. We document these challenges on a monthly basis. \n \u2022 Examining the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities across asset classes and average life. \n \u2022 Identifying stale prices, prices changed significantly from prior valuations, and other anomalies that may indicate that a price may not be accurate. \n \u2022 Performing implied yield analysis to identify anomalies. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between the amount we recognize into interest income on our interest earning assets and the amount we recognize into interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities. These amounts were determined in accordance with GAAP and were based on the underlying contractual interest rate terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as the following items:\n \u2022 Amortization of premiums; \n \u2022 Accretion of discounts and credit OTTI reversals; \n \u2022 Beginning January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis, hedge ineffectiveness, which represents the difference between changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the related change in fair value of the hedged item is recognized into either interest income or interest expense, whichever is appropriate. For cash flow hedges, recognition occurs only when amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. Such recognition occurs when earnings are affected by the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, hedge ineffectiveness was classified in noninterest income on derivatives and hedging activities; \n \u2022 Net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges; \n \u2022 Amortization of fair value and cash flow closed hedge adjustments; \n \u2022 Advance and investment prepayment fees; and \n \u2022 MPF credit enhancement fees.  The following table presents the increase or decrease in interest income and expense due to volume or rate variances. The calculation of these components includes the following considerations:\n \u2022 Average Balance: Average balances are calculated using daily balances. Amortized cost basis is used to compute the average balances for most of our financial instruments, including MPF Loans held in portfolio that are on nonaccrual status and available-for-sale debt securities. Fair value is used to compute average balances for our trading debt securities and financial instruments carried at fair value under the fair value option. \n \u2022 Total Interest: Total interest includes the net interest income components, as discussed above, applicable to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. \n \u2022 Yield/Rate: Effective yields/rates are based on total interest and average balances as defined above. Yields/rates are calculated on an annualized basis. The calculation of the yield on our available-for-sale securities does not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). \n \u2022 The change in volume is calculated as the change in average balance multiplied by the current year yield. The change in rate is calculated as the change in yield multiplied by the prior year average balance. Any changes due to the combined volume/rate variance have been allocated to volume. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\n2019 compared to 2018\nFor comparisons to 2017 see Net Interest Income on page 41 in our 2018 Form 10-K.\n\n a Adjusted net yield on interest bearing assets is on a non-GAAP basis, calculated the same as net yield on interest bearing assets, but excluding AFS prepayment fees from net interest income. The prepayment fees on our AFS investments are unpredictable and we cannot be certain of the timing or amount of future prepayments (see Note 4 - Interest Income and Interest Expense for details). Accordingly, we believe that the use of adjusted net yield is useful in evaluating our ongoing operational and financial results in a manner that is consistent with our evaluation of business performance. \n \u2022 Interest income from investment debt securities increased due to increases in volume as purchases exceeded paydowns and maturities. Subject to FHFA regulatory limits as discussed in Investments on page 10, we resumed making investments in MBS in June 2018. \n \u2022 Interest income from advances increased due to higher interest rates, primarily as a result of advances borrowed during a period of rising market interest rates despite market interest rates declining overall in 2019. \n \u2022 Interest income from MPF Loans held in portfolio increased due to higher volumes, as new MPF loan purchases continued to outpace paydown and maturity activity due mainly to refinancing and loan origination activity as mortgage rates have declined. In addition, increased utilization by PFIs and the addition of new PFIs from our Bank to the MPF Program continue to contribute to higher volume in our MPF Loans held in portfolio. The increase in interest income due to volume was somewhat offset by the decline in interest income on MPF Loans held in portfolio that are being replaced by lower rate loans. \n \u2022 Interest income from overnight Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell increased primarily due to higher overall short term market interest rates in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 despite market interest rates declining overall in 2019. \n \u2022 Interest expense on our shorter termed consolidated obligation discount notes increased due to higher volume and interest rates. We issued additional consolidated obligation discount notes to fund demand for our advances and other assets. Interest rates increased due to higher overall short term market interest rates in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 despite market interest rates declining in 2019. \n \u2022 Interest expense on our longer termed consolidated obligation bonds increased primarily due to higher interest rates, as the bonds were issued during a period of rising market interest rates despite market interest rates declining overall in 2019.  For details of the effect our fair value and cash flow hedge activities had on our net interest income see the following page.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\n \nNoninterest income\nFor comparisons to 2017 see Noninterest Income on pages 43 and 44 in our 2018 Form 10-K.\n\nTrading Securities, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, and Instruments Held Under Fair Value Option\nUnrealized gains in instruments held under the fair value option was the most significant driver of our increase in noninterest income. Net gains in our trading securities and derivatives and hedging activities also contributed to our increase in noninterest income. The corresponding net gains in 2019 compared to 2018 were primarily attributable to the decline in market interest rates in 2019.\nThe following table details the effect of these transactions on our statements of income.\n\nMPF fees (including from other FHLBs)\nA majority of MPF fees are from other FHLBs that pay us a fixed membership fee to participate in the MPF Program and a\nvolume based fee for us to provide services related to MPF Loans carried on their balance sheets. MPF fees also include\nincome from other third party off balance sheet MPF Loan products and other related transaction fees. These fees are designed\nto compensate us for the expenses we incur to administer the program. MPF fees have grown as MPF Loan volume has increased as noted in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nOther, net\nOther, net consists primarily of fee income we earn from member standby letters of credit products, as noted in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nNoninterest Expense\nFor comparisons to 2017 see Noninterest Expense on page 44 in our 2018 Form 10-K.\n\nThe following analysis and comparisons apply to the periods presented in the above table.\nAs noted in Noninterest Income on page 42, we earn MPF fees from the MPF Program, a majority of which are from\nother FHLBs but also include income from other third party investors. These fees are designed to offset the\nexpenses we incur to administer the program. Our expenses relating to the MPF fees earned are included in the relevant line\nitems in the noninterest expense table shown above. The following table summarizes MPF related fees and expenses.\n\nCompensation and benefits\nCompensation and benefits increased due to increased employee headcount and increases in salaries and incentive compensation expenses. We had 488 employees as of December 31, 2019, compared to 468 as of December 31, 2018.\nNonpayroll operating expenses\nOperating expenses increased primarily due to a planned investment in information technology, specifically applications,\ninfrastructure and business resiliency.\nOther\nOther consists primarily of our share of the funding for the FHFA, our regulator, and the Office of Finance, which manages our consolidated obligation debt issuances. These costs were $12 million and $10 million for 2019 and 2018. Other also includes MPF related non-operating expenses and offsetting gains on the sale of real estate owned.\nAssessments\nWe record the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) assessment expense at a rate of 10% of income before assessments, excluding interest expense on MRCS. See Note 11 - Affordable Housing Program to the financial statements for further details.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nFor comparisons to 2017 see Other Comprehensive Income on page 45 in our 2018 Form 10-K.\n\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale debt securities\nThe net unrealized loss on our available-for-sale (AFS) portfolio for 2019 is attributable to the reversal of net unrealized gains\nfrom prior reporting periods as these securities approach maturity (since we expect to receive par value at maturity). The smaller\nunrealized loss during 2019 compared to 2018 resulted from decreases in market interest rates for 2019. The unrealized gain balance remaining in AOCI is expected to reverse over the remaining life of these securities.\nNoncredit OTTI on held-to-maturity debt securities\nWe recorded unrealized noncredit impairments on held-to-maturity debt securities during the last financial crisis. As the market has recovered and because we intend to hold these securities to maturity, we are recording accretion to the carrying amount of the securities, reversing the remaining loss balance in AOCI over the remaining life of these securities.\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges\nThe net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges for 2019 compared to 2018 resulted from a decrease in overall market interest rates for 2019.\nPostretirement plans\nThe gain recorded in 2019 primarily is related to the difference between actual experience and that expected based on actuarial assumptions attributable to our post-retirement supplemental defined benefit equalization plan. A portion of the effect will be amortized into earnings over the plan's average employment period remaining before retirement. We do not expect the amount to be amortized to be material to our results of operations.\nWe have not recognized any instrument-specific credit risk in our statements of comprehensive income due to changes in our credit rating. For further details on the activity in our Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) see Note 13 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the financial statements.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nStatements of Condition\n\nCash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits, Federal Funds sold, and securities purchased under agreements to resell\nAmounts held in these typically overnight accounts will vary each day based on the following:\n \u2022 Interest rate spreads between Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and our debt; \n \u2022 Liquidity requirements; \n \u2022 Counterparties available; and \n \u2022 Collateral availability on securities purchased under agreements to resell. \nIn response to regulatory guidance, we increased our liquid assets in 2019 in order to maintain the liquidity recommended to support anticipated member demand for advances and letters of credit.\nInvestment Debt Securities\nInvestment debt securities slightly increased due to purchases in our trading, AFS, and HTM securities portfolio in 2019. This\nincrease was offset by declines in our trading, AFS, and HTM securities portfolios that matured or paid down. We resumed making investments in MBS securities starting in June 2018, as noted in Results of Operations on page 40.\nAdvances\nAdvance balances declined slightly at December 31, 2019 compared to year end 2018. Advance balances will vary based primarily on member demand or need for wholesale funding and the underlying cost of the advance to the member. While advance demand remained strong during 2019, it is possible that member demand for our advances could decline further in future periods should their funding needs change, or to the extent they elect alternative funding resources. In addition, as our advances with captive insurance companies mature, our total advance levels may decrease. See Risk Factor starting on page 18 for details regarding captive insurance companies.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table sets forth the current period par amount of advances outstanding for the five largest advance borrowers:\n\n a One Mortgage Partners Corp. is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank NA. \nThe following table presents outstanding advances by type of institution. Former members may withdraw from membership or merge with out-of-district institutions but continue to hold advances.\n\nMPF Loans Held in Portfolio, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses\nMPF Loans held in portfolio increased as new-purchase volume continued to outpace paydown and maturity activity due mainly\nto refinancing and loan origination activity as mortgage rates have declined. In addition, increased utilization by PFIs and the\naddition of new PFIs from our Bank to the MPF Program continue to contribute to higher volume in our MPF Loans held in portfolio. In\naddition to our MPF Loans held in portfolio, we have MPF off-balance sheet products, where we buy and concurrently resell MPF\nLoans to Fannie Mae or other third party investors or pool and securitize them into Ginnie Mae MBS. See MPF Program Overview on page 8 for details.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nLiquidity, Funding, & Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe establish our liquidity position primarily based on the factors outlined below.\n \u2022 FHFA regulations and guidance. \n \u2022 Policies established by our Board of Directors. \n \u2022 Member demand for short- and long-term funds. \n \u2022 Maturing consolidated obligations as well as obligations arising from our normal operating activities. \nWe seek to be in a position to meet our members' credit and liquidity needs without maintaining excessive holdings of low-yielding liquid investments or being forced to incur unnecessarily high borrowing costs.\nLiquidity from Investments\nOur sources of liquidity from investments are short-term liquid assets, primarily overnight Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Our ability to utilize these investments for liquidity purposes may be affected if the credit markets experience disruptions, as discussed below.\n \u2022 Our ability to use Federal Funds sold is restricted under our current policy and FHFA regulations. Specifically, we restrict these investments to short maturities and eligible counterparties as discussed in Unsecured Short Term Investments on page 70 because such investments are unsecured. If the credit markets experience disruptions, and as a result one of our counterparties became insolvent or otherwise defaulted on their obligation to us, these investments would not satisfy our liquidity needs and we may incur a credit loss. \n \u2022 Securities purchased under agreements to resell are secured by marketable securities held by a third party custodian. If the credit markets experience disruptions, and as a result one of our counterparties became insolvent or otherwise defaulted on their obligations to us, these investments would not satisfy our liquidity needs if the collateral pledged to secure those obligations has decreased in value. In such cases, we also may suffer a credit loss. See Investment Debt Securities by Rating on page 68 for further discussion and a summary of counterparty credit ratings for these investments. \nOther sources of liquidity from investing activities include trading debt securities, maturing advances, and maturing MPF Loans.\nLiquidity from Debt\nOur source of liquidity from debt is the issuance of new consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes.\nLiquidity Measures\nWe use different measures of liquidity as follows:\nOvernight Liquidity - Our overnight liquidity requirement is established by our Asset/Liability Committee. Currently, our Asset/Liability Management Policy (ALM Policy) requires us to maintain overnight liquid assets at least equal to 3.5% of total assets. Under our ALM Policy, overnight liquidity includes money market assets, Federal Funds sold, deposits, paydowns of advances, MPF Loans with one day to maturity, and inter FHLB loans with one day to maturity. As of December 31, 2019, our overnight liquidity was $20.4 billion or 20.4% of total assets. This amount represents excess overnight liquidity of $16.9 billion over the minimum threshold of 3.5% of total assets.\nDeposit Coverage - To support our member deposits, FHFA regulations require us to have an amount equal to the current deposits received from our members invested in obligations of the U.S. government, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, or advances with maturities not exceeding five years. As of December 31, 2019, we had excess liquidity of $56.5 billion to support member deposits.\nContingency Liquidity - For 2019, FHFA regulations required us to maintain enough contingency liquidity to meet our liquidity needs for five business days without access to the debt market (the \"Contingency Liquidity Regulation\"). Contingent liquidity is defined as: (a) marketable assets with a maturity of one year or less; (b) self-liquidating assets with a maturity of seven days or less; (c) assets that are generally accepted as collateral in the repurchase agreement market; and (d) irrevocable lines of credit from financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality. Our ALM Policy defines our liquidity needs for five business days as an amount equal to the total of all principal and interest payments on non-deposit liabilities coming due in the next five business days plus a reserve consisting of one-fourth of customer deposits and $1.0 billion. Our net liquidity in excess of our total uses and reserves over a cumulative five-business-day period was $31.3 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOn August 23, 2018, the FHFA issued new guidance on liquidity (the Liquidity AB\u201d) that communicates the FHFA's expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the FHLBs to fund advances and letters of credit for members during a sustained capital markets disruption. In connection with the Liquidity AB, the FHFA also issued a supervisory letter that identifies initial applicable thresholds for certain measures identified in the Liquidity AB. As market conditions warrant, the FHFA may update its supervisory letter to identify new thresholds within the ranges set forth in the Liquidity AB. The Liquidity AB replaces the previous FHFA guidance that required us to maintain daily liquidity through short-term investments in an amount at least equal to our anticipated cash outflows under two different scenarios. Additionally, in light of the Liquidity AB, the Contingency Liquidity Regulation discussed above was rescinded on January 1, 2020, when the FHFA\u2018s amendments to its risk-based capital requirements for the FHLBs became effective (as discussed in Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13).\nThe Liquidity AB requires that: (i) we hold positive cash flow assuming no access to the capital markets for an increased period of between ten to thirty calendar days and assuming renewal of all maturing advances, and (ii) we maintain liquidity reserves between one and 20 percent of our outstanding letter of credit commitments. The Liquidity AB implements a phased-in compliance approach with its guidance; with the full measurement period becoming effective on December 31, 2019.\nTo satisfy our current liquidity requirements, we generally maintain increased balances in short-term investments. Depending on market conditions, the Liquidity AB may require the Bank to hold an additional amount of liquid assets, which could reduce the Bank's ability to invest in higher-yielding assets, and may in turn negatively impact net interest income. To the extent that the Bank adjusts pricing for its short-term advances and letters of credit, these products may become less competitive, which may adversely affect advance and capital stock levels as well as letters of credit levels. For additional discussion of how our liquidity requirements may impact our earnings, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nIn addition, we fund certain overnight or shorter-term investments and advances with debt that has a maturity that extends beyond the maturities of the related investments or advances. The Liquidity AB provides guidance on maintaining appropriate funding gaps for three-month (-10% to -20%) and one-year (-25% to -35%) maturity horizons, which we were required to meet by December 31, 2018. Subject to market conditions, the Bank's cost of funding may increase if we are required to achieve the appropriate funding gap by using longer term funding, on which we generally pay higher interest than on our short-term funding.\nWe are sensitive to maintaining an appropriate liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and liabilities, and we measure and monitor the risk of refunding such assets as liabilities mature (refunding risk). In measuring the level of assets requiring refunding, we take into account their contractual maturities, as further described in the notes to the financial statements. In addition, we make certain assumptions about their expected cash flows. These assumptions include: calls for assets with such features, projected prepayments and scheduled amortizations for our MPF Loans held in portfolio, MBS and ABS investments.\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balances of (1) MPF Loans held in portfolio, (2) AFS securities, and (3) HTM securities (including ABS and MBS investments), by expected principal cash flows. The table is illustrative of our assumptions about the expected cash flow of our assets, including prepayments made in advance of maturity.\n\nWe consider our liabilities available to fund assets until their contractual maturity. For further discussion of the liquidity risks related to our access to funding, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nFHLB P&I Funding and Contingency Plan Agreement. We have entered into an agreement with the other FHLBs and the Office of Finance regarding the Federal Reserve's intraday funding process to provide a mechanism for the FHLBs to provide liquidity to avert a shortfall in the timely payment of principal and interest on any consolidated obligations by one or more FHLBs. We may increase our liquidity ratio for a designated month out of an 11 month rotation to mitigate the risk that we are required to fund under the FHLB P&I Funding and Contingency Plan Agreement. Through the date of this report, no FHLB has been required to fund under this contingency agreement.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nFunding\nConditions in Financial Markets\nIn October 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 1.50 to 1.75 percent and maintained that rate at the December 2019 meeting. October was the third time the FOMC reduced the benchmark interest rate in 2019, following similar rate cuts in July 2019 and September 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the markets predict approximately a 50 percent chance of an additional rate cut by the end of 2020. Throughout 2019, U.S. Treasury yields were lower across all maturities, although these yields were mixed during the fourth quarter of 2019 relative to the end of the third quarter, with lower rates in the front end of the curve and higher rates for maturities greater than two years.\nWe maintained ready access to funding throughout 2019.\nLIBOR Transition\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's (U.K.) Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the U.K., announced its intention to cease sustaining the LIBOR indices after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. The ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its recommended alternative rate. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasuries repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018 and the FHLB System issued its first SOFR-linked debt in the market on November 13, 2018. In January 2019, we participated in our first SOFR-indexed bond issuance and in February 2019, we began offering our first SOFR-linked advance. Many of our assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR, some with maturities or termination dates extending past December 31, 2021. In addition, on September 27, 2019, the FHFA issued a Supervisory Letter (the \"Supervisory Letter\") that the FHFA stated is designed to ensure the FHLBs will be able to identify and prudently manage the risks associated with the termination of LIBOR in a safe and sound manner. Among other things, the Supervisory Letter provides that the FHLBs should cease entering into certain transactions referencing LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. See Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13 for a discussion of the Supervisory Letter and its potential impact on the Bank. For further discussion of the risks related to the replacement of LIBOR, see page 24 of the Risk Factors section. We are currently evaluating and planning for the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the primary replacement rate for investments and advances.\nWe have developed an initial LIBOR transition action plan and convened a project team to implement the transition, which is led by a senior executive and comprised of representatives from various areas across the Bank. Our Asset-Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is the management committee responsible for overseeing the transition from LIBOR. In assessing our current exposure to LIBOR, we have begun to develop an inventory of financial instruments impacted and begun to identify contracts that may require adding or adjusting the \"fallback\" language which provides for contractual alternatives to the use of LIBOR when LIBOR cannot be determined based on the method provided in the agreement. We have amended the terms of certain advance products to include fallback language and the OF has added or adjusted fallback language applicable to FHLB consolidated obligations. We continue to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and investment securities as well as fallback language for new activities and issuances of financial instruments. We are in the process of assessing our operational readiness, including updating our processes and information technology systems to support the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nMarket activity in SOFR-indexed financial instruments continues to increase, including the emergence of a SOFR-based derivative market, and we continue to participate in the issuance of SOFR-indexed consolidated bonds. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we have participated in the issuance of $11.8 billion in SOFR-linked consolidated bonds. We continue to execute LIBOR-indexed derivatives to manage interest-rate risk. We have also begun to use Federal Funds Overnight Index Swap (Fed Funds OIS) swaps as an interest rate hedging strategy for financial instruments that do not have embedded options, as an alternative to using LIBOR when entering into new derivative transactions. We have begun to offer SOFR-linked advances to our members, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, have issued $18 million in SOFR-linked advances. We also offer Discount Note-index floater advances, which some members have used as alternatives to LIBOR-linked advance products.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nVariable-Rate Financial Instruments by Interest-Rate Index and LIBOR-Indexed Financial Instruments\nWe have advances, investment securities, consolidated bonds, and derivatives with interest rates indexed to LIBOR. The following tables presents our variable rate financial instruments by interest-rate index at December 31, 2019 and may not include instruments that indirectly incorporate LIBOR or another interest rate index. The tables also do not consider the impact of any fallback language contained in our financial products. ABS and MBS are presented by contractual maturity, however, their expected maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees.\n\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nLiquidity Analysis - Statement of Cash Flows\nOur assets and liabilities support our mission to provide our member shareholders competitively priced funding, a reasonable return on their investment in our capital stock, and support for their community investment activities. Our assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by member-driven activities and market conditions. We believe the cash flows from our operating and financing activities are sufficient to fund both our operating and investing liquidity needs. The following tables compare our significant cash flow activities in 2019 and 2018.\nFor comparisons to 2017 please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K starting on page 51.\nCash flows from operating activities with significant activity\n\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from the change in fair value of our derivatives and hedging activities. The Federal Reserve was gradually raising interest rates during 2018 but reversed course rapidly and significantly during 2019 resulting in a significant change in net fair value on derivatives.\nCash flows from investing activities with significant activity\n\nOur investing activities consist predominantly of liquid assets, investment debt securities, advances, and MPF Loans. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities changed for the following reasons:\n \u2022 We increased our liquid assets in 2019 to comply with regulatory guidance. \n \u2022 We continued to purchase investment debt securities in 2019 but at a lower rate than in 2018 due to the above noted increase in liquid assets. \n \u2022 Overall, members paid back more advances in 2019 compared to 2018, when more members took out new advances. \n \u2022 MPF Loan volume increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower interest rates which increased mortgage refinancings and loan origination. Increased utilization by PFIs and the addition of new PFIs from our Bank also contributed to higher volume. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nCash flows from financing activities with significant activity\n\nOur financing activities primarily reflect cash flows related to issuing and repaying consolidated obligations. The proceeds from our discount notes and bonds were primarily utilized to fund our investing activities as noted above. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities changed for the following reasons:\n \u2022 We had a net decrease in funds provided from discount notes as we took advantage of more favorable rates on longer termed bonds as noted below. \n \u2022 We increased the amount of our consolidated obligation bonds used to fund the growth in our balance sheet as we continued to take advantage of favorable variable interest rates on longer term bonds as compared to a higher reliance on discount notes. \nSources of Funding\nWe fund our assets principally with consolidated obligations (bonds and discount notes) issued through the Office of Finance, deposits, and capital stock. As of December 31, 2019, our consolidated obligations were rated AA+ (with outlook stable) by S&P and Aaa (with outlook stable) by Moody's. Consolidated obligations have GSE status although they are not obligations of the United States and the United States does not guarantee them.\nReliance on short-term debt offers us certain advantages which are weighed against the increased risk of using short-term debt. Traditionally we have benefited from interest rates below LIBOR rates for our short-term debt which has resulted in a positive impact on net interest income when used to fund LIBOR-indexed assets.\nThe following table summarizes our short-term discount notes and consolidated obligation bonds with original maturities of one year or less. Weighted average rates exclude hedging adjustments. For comparisons to 2017 please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K starting on page 53.\n\nWe comply with FHFA regulations that require we maintain the following types of assets free from any lien or pledge in an amount at least equal to the amount of our consolidated obligations outstanding:\n \u2022 cash; \n \u2022 obligations of, or fully guaranteed by, the United States; \n \u2022 secured advances; \n \u2022 mortgages, which have any guaranty, insurance, or commitment from the United States or any agency of the U.S. government; and \n \u2022 investments described in Section 16(a) of the FHLB Act, which, among other items, includes securities that a fiduciary or trust fund may purchase under the laws of the state in which the FHLB is located. \nAt December 31, 2019, we had eligible assets free from pledges of $99.3 billion, compared to our outstanding consolidated obligations of $92.1 billion.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Office of Finance has responsibility for the issuance of consolidated obligations. It also services all outstanding debt, provides us with information on capital market developments, manages our relationship with ratings agencies with respect to consolidated obligations, and prepares the FHLBs' combined quarterly and annual financial statements. The Office of Finance will allocate the proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations that cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLB demand for funding during periods of financial distress and when its existing allocation processes are deemed insufficient. In general, the proceeds in such circumstances will be allocated among the FHLBs based on regulatory capital unless the Office of Finance determines that there is an overwhelming reason to adopt a different allocation method. As is the case during any instance of disruption in our ability to access the capital market, market conditions or this allocation could adversely impact our ability to finance our operations, which could thereby adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidated Obligation Bonds\nConsolidated obligation bonds (bonds) satisfy term funding requirements and are issued under various programs. The maturities of these securities may range from less than one year to over 20 years, but they are not subject to any statutory or regulatory limits on maturity. The bonds can be fixed- or adjustable-rate, and callable or non-callable. We also offer fixed-rate, non-callable (bullet) bonds via the FHLBs' Tap issue program. This program uses specific maturities that may be reopened daily during a three month period through competitive auctions. The goal of the Tap program is to aggregate frequent smaller issues into a larger bond issue that may have greater market liquidity.\nAlthough we issue fixed-rate bullet and callable bonds, we may also issue bonds that have adjustable rates, step-up rates that step-up or increase at fixed amounts on predetermined dates, zero-coupons, and other types of rates. See Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations to the financial statements for details. Bonds are issued and distributed daily through negotiated or competitively bid transactions with approved underwriters or selling groups.\nWe receive 100% of the net proceeds of a bond issued via direct negotiation with underwriters of FHLB debt when we are the only FHLB involved in the negotiation; we are the sole FHLB that is primary obligor on the bond in those cases. When we and one or more other FHLBs jointly negotiate the issuance of a bond directly with underwriters, we receive the portion of the proceeds of the bond agreed upon with the other FHLBs; in those cases, we are primary obligor for the pro rata portion of the bond based on proceeds received. The majority of our bond issuance is conducted via direct negotiation with underwriters of the FHLB bonds, some with, and some without, participation by other FHLBs.\nWe may also request specific bonds to be offered by the Office of Finance for sale via competitive auction conducted with underwriters in a bond selling group. One or more other FHLBs may request amounts of the same bonds to be offered for sale for their benefit via the same auction. We may receive from 0% to 100% of the proceeds of the bonds issued via competitive auction depending on:\n \u2022 the amount and cost for the bonds bid by underwriters; \n \u2022 the maximum cost we or other FHLBs participating in the same issue, if any, are willing to pay for the bonds; and \n \u2022 guidelines for allocation of the bond proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance. \nWe also participate in the Global Issuances Program, under which the FHLB System, through the Office of Finance, maintains a process for scheduled issuance of global fixed-rate consolidated bonds. As part of this process, management from each FHLB determines and communicates a firm commitment to the Office of Finance for an amount of scheduled global debt to be issued on its behalf. If the FHLBs' orders do not meet the minimum debt issuance size, each FHLB receives an allocation of proceeds equal to the larger of the FHLB's commitment or the ratio of the individual FHLB's capital to total capital of all of the FHLBs. If the FHLBs' commitments exceed the minimum debt issuance size, then the proceeds are allocated based on actual commitment amount. The FHLBs can, however, pass on any scheduled calendar slot and decline to issue any global consolidated obligations under this program upon agreement of at least eight of the 11 FHLBs.\nConsolidated Obligation Discount Notes\nThe FHLBs sell consolidated obligation discount notes (discount notes) in the capital markets to provide short-term funds for advances to members, for seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in savings flows, and for mortgage financing and investments. Discount notes have maturities up to 365 days and are sold through a selling group and through other authorized securities dealers. Discount notes are sold at a discount and mature at par.\nOn a daily basis, we may request specific amounts of discount notes with specific maturity dates to be offered by the Office of Finance at a specific cost for sale to underwriters in the selling group. One or more other FHLBs may also request an amount of discount notes with the same maturity to be offered for sale for their benefit on the same day. The Office of Finance commits to issue discount notes on behalf of the participating FHLBs when underwriters in the selling group submit orders for the specific\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\ndiscount notes offered for sale. We may receive from zero to 100% of the requested proceeds depending on: the maximum costs we or other FHLBs participating in the same discount notes, if any, are willing to pay for the discount notes; the amount of orders for the discount notes submitted by underwriters; and guidelines for allocation of discount note proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance.\nTwice weekly, we may also request specific amounts of discount notes with fixed maturity dates ranging from four weeks to 26 weeks to be offered by the Office of Finance for sale via competitive auction conducted with underwriters in the selling group. The bi-weekly discount note auction uses a single-price (Dutch) award method to determine winning bids. One or more FHLBs may also request amounts of those same discount notes to be offered for sale for their benefit via the same auction. We may receive from zero to 100% of the requested proceeds depending on the amounts and costs for the discount notes bid by the underwriters and guidelines for allocation of discount note proceeds among multiple participating FHLBs administered by the Office of Finance. The majority of our issuances are conducted via the twice weekly auctions.\nDeposits\nWe accept deposits from our members, institutions eligible to become our members, institutions for which we are providing correspondent services, other FHLBs, and other government instrumentalities such as the FDIC. We offer several types of deposits to our deposit customers including demand, overnight, and term deposits. Deposits are not a significant source of funding for our operations and are primarily offered for the convenience of our members doing business with us.\nThe following table presents average deposit balances and the rate paid. For comparisons to 2017 please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K starting on page 55.\n\nCapital Resources\nCapital Rules\nUnder our Capital Plan our stock consists of two sub-classes of stock, Class B1 stock and Class B2 stock (together, Class B stock), both with a par value of $100 per share and redeemable on five years' written notice, subject to certain conditions. Under the Capital Plan, each member is required to own capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement or an activity stock requirement. Class B1 stock is available to support a member's activity stock requirement. Class B2 stock is available to support a member's membership stock requirement and any activity stock requirement.\nThe following table reflects the ranges of capital stock requirements permitted under our Capital Plan and requirements during 2019.\n\n a The amount of a member's Class B2 stock that exceeds this threshold\u201d and is necessary to support advance activity is automatically converted to Class B1 stock. \n b A member's investment in membership stock is subject to a cap. \n c The activity stock requirement applies to all outstanding and new advances other than those advances made through the Bank's RCAP. \n d Ranges reflected above are from our current Capital Plan, as last amended and restated effective October 1, 2015. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOur Capital Plan allows for an activity stock requirement for MPF Loans acquired for our portfolio within a range of 0% and 6%, which our Board has set at 0%. Currently, the Bank does not have a capital stock requirement for the issuance of standby letters of credit. However, we have received regulatory communication relating to the inclusion of an activity stock requirement for letters of credit, the specific terms of which have not yet been determined, and any such requirement will need to be included in an amended capital plan. At such time as the Board decides to introduce, or at such time as our regulator imposes, an activity stock requirement for MPF Loans or standby letters of credit, we intend to notify members sufficiently in advance of the change and apply that change only to future acquisitions or transactions.\nMembership stock requirements will continue to be recalculated annually, whereas the activity stock requirement and any automatic conversion of Class B2 stock to Class B1 stock related to the threshold will apply on a daily basis.\nWe may only redeem or repurchase capital stock from a member if, following the redemption or repurchase, the member continues to meet its minimum investment requirement and we remain in compliance with our regulatory capital requirements discussed below.\nMembers that withdraw from membership must wait at least five years after their membership was terminated and all of their capital stock was redeemed or repurchased before being readmitted to membership in any FHLB.\nUnder the terms of our Capital Plan, our Board of Directors is authorized to amend the Capital Plan, and the FHFA must approve all such amendments before they become effective.\nReduced Capitalization Advance Program\nDuring 2019, we continued to offer our Reduced Capitalization Advance Program (RCAP), which allows members to borrow both short-term and long-term advances with an activity stock requirement of only 2% for the life of the advance instead of the current 4.5% requirement under our Capital Plan's general provisions. As of December 31, 2019, RCAP advances outstanding total $24.2 billion to 142 members. We may implement future programs for advances with a reduced activity stock requirement that may or may not have the same characteristics as current RCAP offerings.\nMinimum Capital Requirements\nWe are subject by regulation to the following three capital requirements:\n \u2022 total regulatory capital ratio; \n \u2022 leverage capital ratio; and \n \u2022 risk-based capital. \nFor tables showing our compliance with the total capital ratio and leverage capital ratio as well as further details on all of our capital requirements, see Note 12 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements.\nUnder the risk-based capital requirement (which was amended effective January 1, 2020, as discussed below), we must maintain permanent capital equal to the sum of our (i) credit risk capital requirement, (ii) market risk capital requirement, and (iii) operations risk capital requirement, as outlined below:\n \u2022 Credit Risk Capital Requirement. The credit risk capital requirement is the sum of the capital charges for our assets, off balance sheet items, and derivatives contracts. These capital charges are calculated using the methodologies and percentages assigned by the FHFA regulations to each class of assets. \n \u2022 Market Risk Capital Requirement. The market risk capital requirement is the sum of (a) the market value of our portfolio at risk from movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices that could occur during periods of market stress; and (b) the amount, if any, by which the market value of total capital is less than 85% of the book value of total capital. \n \u2022 Operations Risk Capital Requirement. The operations risk capital requirement is 30% of the sum of our (a) credit risk capital requirement and (b) market risk capital requirement. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table summarizes our risk-based capital amounts. Under the FHFA regulation on capital classifications and critical capital levels for the FHLBs, we were adequately capitalized.\n\nAs discussed in Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13, effective January 1, 2020 amended FHFA regulations revised: (1) the credit risk component of the risk-based capital requirements through certain changes to the capital charges assigned to advances, non-mortgage assets, off-balance sheet assets and derivatives, and (2) the market risk component of the requirements by repealing the 85% requirement (i.e., that market risk capital include an amount equal to the market value of the Bank's total capital that is less than 85% of the book value of the Bank's total capital). The Bank does not expect that the revisions to the credit risk and market risk component of the risk-based capital requirements will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations in the future.\nStatutory and Regulatory Restrictions on Capital Stock Repurchase and Redemption\nIn accordance with the FHLB Act, our capital stock is considered putable with restrictions given the significant restrictions on the obligation/right to redeem.\nWe cannot redeem shares of stock from any member if:\n \u2022 the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation is not paid in full when due; \n \u2022 we fail to certify in writing to the FHFA that we will remain in compliance with our liquidity requirements and will remain capable of making full and timely payment of all of our current obligations; \n \u2022 we notify the FHFA that we cannot provide the required quarterly certification, or project that we will fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements, or will be unable to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations; or \n \u2022 we actually fail to comply with statutory or regulatory liquidity requirements or to timely and fully meet all of our current obligations, or enter or negotiate to enter into an agreement with one or more other FHLBs to obtain financial assistance to meet our current obligations. \nAdditional statutory and regulatory restrictions on the redemption and repurchase of our capital stock include the following:\n \u2022 In no case may we redeem or repurchase capital stock if, following such redemption, we would fail to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the GLB Act or the FHFA. \n \u2022 In no case may we redeem or repurchase capital stock if either our Board of Directors or the FHFA determines that we have incurred, or are likely to incur, losses resulting or expected to result in a charge against capital stock. In addition to being able to prohibit capital stock redemptions and repurchases, our Board has a right to call for additional capital stock purchases by members, as a condition of continuing membership, as needed for us to satisfy our statutory and regulatory capital requirements. \nThe FHLB Act provides that, in accordance with rules, regulations, and orders that may be prescribed by the FHFA, we may be liquidated or reorganized and our capital stock paid off and retired, in whole or in part, after paying or making a provision for payment of our liabilities. The FHLB Act further provides that, in connection with any such liquidation or reorganization, any other FHLB may, with the approval of the FHFA, acquire our assets and assume our liabilities, in whole or in part.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nCapital Amounts\nThe following tables, respectively, presents our five largest holders of regulatory capital stock and reconciles our capital reported in our statements of condition to the amount of capital stock reported for regulatory purposes. MRCS is included in the calculation of the regulatory capital and leverage ratios but is recorded as a liability in the statements of condition.\n\n a One Mortgage Partners Corp. is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank NA. \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the above table consists of changes in market value of various balance sheet accounts where the change is not recorded in earnings but are instead recorded in equity capital as the income (loss) is not yet realized. For details on these changes please see Note 13 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the financial statements.\nAlthough we had no OTTI year to date in 2019, credit deterioration may negatively impact our remaining private label MBS portfolio. We cannot predict if or when impairments will occur, or the impact these impairments may have on our retained earnings and capital position.\nComponents of total GAAP capital changed for the following reasons:\n \u2022 The increase in capital stock corresponds to our members' increased use of our advances to support their borrowings. \n \u2022 Total retained earnings increased due to our net income less dividends paid; see Statements of Capital on page for details. \nBeginning in February 2020, the FHFA will consider the proportion of capital stock to assets, measured on a daily average basis at month end, when assessing each FHLB's capital management practices. See Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments on page 13.\nRepurchase of Excess Capital Stock\nBeginning on October 31, 2019, we stopped repurchasing all excess Class B2 membership stock on a weekly basis .However, members may continue to request repurchase of excess stock on any business day. All repurchases of excess capital stock requested by members will continue until otherwise announced, but remain subject to our regulatory requirements, certain financial and capital thresholds, and prudent business practices.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nRepurchase of excess capital stock held by members is subject to compliance with the following financial and capital thresholds both before and after repurchase:\n \u2022 The ratio of our total capital to total assets is greater than or equal to 4.25%; \n \u2022 Our ratio of the Bank's market value of equity to book value of equity is at least 85% on a U.S. GAAP basis; \n \u2022 Our risk-based capital is greater than or equal to 125% of the minimum amount required, as discussed in Capital Resources on page 54; \n \u2022 Compliance with all of our minimum regulatory capital requirements; \n \u2022 Projected compliance with each of our minimum regulatory capital requirements for the next four quarters using the most recent expected case income projections; and \n \u2022 Compliance with our contractual obligations under the Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement, as discussed in Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement with other FHLBs on the next page. \nFor further information on amounts of excess stock repurchased, see Statements of Capital to the financial statements.\nRetained Earnings & Dividends\nDividend Payments\nFHFA rules state that FHLBs may declare and pay dividends only from previously retained earnings or current net earnings, and may not declare or pay dividends based on projected or anticipated earnings. Under our Capital Plan, any dividend declared on Class B1 shares must be greater than or equal to the dividend declared on Class B2 shares for the same period, and dividends may be paid in the form of cash or stock, or a combination of both. All dividends we have paid since 2011 have been in cash rather than stock. We have paid an enhanced dividend on Class B1 activity stock since the fourth quarter of 2013.\nAlthough we continue to work to maintain our financial strength to support a reasonable dividend, any future dividend payment remains subject to declaration by our Board and will depend on future operating results, our Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy, and any other factors the Board determines to be relevant.\nWe may not pay dividends if we fail to satisfy our minimum capital and liquidity requirements under the FHLB Act and FHFA regulations. Further, under FHFA regulations, we may not pay any dividends in the form of capital stock if excess stock held by our shareholders is greater than 1% of our total assets or if, after the issuance of such shares, excess stock held by our shareholders would be greater than 1% of our total assets.\nRetained Earnings and Dividend Policy\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy (Policy) which, as last updated in December 2019, establishes a target for retained earnings to provide a cushion against the potential for loss that could impact shareholder value. Specifically, the Policy requires us to establish an overall target for retained earnings incorporating the following components:\n \u2022 Risk-based targets based on estimates using the greater of (1) modified regulatory-based estimates with components for credit risk and market risk, (2) results of our annual stress test, and (3) parametric value-at-risk estimates for credit and market risk. Each of these risk-based alternatives incorporates additional estimates for exposures related to (a) operational risk, (b) repurchase risk arising from obligations to third party investors from loans originated under the MPF Program, (c) settlement risk relating to unsettled consolidated obligations and investment debt securities, (d) accounting risk related to hedge accounting and OTTI accounting ; (e) counterparty risks relating to risk of loss due to failure of a counterparty in an unsecured transaction; and (f) the amount of loans outstanding under the Bank's Community First Fund; \n \u2022 Earnings-based targets that would allow the Bank to pay a reasonable return on member capital in low-rate and low-member utilization environments; and \n \u2022 Risk-adjusted capital target that would allow the Bank to meet regulatory capital requirements without reliance on risk-based retained earnings under stressful conditions. \nUnder the Policy, we may, but are not required, to pay a dividend out of our net income (with certain adjustments as described below) or retained earnings, after consideration of the retained earnings target on a quarterly basis and management's assessment of the current adequacy of retained earnings. The maximum dividend allowed would align with requirements set forth in the Policy regarding target levels of retained earnings and risk-adjusted capital, and achievement of risk-based targets.The Board may declare a dividend less than the maximum dividend permitted under the Policy. For these purposes, adjusted net income is net income resulting directly from certain business activities, excluding income from such activities as advance prepayments, transfers of debt to other FHLBs and gains or losses resulting from certain hedge practices.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends at annualized percentage rates per $100 of par value as presented in the below table (based on the previous quarter's earnings).\n\nOn January 23, 2020, our Board of Directors maintained the dividend declared per share on both sub-classes of capital stock. Based on our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019, the Board declared a cash dividend of 5.00% (annualized) for Class B1 activity stock and a cash dividend of 2.25% (annualized) for Class B2 membership stock. This dividend, including dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock (recorded as interest expense), totaled $25 million and was paid on February 13, 2020. As further discussed in Executive Summary on page 35, on January 23, 2020, the Bank also provided dividend guidance for the next two quarters.\nJoint Capital Enhancement Agreement with other FHLBs\nThe FHLBs, including us, entered into a Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement (JCE Agreement) intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLB. The intent of the JCE Agreement is to allocate that portion of each FHLB's earnings to a separate retained earnings account at that FHLB. For more information on the JCE Agreement, see Note 12 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) to the financial statements.\nAlthough restricted retained earnings under the JCE Agreement are included in determining whether we have attained the retained earnings target under the Bank's Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy discussed above, these restricted retained earnings will not be available to pay dividends. We do not believe that the requirement to contribute 20% of our future net income to a restricted retained earnings account under the JCE Agreement will have an impact on our ability to pay dividends except in the most extreme circumstances. There is a provision in the JCE Agreement that if, at any time, our restricted retained earnings were to fall below the required level, we would only be permitted to pay dividends out of (1) current net income not required to be added to our restricted retained earnings and (2) retained earnings that are not restricted.\nFICO Dissolution\nOn October 2019, the Financing Corporation (FICO), formed pursuant to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Recapitalization Act of 1987 to provide financing for the resolution of failed savings and loan associations, commenced the process of dissolution in accordance with relevant statutory requirements and the terms of a plan of dissolution approved by the Director of the FHFA. Subject to the satisfaction of any claims and the payment of other administrative expenses upon FICO's dissolution, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2020, any surplus and remaining cash on hand of FICO is expected to be distributed to the FHLBs, as FICO's sole stockholders, in proportion to their ownership in FICO's nonvoting capital stock. The Bank's ownership in FICO's nonvoting capital stock is 9.69%. The receipt by the Bank of any such distribution from FICO will be treated as a partial return of its prior capital contributions to FICO and credited to its unrestricted retained earnings. The Bank does not expect any distribution from FICO to materially affect the Bank's financial condition or combined results of operations.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe provide members with letters of credit for a fee. If a beneficiary draws under a letter of credit, our member either reimburses us for the amount drawn or the drawn amount is converted into a collateralized advance to the member. If any advances were to be issued under these letters of credit, they would be made under the same standards and terms of collateral as any other advance issued to that member at that point of time.\nWe have entered into standby bond purchase agreements with the Illinois and Wisconsin state housing authorities. Upon request of the applicable authority, we enter into an agreement with them to purchase and hold the authority's bonds for a fee until the designated remarketing agent can find a suitable investor.\nRefer to Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements for further disclosures related to our commercial commitments, such as letters of credit and standby bond purchase agreements.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nWe enter into various contractual obligations that require us to make future cash payments. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations due by period:\n\n a Total excludes projected contractual interest payments for consolidated obligation bonds of $3.6 billion. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nRisk Management\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Fraud, legal, compliance, financial reporting, model and technology risks are components within the definition of operational risk. We have established programs to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report operational risks such as comprehensive risk assessments, establishing policies and procedures, loss incident reporting and obtaining appropriate insurance coverage to mitigate the likelihood of, and potential losses from, such occurrences.\nGovernance and Control Activities\nThe Board of Directors has established Bank-wide policies governing operational risk, which include an Enterprise Risk Management Policy and an Enterprise Operational Risk Management Policy. Primary oversight responsibility for operational risk is vested with our management level Operational Risk Oversight Committee. Responsibilities of this committee include, but are not limited to, oversight and review of Bank-wide operational risks such as the management of business continuity, technology (including information security) risks, issues or updates, operational aspects of new business activities, analysis and mitigation of any operational loss, vendor management, oversight and direction to our compliance activities, and oversight to internal controls and procedures in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Committee monitors the performance of these operational activities by reviewing management reports prepared by the responsible business manager on a periodic basis. Also, the Committee monitors the effectiveness of operational controls through the reporting of critical operational losses, events, risk assessments, operational risk metrics, and a quarterly certification of operational and internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur executive officers or their delegates provide periodic reports, as appropriate, to the following Board committees: Risk Management Committee, Operations and Technology Committee, and the Audit Committee.\nBusiness Resiliency\nIn order to ensure our ability to provide liquidity and service to our members and PFIs, we have business resumption plans designed to restore critical business processes and systems in the event of a variety of business interruptions. We maintain key information systems infrastructure with vendors that have reliable and consistent data recovery capabilities as well as more optimal geographic diversity to provide a more resilient technology infrastructure. We are party to a reciprocal arrangement with the FHLB Dallas to allow members to access their deposits as well as have access to overnight advances to the extent they have collateral already in place. Both the FHLB Dallas and our off-site recovery plans are subject to periodic testing.\nCredit Risk\nWe define credit risk as the risk to our earnings or capital due to an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with us, or to otherwise perform as agreed. We are exposed to credit risk principally through:\n \u2022 Member credit products, such as advances, letters of credit, and other extensions of credit to borrowers; \n \u2022 MPF Loans and related exposures; \n \u2022 investment debt securities; \n \u2022 securities purchased under agreements to resell; \n \u2022 unsecured short-term investments; \n \u2022 Community First Fund loans; and \n \u2022 derivatives. \nManaging Our Credit Risk Exposure Related to Member Credit Products\nOur member credit products credit risk exposure includes our secured credit extensions, such as advances, letters of credit, and related extensions of credit to members. See Note 6 - Advances and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements for further details on member credit products. We lend to our members in accordance with federal statutes and FHFA regulations. We manage our credit exposure to our member credit products using a risk-based integrated approach as discussed below. We utilize conservative collateral/lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing members' needs for a reliable source of funding.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nEstablishing Credit Limits - Under our credit policy, a member's initial credit limit is set at 35% of their total assets, subject to modifications up or down based primarily on the following factors:\n \u2022 The collateral value of eligible collateral a member has pledged. Collateral value represents the borrowing capacity assigned to the types of collateral we accept for member credit products. Collateral value does not imply fair value. \n \u2022 A member's risk rating, which is determined by assessing their creditworthiness and financial condition utilizing financial information available to us, including the quarterly financial statement reports members file with their regulators. Additionally, we conduct an ongoing review of each borrower's financial condition. \n \u2022 For increases to the initial credit limit, approval by the Credit and Collateral Committee, our CRO, or our CEO is required. \nMember Credit Outstanding - We track total credit risk with our members. The total credit risk concentrated with members with 10% or more of our total member credit outstanding is as follows:\n\n a One Mortgage Partners Corp. is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank NA. \nMember Credit Risk Ratings - Our credit risk rating system focuses primarily on our member's overall financial health and takes into account the member's asset quality, earnings, and capital position. We utilize our credit risk rating system to assign each member a credit risk rating from one (lowest credit risk) to five (highest credit risk). Our credit risk rating represents our assessment of the risk of member insolvency rather than the risk of credit loss on the member's credit outstanding with us. We utilize the credit risk rating of a member to manage our credit risk through collateral controls, and as a result, we have never suffered a credit loss on a member credit product. Credit risk mitigation actions may be applied to members perceived to pose increased risk, and are commonly applied to members with credit risk ratings of four and five. Specifically, these members may be:\n \u2022 required to maintain higher amounts of collateral; \n \u2022 required to deliver loan collateral to us or a third party custodian on our behalf; \n \u2022 restricted from obtaining certain member credit products; and \n \u2022 faced with more stringent collateral reporting requirements. \nThe following table presents the number of members and related credit outstanding to them by credit risk rating. Credit outstanding consists primarily of outstanding advances and letters of credit. MPF credit enhancement obligations, member derivative exposures, and other obligations make up the rest. Of the total credit outstanding, $50.1 billion were advances (par value) and $23.9 billion were letters of credit at December 31, 2019, compared to $52.6 billion and $24.3 billion at December 31, 2018.\n\nThe majority of members assigned a 4 rating in the above table were required to submit specific collateral listings and the majority of members assigned a 5 rating were required to deliver collateral to us or to a third party custodian on our behalf.\nNature and Amount of Collateral Pledged - Collateral arrangements may vary by type of member (e.g., depository versus non-depository institutions), lien structure, member credit quality, collateral availability, collateral type, results of periodic on-site reviews of collateral, and overall member credit exposure. The FHLB Act requires us to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure member credit products. Eligible collateral includes whole first mortgages on improved residential property, or non-agency securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages; securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its agencies (includes MBS issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and FHLB consolidated\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nobligations); cash or deposits; and other real estate related collateral (includes home equity loans and lines of credit, farmland, and commercial real estate) that has a readily ascertainable value, can be reliably discounted to account for liquidation risk and can be liquidated in due course and that we can perfect a security interest in such collateral. We also accept pledges of secured business or agri-business loans from community financial institutions (CFIs), which are permitted under the FHLB Act.\nIn certain circumstances, such as when a member's membership is terminated due to a merger and the acquiring entity is a member of another FHLB; the other FHLB may agree to manage the former member's collateral covering advances and any other amounts still outstanding to us and will subordinate to us either certain collateral it receives from the member or certain categories of collateral. Likewise, if one of our members were to acquire the member of another FHLB, we may agree to manage the collateral for the other FHLB and subordinate our security interest in a certain category of collateral.\nOur Advances, Collateral Pledge and Security Agreement requires that a member provide collateral value equal to its credit outstanding (unless we specifically require more for a particular member). The value assigned to securities and loan collateral is calculated as shown below. It should be noted that the applicable percentage margin utilized in the calculation for securities or loans vary based on the type of collateral being pledged, as well as factors (that vary whether the collateral is a security or loan) including model risk, broker fees, market volatility and liquidity, the type of collateral reporting, the member's risk rating, and whether the member is a depository or non-depository.\n \u2022 For securities, we multiply the applicable margin by the market value of each security; and \n \u2022 For loans, we multiply the applicable margin by the unpaid principal balance of pledged loans, along with any applicable percentage applied to adjust for exceptions found during a member's collateral review. \n \u25aa In general members pledging loan collateral via blanket reporting will receive the margins published, as a percent of unpaid principal balance. \n \u25aa Members with listed and/or delivered loan collateral will generally receive the margins published, which will be applied as a percent to the lower of par or market value of the unpaid principal balance of the reported loan collateral. \nControls over Pledged Collateral - We require delivery of all securities collateral and may also require delivery of loan collateral under certain conditions (for example, when a member's credit condition deteriorates).\nThe FHLB Act requires that each advance to a member be fully secured. We are required to obtain and maintain a security interest in collateral securing advances. The FHLB Act provides that any security interest granted to us by our members, or an affiliate of such member, is entitled to priority over the claims and rights of any party, including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor other than claims and rights that would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual bona fide purchasers for value or by actual secured parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests. We perfect the security interests granted to us by members and affiliates by taking possession of securities collateral and by filing UCC-1 financing statements on all other collateral.\nFor depository institutions, we generally require members to pledge collateral under a blanket lien under which our security interest in collateral is automatically released when the member has sold or otherwise transferred its ownership interest in the collateral (unless otherwise notified by us) and such collateral is not required to secure a member's outstanding credit obligations and we have not required the member to list or deliver such collateral. Under the Advances, Collateral Pledge and Security Agreement with our members, a member must maintain collateral with a collateral value to fully cover its credit outstanding. If the collateral does not have collateral value sufficient to cover the credit outstanding, we require a member to pledge other assets as collateral to cover the shortage, this includes the pledging of types of collateral that are outside of our eligibility criteria. As a result, we may require listing or delivery of the additional collateral from the member at any time while there is credit outstanding. Additionally, we have a lien on their capital stock in us.\nThe method by which a member reports collateral is dependent upon the collateral status to which it is assigned, as well as the type of collateral being pledged. In order for a member to have borrowing capacity with us, the member must report its eligible collateral using one of the following methods. Under blanket reporting, a member that has granted us a blanket lien on certain categories of collateral may report the collateral types on a qualified collateral report. For members that list collateral, either by choice or as directed by us, the member must submit a listing of its collateral which includes loan-level detail of the collateral. Securities pledged to us must be delivered to us or an approved third party custodian pursuant to a collateral control agreement. Loan collateral pledged to us may be required to be delivered to an approved third party custodian pursuant to a collateral control agreement. Regardless of the manner in which the collateral is pledged, all members must report their collateral to us at least quarterly.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nWe also conduct periodic on-site loan collateral reviews to confirm the collateral meets our eligibility requirements. On-site collateral verifications are performed on a schedule that varies based upon, including, but not limited to, our assessment of the credit risk of the member, the size of the member's credit exposure, the types of collateral pledged, and the amount of collateral coverage.\nWe have not recorded any allowance for credit losses for our on balance sheet member credit products nor any liabilities for our off balance sheet member credit products in the periods presented based on the following factors:\n \u2022 Our credit outstanding is sufficiently well collateralized as a result of the collateral and credit risk mitigation efforts described above; \n \u2022 Our credit analyses of our members; \n \u2022 The repayment history on member credit products; and \n \u2022 No member credit products that were past due, on nonaccrual status, involved in a troubled debt restructuring, or otherwise considered impaired. \nMPF Loans and Related Exposures\nFor a description of the MPF Program see Mortgage Partnership Finance Program on page 8.\nCredit Risk Exposure - Our credit risk exposure on conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio is the potential for financial loss due to borrower default and depreciation in the value of the real estate collateral securing the MPF Loan, offset by our ability to recover losses from PMI, Recoverable CE Fees, and the CE Amount which may include SMI. The PFI is required to pledge collateral to secure any portion of its CE Amount that is a direct obligation of the PFI. The unpaid principal balances of our conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio exposed to credit losses was $8.9 billion at December 31, 2019, and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Our actual credit exposure is less than these amounts because the borrower's equity, which represents the fair value of underlying property in excess of the outstanding MPF Loan held in portfolio balance, has not been considered.\nOur MPF Loans held in portfolio includes conventional mortgage loans that may be viewed as having greater credit risk because the borrowers have weaker credit histories. The current MPF Program eligibility criteria for conforming conventional MPF Loans excludes loans to borrowers with a FICO score less than 620. Historically, we accepted MPF Loans from borrowers with FICO scores below 620 provided they met the underwriting standards set forth in the MPF Guides, which require compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks (issued October 4, 2006) and the Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending (issued on July 10, 2007) issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of the Thrift Supervision, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration. MPF Loans to borrowers with no FICO scores are also eligible for delivery under the MPF Program provided that acceptable alternate documentation of credit history is provided. We do not classify these MPF Loans internally as subprime\u201d because they are not higher-priced mortgage loans. Mortgages that meet the MPF Program's definition of higher-priced mortgage loans are not eligible for delivery under the MPF Program. MPF Loans with borrowers having no FICO scores or with FICO scores less than 660 represent a relatively small portion of our total conventional MPF Loan portfolio.\nFor MPF Loans, the MPF Program allows for varying levels of documentation with respect to borrower income, and the level of documentation is considered when determining the amount of credit enhancement required for each Master Commitment under the credit model we utilize to set the CE Amount. To date, we have not experienced material differences in loss or delinquency rates based on documentation levels of our conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio.\nUnder the MPF Government MBS product, we must advance the scheduled principal and interest payments to the securities holders of Ginnie Mae MBS that we issued if the servicing PFI defaults on its payment obligations to advance the scheduled remittances. Once MPF Government MBS loans are ninety days delinquent, we have the option to repurchase the mortgage loan out of the security and work with a servicer to mitigate the credit loss.\nSetting Credit Enhancement Levels - For conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio, credit losses in a Master Commitment are first absorbed by the Bank's FLA but, if applicable to the MPF product, we will withhold a PFI's scheduled performance credit enhancement fee in order to reimburse ourselves for any losses allocated to the FLA. If the FLA is exhausted, the credit losses are then absorbed by the PFI's CE Amount that is calculated by utilizing third party credit models. For further details on the FLA and PFI's CE Amount, refer to Loss Structure for Credit Risk Sharing Products on page 9 and Conventional MPF Loans Held in Portfolio on page.\nThe PFI's CE Amount is determined by the Bank, based on documented analysis, that the Bank has a high degree of confidence that it will not bear material losses beyond the losses absorbed by the Bank's FLA, even under reasonably likely adverse changes to expected economic conditions. Loans are assessed by third party credit models at acquisition and a credit\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nenhancement is calculated based on credit attributes of the loans in each Master Commitment. Credit losses on a loan may only be absorbed by the CE Amount in the Master Commitment related to the loan.\nThe CE Amounts and the FLA for certain conventional MPF Products held in our portfolio may be periodically reset lower for each Master Commitment after a required period of seasoning because the amount of credit enhancement necessary to maintain our risk of credit losses within our risk tolerance is usually reduced over time.\nFor the MPF Plus product, the PFI is required to provide an SMI policy covering the MPF Loans in the Master Commitment and having a deductible initially equal to the FLA. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the outstanding balances of MPF Loans under the MPF Plus product with SMI coverage were $148 million and $265 million and the amounts of SMI coverage provided against losses were $9 million and $12 million. The reduction in coverage was due to the resetting of SMI policies as provided in the MPF Plus product structure. Credit losses associated with Master Commitments where the SMI coverage has been discontinued are incorporated into the allowance for credit losses calculation. Such credit losses were immaterial.\nThe following table shows the status of our credit enhancement structure on conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio. Unpaid principal balances in this table include REO, as losses in REO impact, and are impacted by, the credit enhancement structure of a Master Commitment. As defined, the CE Amount includes SMI on the MPF Plus product. Government Loans are excluded from the table as they are not directly credit enhanced by the PFI.\n\n a For each product above, except MPF Original, a portion of losses experienced at the FLA level may be recovered through the withholding of performance-based CE Fees from PFIs. \n b Credit losses on a loan may only be absorbed by the CE Amount in the Master Commitment related to the loan. For further detail refer to Conventional MPF Loans Held in Portfolio on page. \nConcentration Risks - In conjunction with assessing credit risks on the MPF Loan portfolio, we also assess concentration risks that could negatively impact this portfolio.\nGeographic Concentration - While we have MPF Loans throughout the United States, our largest concentrations of 10% or more of conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio were secured by properties located in the states shown in the following table. Amounts shown are based on outstanding par value. An overall decline in the economy, residential real estate market, or the occurrence of a natural disaster could adversely affect the value of the mortgaged properties in these states and increase the risk of delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy or loss on MPF Loans, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nSeller Concentration - During 2019, the top five PFIs, in the aggregate, accounted for 44% of our MPF Loans purchased and held in portfolio on our balance sheet. To the extent we lose our business with these PFIs and cannot attract comparable replacements, our business may be adversely affected.\nFor further discussion of how concentration risks may affect us, see Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nMortgage Repurchase Risk - We are exposed to mortgage repurchase risk in connection with our sale of MPF Loans to Fannie Mae under the MPF Xtra product, to third party investors under the MPF Direct Product, and to Ginnie Mae for MPF Loans securitized in Ginnie Mae MBS if a loan eligibility requirement or other warranty is breached. We may require the PFI from which\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nwe purchased the ineligible MPF Loan to repurchase that loan from us or indemnify us for related losses or request indemnification from the PFI's MPF Bank as further discussed in the Risk Factors starting on page 18.\nOur mortgage repurchase liability is an estimate of our losses associated with all mortgage loans previously sold in connection with the MPF Xtra, MPF Direct, and MPF Government MBS products for which a breach of representation or warranty has occurred. We consider factors based predominantly on our historical repurchase experience and only include mortgage loans for which we deem it probable that we will be required to either repurchase the mortgage loan or indemnify the applicable third party for losses. This assessment is primarily made during our quality assurance review process. Our estimate incorporates our experiences with third party repurchase demands, PFIs' historical ability to cure repurchase demands, and an assumed loss severity given default.\nThe methodology to estimate the associated mortgage repurchase liability for MPF Government MBS loans also considers potential repurchases based on delinquency activity or lack of final loan certifications within issued pools. We are expected to maintain delinquency rates on outstanding issuances below key thresholds and fulfill operational requirements published by Ginnie Mae.\nWe accrue a mortgage repurchase liability with an offsetting charge to noninterest expense when it is probable and reasonably estimable that we will be obligated to repurchase a loan or indemnify an investor.\nBased on the above factors:\nWe recognized a mortgage repurchase liability of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2019, and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2018, on the MPF Xtra loans. We also recognized an offsetting receivable due from our PFIs, since we deem it probable that we will recover any losses from third parties (e.g., PFIs and other MPF Banks). We believe the estimate of reasonably possible losses is zero as of the end of this reporting period.\nWe have repurchased $8 million of unpaid principal balances related to mortgage loans sold as part of our off balance sheet MPF Loan products for the year ending December 31, 2019, compared to $9 million for 2018, and $4 million for 2017. These repurchases represent repurchase requests that have been resolved during the reporting period. Due to recoveries from PFIs, we incurred no material losses on these loans.\nWe have $18 million as of December 31, 2019, of unpaid principal with respect to MPF Xtra loans that represent unresolved claims with Fannie Mae, in which a repurchase demand may occur compared to $24 million at December 31, 2018; see Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements.\nAdditionally, PFIs are required to repurchase ineligible MPF Loans held in our portfolio unless we either require the PFI to indemnify us or decide to continue to hold such loans in our portfolio. The PFI repurchase requirement is a factor in determining our allowance for credit losses. If a PFI is unable to repurchase ineligible MPF Loans or indemnify us, we would incur a loss to the extent a credit loss is not recovered from collateral provided by the PFI or, alternatively, from the FDIC. In this regard, we have not recorded an allowance for credit losses related to MPF Loans held in our portfolio, as we do not expect to incur any losses after factoring in our recovery claims from PFIs.\nWe record allowances for credit losses for MPF Loans held in portfolio based on available information of past events and the current economic conditions existing as of the date of our statements of condition. Such information includes, but is not limited to, delinquency rates, loss severities, and prepayment speeds consistent with the percentages of delinquent, nonaccrual, and impaired MPF Loans to total conventional MPF Loans. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the financial statements for details on our charge-off policy. Additionally, refer to Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses to the financial statements for further details on our allowance for credit losses.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nFive year trend in our MPF Loans held in portfolio\nThe following table shows the five year trend in our MPF Loans held in portfolio.\n\n a Includes loans which are well-secured and in the process of collection. MPF Loans that are on nonperforming status, and are collateral-dependent, are excluded. Collateral-dependent is when repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying property. Government Loans are included because repayment is insured or guaranteed by the government. \n b We do not recognize interest on nonaccrual loans. \n c The net (charge-off)/recovery rate was less than one basis point for all periods presented. \nInvestment Debt Securities\nOn October 15, 2010, we instituted litigation relating to 64 private label MBS bonds purchased by us in an aggregate original principal amount of $4.29 billion. Our complaints assert claims for untrue or misleading statements in the sale of securities, and it is possible that the classifications of private label MBS, as well as other statements made about the securities by the issuer, are inaccurate. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings on page 30 for details on this litigation.\nIn the following tables, we classify our private label MBS as prime, subprime, or Alt-A based upon the nature of the majority of underlying mortgages collateralizing each security based on the issuer's classification, or as published by an NRSRO, at the time of issuance of the MBS.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nIn addition to private label MBS, we also hold a variety of other investment debt securities we believe are low risk and mostly government backed or insured such as GSE debt and FFELP ABS.\nInvestment Debt Securities by Rating\nThe carrying amounts of our investments are presented in the following table by the long term NRSRO credit rating of the counterparty.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nInvestment Debt Securities Issuer Concentration\nThe following table summarizes our investment debt securities by issuer with a carrying amount exceeding 10% of our stockholders' equity:\n\nAging and Carrying Amount\nA table presenting the aging of our investments for the current year, as well as the carrying amounts for the previous two years can be found in Note 5 - Investment Debt Securities to the financial statements. It also discloses the yields by aging categories for the current year.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis - Mortgage Backed Securities\nSignificant Inputs Used to Determine OTTI\nWe assess an HTM or AFS private label MBS security for OTTI whenever its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis as of the reporting date. Specifically, we generate cash flow projections utilizing key modeling assumptions, significant inputs, and methodologies provided by an FHLB System OTTI Committee, which was formed by the FHLBs to achieve consistency among the FHLBs in their OTTI analyses for private label MBS. We then utilize these cash flow projections to determine OTTI on our private label MBS; however, we are still responsible for making our own OTTI determination, which includes determining the reasonableness of assumptions, significant inputs, and methodologies used, and performing the required present value calculations using appropriate historical cost bases and yields.\nCash Flow Analysis\nWe perform a cash flow analysis for substantially all of these private label securities utilizing two models provided by independent third parties as described below,\n \u2022 First model. This model considers borrower characteristics and the particular attributes of the loans underlying the securities, in conjunction with assumptions about future changes in home prices and interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, and loss severities. A significant input to the first model is the forecast of future housing price changes for the relevant states and core based statistical areas (CBSAs), which are based upon an assessment of the individual housing markets. \n \u2022 Second model. This model uses the month-by-month projections of future loan performance derived from the first model and allocates the projected loan level cash flows and losses to the various security classes in the securitization structure in accordance with its prescribed cash flow and loss allocation rules. \nWe had no OTTI charge for the year ended December 31, 2019, under a base case (best estimate) scenario. We also performed a cash flow analysis for each of these securities under a more stressful scenario, or adverse case scenario. This adverse case scenario was primarily based on a short-term housing price forecast that was five percentage points lower than the base case, followed by a path with annual rates of housing price growth that included rates which were 33.0% lower than the base case. Based on the adverse scenario, we would not have had a material OTTI charge.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nOther Credit Indicators:\nThe following table presents the outstanding unpaid principal balance and credit ratings on our private label residential MBS by Prime, Alt-A, and Subprime as designated at time of issuance. For securities on which an OTTI charge has been taken, see Note 5 - Investment Debt Securities to the financial statements. Except for an immaterial amount of fixed rate, these MBS are all variable rate securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, 36% of the total mortgage properties collateralizing our private label MBS were located in California, which was the only state with a concentration exceeding 10% of this portfolio.\nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\nWe invest in securities purchased under agreements to resell in order to ensure the availability of funds to meet members' liquidity and credit needs. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are secured by collateral of marketable securities held by a third party custodian. If the fair value of the accepted collateral decreases below the fair value amount required as collateral, our counterparty is required to provide an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral to make up the shortfall. If the credit markets experience disruptions, it may increase the likelihood that one of our counterparties could experience liquidity or financial constraints that may cause them to become insolvent or otherwise default on their obligations to us. If the collateral's fair value amount has decreased below the resale agreement's carrying amount, we may suffer a credit loss.\nThe credit ratings of securities purchased under agreement to resell are disclosed along with investment debt securities and unsecured short-term investments, in the Investment Debt Securities by Rating table on page 68.\nUnsecured Short Term Investments\nWe invest in unsecured short-term investments in order to ensure the availability of funds to meet members' credit and liquidity needs. We have credit risk exposure from our unsecured short-term investment portfolio, which may consist of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and Federal Funds sold. We have established the following policies and procedures to limit and monitor our unsecured credit risk exposure.\n \u2022 Eligible counterparties for short-term investments are: \n \u25aa other FHLBs; \n \u25aa other U.S. GSEs; and \n \u25aa FDIC-insured financial institutions, including U.S. subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks, or U.S. branches of foreign commercial banks whose most recently published financial statements exhibit at least $250 million of Tier 1 (or total) \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\ncapital. Foreign banks shall be domiciled in a country whose sovereign rating is at least \"Aa3\" from Moody's or AA- from Standard & Poor's unless otherwise approved by the Bank's Credit and Collateral Committee, Chief Risk Officer or President.\n \u2022 Our unsecured credit exposures to U.S. branches or agency offices of foreign commercial banks include the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, the counterparty may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Our unsecured credit exposures to domestic counterparties and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks include the risk that these counterparties have extended credit to foreign counterparties. \n \u2022 Unsecured credit investment maturities are subject to maximum amounts and tenors as established by the Bank. \n \u2022 We actively monitor our credit risk exposure and the credit quality of each counterparty, including an assessment of each counterparty's financial performance, capital adequacy, sovereign support (if applicable) and the current market perceptions of the counterparty. General macro-economic, political and market conditions may also be considered when deciding on unsecured exposure. As a result of this monitoring activity, we may limit or terminate existing unsecured credit exposure limits. \nThe following table presents the credit ratings of our unsecured investment counterparties, organized by the domicile of the counterparty or, where the counterparty is a U.S. branch or agency office of a foreign commercial bank, by the domicile of the counterparty's parent. This table does not reflect the foreign sovereign government's credit rating. The unsecured investment credit exposure presented in the table may not reflect the average or maximum exposure during the period as the table reflects only the balances at period end.\n\nAll $9.036 billion of the unsecured credit exposure in the above table represent overnight investments and $425 million in the above table were with members and their affiliates. Any amounts related to members over a 10% concentration are included in the amounts in the Member Credit Outstanding table on page 62.\nManaging Our Credit Risk Exposure Related to Derivative Agreements\nSee Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities to the financial statements for a discussion of how we manage our credit risk exposure related to derivative agreements. We have credit exposure on net asset positions where we have not received adequate collateral from our counterparties. We also have credit exposure on net liability positions where we have pledged collateral in excess of our liability to a counterparty.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table presents our derivative positions where we have such credit exposures. The rating used was the lowest rating among the three largest NRSROs. Non-cash collateral pledged consists of initial margin we posted through our FCMs, on behalf of the DCOs for cleared derivatives and is included in our derivative positions with credit exposure.\n\n a Less than $1 million is shown as zero. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Chicago\n(Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated)", "item_7_tables": "Table 130:

million in 2018. Net interest income decreased due to lower prepayment fees on investment securities, while noninterest income increased primarily from gains on instruments held at fair value.\n\n- Total assets were $99.8 billion at year-end 2019, up from $92.9 billion at year-end 2018, mainly due to growth in liquidity assets and MPF loans to meet member demand.\n\n- Advances outstanding declined slightly to $50.5 billion due to changes in member funding needs. The largest borrowing member accounted for 21.9% of total advances.\n\n- The Bank continued offering the Reduced Capitalization Advance Program (RCAP) which allows lower activity stock requirements on advances. \n\n- The Bank is preparing for the transition away from LIBOR by 2021, including developing a transition plan, evaluating the impact, and starting to offer SOFR-linked products.\n\n- The Bank has increased efforts around diversity and inclusion, including signing the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge.\n\n- Credit risk exposure remains low on member products due to collateral requirements. No allowance for losses has been recorded.\n\n- The Bank has some concentration risk from geographic location of mortgages and largest borrowing members. Steps are taken to mitigate these risks.\n\nIn summary, the Bank continued solid financial performance in 2019 while preparing for upcoming regulatory and market changes. There is some concentration risk but credit exposures appear well collateralized."}
