MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nWe are an energy services holding company whose principal business is the safe, reliable and cost-effective distribution of natural gas in seven states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida, Tennessee and Maryland - through our seven natural gas distribution utilities. We are also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to our primary business. We have four reportable segments - distribution operations, retail operations, wholesale services and midstream operations - and one non-reportable segment - other. These segments are consistent with how management views and operates our business. Amounts shown in this Item 7, unless otherwise indicated, exclude discontinued operations. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information regarding discontinued operations. The following table shows the proportion of certain financial metrics attributable to our segments.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Capital expenditures\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midstream operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other/intercompany eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Objectives Our priorities for 2016 are consistent with the direction we have taken the company over the last several years. We will remain focused on safe and efficient operations across all of our businesses, improving customer satisfaction and awareness of the benefits of our product and investment in infrastructure for the future. Several of our specific business objectives are detailed as follows:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distribution Operations: Invest necessary capital to enhance and maintain safety and reliability in delivering natural gas; remain an efficiency leader within the industry while maintaining a focus on customer satisfaction; expand the natural gas distribution system and educate energy consumers on the benefits of converting to natural gas. We intend to continue investing in our regulatory infrastructure programs to minimize the lag in recovery of our capital. We continue to effectively manage costs and leverage our shared services model across our businesses to combat inflationary effects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retail Operations: Maintain our current customer base in Georgia and Illinois while continuing to expand into other profitable retail markets and expand our warranty businesses through partnership opportunities with affiliates and third parties. We will focus on products that are responsive to our customers' needs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Wholesale Services: We continue to position our business to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility and third-party customers and to hedge natural gas prices to manage costs effectively, reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage relative to other marketers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Midstream Operations: Invest in natural gas based projects, some of which remain subject to regulatory approvals, along with our existing pipelines and storage to support our efforts to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to our customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability and generate economic development in the areas served. For additional information on our pipeline projects, see Note 3 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein and Item 1, Business\u201d under the caption Midstream Operations.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Additionally, we intend to maintain our strong balance sheet and liquidity profile, solid investment grade ratings and our commitment to sustainable annual dividend growth. For additional information on our reportable segments, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein and Item 1, Business.\u201d\nPerformance and Non-GAAP Measures We evaluate segment performance using the measures of EBIT and operating margin. EBIT includes operating income and other income and expenses and excludes interest expense and income taxes, which we evaluate on a consolidated basis. Operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues minus cost of goods sold and revenue tax expense in distribution operations. Operating margin excludes operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, merger-related expenses, goodwill impairment charges and the gain or loss on the sale of our assets, which are included in our calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe believe that the presentation of operating margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of goods sold and revenue tax expenses can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to our customers. We further believe that operating margin at our retail operations, wholesale services and midstream operations segments allows us to focus on a direct measure of operating margin before overhead costs.\nGlossary\nWe present the non-GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share - as adjusted, which exclude merger-related expenses and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge at midstream operations. As we do not regularly engage in transactions of the magnitude of the proposed merger with Southern Company, and consequently do not regularly incur merger expenses of correlative size, we believe presenting diluted earnings per share excluding merger expenses provides investors with an additional measure of our core operating performance. We also have chosen to exclude a non-cash goodwill impairment related to our midstream operations segment because management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our core operating performance without this non-cash item.\nOperating margin and diluted earnings per share - as adjusted should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful indicators of, our operating performance than net income attributable to AGL Resources, operating income or diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our operating margin and diluted earnings per share - as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSummary of Results:\nThe table below reconciles (i) operating revenues and operating margin to operating income, (ii) EBIT to income before income taxes and net income and (iii) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share - as adjusted to GAAP diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations, together with other consolidated financial information for the last three years.

This decrease was due primarily to lower consolidated EBIT of $350 million, largely driven by wholesale services, and was partially offset by lower income tax expense of $137 million due to lower earnings in 2015.\nIncluded in the 2015 EBIT were $44 million of merger-related expenses and a $14 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge at our midstream operations segment. Excluding these items and the $314 million year-over-year change in results of wholesale services, EBIT increased by $22 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the following:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$34 million in additional operating margin at distribution operations from regulatory infrastructure programs, partially offset by $19 million in higher depreciation expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$19 million in additional operating margin at retail operations due to the recovery of prior year hedge losses and lower current year derivative losses resulting from changes in natural gas prices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlossary\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>These increases were partially offset by weather at distribution operations and retail operations due to significantly warmer temperatures in 2015, compared to 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Wholesale services reported $108 million of EBIT in 2015, compared to $422 million in 2014, a decrease of $314 million. In 2014, wholesale services benefited from increased natural gas volatility that was generated by significantly colder-than-normal weather through higher commercial activity and net hedge gains. Wholesale services continued to benefit from market volatility in 2015 and generated EBIT that was significantly higher than its average economic earnings expectation of $50 million.\n2014 Results In 2014, our income from continuing operations attributable to AGL Resources increased by $272 million, or 94%, compared to 2013. This increase was primarily the result of the following:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significantly higher commercial activity primarily in the first quarter of 2014, and mark-to-market hedge gains, net of LOCOM adjustments at wholesale services in 2014 from price volatility generated by colder-than-normal weather, which increased operating margin by $462 million compared to 2013.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased operating margin at distribution operations and retail operations of $50 million mainly due to significantly colder-than-normal weather in 2014 as well as customer usage and customer growth.

When the merger becomes effective, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2016, each share of our common stock, other than certain excluded shares, will convert into the right to receive $66 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the approval of certain state utility and other regulatory agencies. On November 19, 2015, the proposed merger was approved by our shareholders at a special meeting. At closing, the transaction is expected to create the second largest utility in the U.S. by customer base and we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company and continue to maintain our own management team. For additional information relating to this transaction, see Note 2 and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" herein for information on the merger-related risks.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues We generate the majority of our operating revenues through the sale, distribution and storage of natural gas. Our consolidated revenues include an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed, but not yet billed to our customers from the date of the last bill to the end of the reporting period.

Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for gas on our distribution systems. With the exception of Nicor Gas and Florida City Gas, we have regulatory mechanisms, such as weather normalization, which limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of our utilities' respective service areas. However, our utility customers in Illinois and our retail operations customers in Georgia can be impacted by warmer- or colder-than-normal weather. Additionally, we utilize weather hedges at distribution operations and retail operations to reduce negative earnings impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather, while retaining all of the earnings upside in the event of colder-than-normal weather for distribution operations in Illinois and most of the earnings upside for our retail operations.

In the first quarter of 2015 weather in Illinois was 10% colder-than-normal, while weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 28% warmer-than-normal in Illinois. Since we hedged our Illinois weather risk for these quarterly periods separately and hedged only exposure for warmer-than-normal weather, the EBIT impact of weather for the year was favorable by $2 million, net of the impact of our weather hedging for distribution operations. The colder-than-normal weather in Illinois in 2014 primarily drove an EBIT increase of $22 million, for distribution operations, based on 10-year normal weather. For our retail operations in Georgia, weather in 2015 was 16% warmer-than-normal and 24% warmer than the same period last year. Similar to our strategy for distribution operations, because we hedged weather risk for our retail operations for the first and fourth quarters separately and hedged exposure for warmer-than-normal weather, the EBIT impact of weather for the year was slightly unfavorable by $1 million in 2015. The colder-than-normal weather increased EBIT by $8 million in 2014 compared to expected levels based on 10-year normal weather for our retail operations.\nCustomers The number of customers at distribution operations and energy customers at retail operations can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions and competition from alternative fuels. Our energy customers at retail operations are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.

We use a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. These efforts include adding residential customers, multifamily complexes and commercial and industrial customers who use natural gas for purposes other than heating, as well as evaluating and launching new natural gas related programs, products and services to enhance customer growth, mitigate customer attrition and increase operating revenues. These programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. We also target customer conversions to natural gas from other energy sources, emphasizing the pricing advantage of natural gas. These programs focus on premises that could be connected to our distribution system at little or no cost to the customer. In cases where conversion cost can be a disincentive, we may employ rebate programs and other assistance to address customer cost issues.\nIn 2016, we intend to continue efforts in our retail operations segment to enter into targeted markets and expand energy customers and service contracts. We anticipate this expansion will provide growth opportunities in future years.\nGlossary\nVolume Our natural gas volume metrics for distribution operations and retail operations, as shown in the following table, illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas compared to the prior year.

This allows our natural gas storage business to generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, but retain some consistency with its earnings and maximize the value of its investments.\nOur midstream operations storage business is cyclical, and the abundant supply of natural gas in recent years and resulting lack of market and price volatility have negatively impacted the profitability of our storage facilities. The rates at which we may re-contract expiring capacity may not be as high as expected and may also remain below historical averages in 2016. The prices for natural gas storage capacity are expected to increase as supply and demand quantities reach equilibrium with continued economic improvement, expected exports of LNG, and projected demand increases in response to low prices and expanded uses for natural gas. The following table contains the overall monthly average firm subscription rates per facility and amount of firm capacity subscription for all periods presented. These amounts exclude 5 Bcf contracted by Sequent as of December 31, 2015, at an average monthly rate of $0.080 and 7 Bcf as of December 31, 2014, at an average monthly rate of $0.050.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average rates\n(per dekatherm)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Firm capacity under subscription (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average rates\n(per dekatherm)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Firm capacity under subscription (Bcf)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jefferson Island\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golden Triangle\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Valley\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeasonality of our Results During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to our distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain Consolidated Balance Sheets items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenue, inventories and short-term debt. However, these items are comparable when reviewing our annual results. Our base operating expenses, excluding cost of goods sold, interest expense, bad debt expense and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, our operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.

These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs, such as depreciation, interest, maintenance and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders.\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, our second largest utility, the earnings of our regulated utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas and general economic conditions that may impact our customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. We have various weather mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in their respective service areas.

Retail operations is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts. In 2015, we recovered $15 million of prior period hedge losses and LOCOM adjustments as the underlying transactions were recognized at higher margins. The net effect is that the transactions ultimately resulted in the expected economic outcome at the time the derivatives were executed to manage the associated price risk.\nGlossary\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT - prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recovery of hedge losses (gains)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in value of unrealized derivatives as a result of NYMEX natural gas prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LOCOM adjustments, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Improved warranty margins\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in 2015 due to customer mix.

We have positioned the business to generate positive economic earnings even under low volatility market conditions that can result from a number of factors, including weather fluctuations and changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the country. However, when market price volatility increases as we experienced in both 2015 and 2014, we are well positioned to capture significant value and generate stronger results. We principally use physical and financial arrangements to reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in market conditions and changing commodity prices. These economic hedges may not qualify, or are not designated for, hedge accounting treatment. As a result, our reported earnings for wholesale services reflect changes in the fair values of certain derivatives. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as gains or losses within our operating revenues.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT - prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in commercial activity largely driven by the transportation and storage portfolios in the Northeast and Midwest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(304\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in value of storage derivatives as a result of fluctuations in NYMEX natural gas prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in value of transportation and forward commodity derivatives from price movements related to natural gas transportation positions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LOCOM adjustments, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease due to sale of Compass Energy in May 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase related to incentive compensation expenses driven by higher earnings and other costs in 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease due to sale of Compass Energy in May 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in other income, primarily related to the gain on sale of Compass Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT - current year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table illustrates the components of wholesale services' operating margin for the periods presented.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial activity recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on storage derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory LOCOM adjustment, net of estimated current period recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on transportation and forward commodity derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlossary\nChange in commercial activity The commercial activity at wholesale services includes recognized storage and transportation values that were generated in prior periods, which reflect the impact of prior period hedge gains and losses as associated physical transactions occur in the period. Additionally, the commercial activity includes operating margin generated and recognized in the current period. The significant variances in commercial activity between 2015 and 2014 and between 2014 and 2013 are due largely to the recognition of significantly higher operating margin in 2014 associated with our transportation and storage portfolios, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions, from price volatility generated by the extreme and prolonged cold weather in that year. Additionally, 2015 operating margin was lower resulting from the withdrawal of storage inventory hedged at the end of 2014 relating to 2015 withdrawals that was included in the storage withdrawal schedule with a value of $(5) million as of December 31, 2014 compared to the comparable measure in 2014 of $28 million related to inventory hedged at the end of 2013. Operating margin in 2014 was also higher resulting from mark-to-market accounting derivative losses at the end of 2013. These mark-to-market losses were recovered in 2014 when the underlying related transactions were recognized at their higher values.\nChange in storage and transportation derivatives Continued price volatility in 2015 benefited wholesale services' portfolio of pipeline transportation and storage capacity assets throughout the U.S., primarily in the Northeast market. Although we do not expect this high level of price volatility to continue, we see the potential for market fundamentals indicating some level of increased volatility that would continue to benefit wholesale services should this occur. Storage derivative gains in 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to declines in natural gas prices applicable to the locations of our specific storage assets. These derivative gains were partially offset by LOCOM adjustments to natural gas inventories, net of estimated hedging recoveries.\nGains in our transportation and forward commodity derivative positions in 2015 are primarily due to the narrowing of transportation basis spreads associated with warmer-than-normal weather, which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points, primarily in the Northeast region. Gains in our transportation and forward commodity derivative positions in 2014 are primarily the result of narrowing transportation basis spreads. Transportation and forward commodity hedge losses in 2013 were the result of widening transportation basis spreads, and were largely recovered in 2014 with the physical flow of natural gas and utilization of the contracted transportation capacity.\nWe account for natural gas stored in inventory differently than the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio. The natural gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas daily or spot prices at the end of the year. The derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period using forward natural gas prices. This difference in accounting treatment can result in volatility in wholesale services' reported results, even though the expected net operating revenue and expected economic value are substantially unchanged since the date the transactions were initiated. These accounting timing differences also affect the comparability of wholesale services' period-over-period results, since changes in forward NYMEX prices do not increase and decrease on a consistent basis from year to year. Largely as a result of moderate weather in the fourth quarters of both 2015 and 2014 leading to significant decreases in natural gas prices, wholesale services recorded LOCOM adjustments of $19 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFor our natural gas transportation portfolio, we enter into transportation capacity contracts with interstate and intrastate pipelines for the delivery of natural gas between receipt and delivery points in future periods. We purchase natural gas for transportation when the market price we pay for gas at a receipt point plus the cost of transportation capacity required to deliver the gas to the delivery point is less than the sales price at the delivery point. The difference between the prices at the receipt and delivery points is the transportation basis or location spread. Similar to our storage transactions, we attempt to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our transportation portfolio by using derivative instruments to reduce the risk associated with future changes in the price of natural gas at the receipt and delivery points. We utilize futures contracts or OTC derivatives to hedge both the commodity price risk relative to the market price at the receipt point and the market price at the delivery point to substantially protect the operating revenue that we will ultimately realize once the natural gas is received, delivered and sold.\nVolatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on our customer rates, our long-term competitive position against other energy sources and the ability of our wholesale services segment to capture value from location and seasonal spreads. During both the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, we experienced increased price volatility brought on largely by colder weather and supply constraints in the Northeast and Midwest regions, which enabled us to capture value under these market conditions. Commercial activity in 2014 was particularly favorable due to significant natural gas price volatility, largely the result of significantly colder-than-normal weather primarily in the first quarter.\nWhile market conditions in 2014 and early 2015 experienced more natural gas price volatility, in the near term, we anticipate low volatility in certain areas of our portfolio, but expect a continuation of some volatility in the supply-constrained Northeast corridor. Over the longer term, we expect volatility to be low to moderate and locational or transportation spreads to decrease over time as new pipelines are built to reduce the bottleneck in the currently constrained shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these pipelines are delayed or not built, volatility could increase. While natural gas supply increased during the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 Heating Seasons in the U.S., it was not enough to meet the increased demand, resulting in storage levels that were lower than historical periods. The warm 2015 winter weather experienced in the U.S. resulted in record natural gas inventories that contributed to reduced natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment,\nGlossary\nincluding the significant drop in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers and reduced levels of natural gas production. Further, if economic conditions continue to improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.\nThe expected natural gas withdrawals from storage, including the expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with our transportation portfolio at December 31, 2015 are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal from storage and the physical flow of natural gas between contracted transportation receipt and delivery points. Our expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, and other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt and delivery charges, but are net of the estimated impact of profit sharing under our asset management agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2015. A portion of wholesale services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues, timing notwithstanding. The timing of future withdrawals may change in response to changes in future economic value or other factors.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Storage withdrawal schedule\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total storage\n(in Bcf) (WACOG $2.27)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected net\noperating gains (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Physical transportation transactions -\nexpected net operating gains (losses) (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents expected operating gains from planned storage withdrawals associated with existing inventory positions and could change as wholesale services adjusts its daily injection and withdrawal plans in response to changes in future market conditions and forward NYMEX price fluctuations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents the periods associated with the transportation derivative (gains) losses during which the derivatives will be settled and the physical transportation transactions will occur that offset the derivative (gains) losses recognized in 2014 and 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The unrealized storage and transportation derivative gains do not change the underlying economic value of our storage and transportation positions and, based on current expectations, will primarily be reversed in 2016 when the related transactions occur and are recognized.

The liquidity required to fund these short-term needs is generally provided by our operating activities, and any needs not met are primarily satisfied with short-term borrowings under our commercial paper programs, which are supported by the AGL Credit Facility and the Nicor Gas Credit Facility. For more information on the seasonality of our short-term borrowings, see Short-term Debt\u201d later in this section. The need for long-term capital is driven primarily by capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt. Periodically, we raise funds supporting our long-term cash needs from the issuance of long-term debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs in a cost-effective manner.\nOur financing activities, including long-term and short-term debt and equity, are subject to customary approval or review by the state agencies in which we conduct business as well as the FERC. A substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flows is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us may be subject to regulation. By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. Additionally, Elizabethtown Gas is restricted by their dividend policy as established by the New Jersey BPU in the amount it can dividend to AGL Resources to the extent of 70% of its quarterly net income.\nWe believe the amounts available to us under our long-term debt and credit facilities as well as through the issuance of additional debt, combined with cash provided by operating activities will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, anticipated debt redemptions, interest payments on debt obligations, dividend payments and other cash needs through the next several years.\nThe ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and our debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, substantially depends upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which we are unable to control. These factors include, among others, regulatory changes, the price of and demand for natural gas, and operational risks.\nOur capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of debt and equity securities. This strategy includes active management of the percentage of total debt relative to total capitalization, as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities and maintenance of an appropriate mix of debt with fixed and floating interest rates. Our variable debt target is 20% to 45% of total debt. As of December 31, 2015, our variable-rate debt was $1.3 billion, or 28%, of our total debt, compared to $1.5 billion, or 31%, as of December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to reduced commercial paper borrowings resulting from warmer weather that resulted in lower natural gas sales as well as the lower cost of gas in 2015. For more information on our debt, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nOn November 18, 2015, AGL Capital issued $250 million in 10-year senior notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. The net proceeds from the senior notes of $248 million, which are guaranteed by AGL Capital, were used to repay a portion of AGL Capital's commercial paper, including $200 million we borrowed to repay senior notes that matured on January 15, 2015.\nIn January 2015, we executed $800 million in notional value of 10 year and 30 year fixed-rate forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge potential interest rate volatility prior to the anticipated issuances of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in 2016. We designated the forward-starting interest rate swaps, which mature on the respective debt issuance dates, as cash flow hedges. We settled $200 million of these interest rate swaps on November 18, 2015, in conjunction with the aforementioned senior note issuance. The remaining $600 million of interest rate swaps, which had a fair value of $9 million as of December 31, 2015, are expected to be settled in 2016. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption Interest Rate Risk\u201d for additional information.\nOur objective remains to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile, solid investment grade ratings and annual dividend growth. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate our need to increase available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements, including the impact of changes in natural gas prices, liquidity requirements established by rating agencies, acquisitions and other factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for additional information on items that could impact our liquidity and capital resource requirements.\nShort-term Debt The following table provides additional information on our short-term debt throughout the year.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-end balance outstanding (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Daily average balance outstanding (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minimum balance outstanding (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Largest balance outstanding (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper - AGL Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>787\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper - Nicor Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlossary\nThe largest, minimum and daily average balances borrowed under our commercial paper programs are important when assessing the intra-period fluctuations of our short-term borrowings and potential liquidity risk. The fluctuations are due to our seasonal cash requirements to fund working capital needs, in particular the purchase of natural gas inventory, margin calls and collateral posting requirements. The largest and minimum balances outstanding for each debt instrument occurred at different times during the period. Consequently, the total balances are not indicative of actual borrowings on any one day during the period. Cash requirements generally increase between June and December as we purchase natural gas in advance of the Heating Season. The timing differences between payment to our suppliers for natural gas purchases and recovery of costs from our customers through their monthly bills can significantly affect our cash requirements. Our short-term debt balances are typically reduced during the Heating Season, as a significant portion of our current assets, primarily natural gas inventories, are converted into cash.\nOur commercial paper borrowings are supported by the $1.3 billion AGL Credit Facility and $700 million Nicor Gas Credit Facility, which can be drawn upon to meet working capital and other general corporate needs. However, the Nicor Gas Credit Facility can only be used for the working capital needs of Nicor Gas. The interest rates payable on borrowings under these facilities are calculated at either the alternative base rate plus an applicable interest margin or LIBOR plus an applicable interest margin. The applicable interest margin used in both interest rate calculations will vary according to AGL Capital's and Nicor Gas' current credit ratings. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under either credit facility.\nThe timing of natural gas withdrawals is dependent on the weather and natural gas market conditions, both of which impact the price of natural gas. Increasing natural gas commodity prices can significantly impact our commercial paper borrowings. Based on our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015, and our maximum 70% debt to total capitalization allowed under our financial covenants, we could borrow an additional $798 million of commercial paper under the AGL Credit Facility and an additional $162 million of commercial paper under the Nicor Gas Credit Facility. As a result, based on current natural gas prices and our expected injection plan, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover our working capital needs.\nIn October 2015, we entered into agreements to amend and extend our credit facilities. Under the terms of these agreements, we extended the maturity dates of the AGL Credit Facility and Nicor Gas Credit Facility to November 9, 2018 and December 14, 2018, respectively. One of the banks elected not to participate in this extension and its total commitment of $75 million will continue through the fourth quarter of 2017. We also modified the credit facilities to provide for the limited consent by the lenders to the proposed merger with Southern Company. Additionally, we made similar changes to our Bank Rate Mode Covenants Agreement.\nThe lenders under our credit facilities and lines of credit are major financial institutions with $2.2 billion of committed balances and all had investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2015. It is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if a lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency. However, based on our current assessment of our lenders' creditworthiness, we believe the risk of lender default is minimal. Commercial paper borrowings reduce availability of these credit facilities.\nLong-term Debt Our long-term debt matures more than one year from December 31, 2015 and consists of medium-term notes; Series A, Series B, and Series C, which we issued under an indenture dated December 1989; senior notes; first mortgage bonds and gas facility revenue bonds. Our long-term cash requirements primarily depend upon our level of capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities and decisions to refinance long-term debt. The following table summarizes our long-term debt issuances and refinancings over the last three years.

Credit ratings are important to our counterparties when we engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. It is our long-term objective to maintain or improve our credit ratings in order to manage our existing financing costs and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and may periodically change. The rating agencies regularly review our performance and financial condition and reevaluate their ratings of our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, our corporate ratings and our ratings outlook. There is no guarantee that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of other ratings.\nGlossary\nFactors we consider important to assessing our credit ratings include our Consolidated Balance Sheets, leverage, capital spending, earnings, cash flow generation, available liquidity and overall business risks. We do not have any triggering events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any agreements that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. A downgrade in our current ratings, particularly below investment grade, would increase our borrowing costs and could limit our access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. As of December 31, 2015, if our credit rating had fallen below investment grade, we would have been required to provide collateral of $19 million to continue conducting business with certain customers.\nThe table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AGL Resources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nicor Gas\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fitch (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> P-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> P-1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> A2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratings outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>During the third quarter of 2015, S&P revised both AGL Resources' and Nicor Gas' ratings outlooks to positive from stable and Fitch revised AGL Resources' outlook to positive.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Credit ratings are for AGL Capital, whose obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by AGL Resources.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Moody's downgraded AGL Capital's senior unsecured rating to Baa1 from A3 during the third quarter of 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Default Provisions As indicated below, our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment or similar actions.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our credit facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to the failure to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness and a change of control;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our credit facilities contain certain non-financial covenants that, among other things, restrict liens and encumbrances, loans and investments, acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, asset dispositions, mergers and consolidations, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our credit facilities each include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 70% at the end of any fiscal month.

For additional information on our default provisions, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nCash Flows\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows using the indirect method, under which we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, changes in derivative instrument assets and liabilities, deferred income taxes, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses on the sale of assets and changes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for working capital during the period.

The increase was primarily related to (i) higher working capital needs during the prior year that was driven by higher natural gas prices and volumes delivered as well as the timing of recoveries of related gas costs from customers, (ii) cash provided by derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities primarily as a result of the decrease in forward NYMEX prices year-over-year and (iii) a 2014 tax refund of $150 million received in January 2015 related to the prior year extension of bonus depreciation late in 2014 (the 2015 tax refund related to the extension of bonus depreciation in late 2015 is expected in early 2016). These increases were partially offset by (i) lower earnings year-over-year largely attributable to warmer weather than experienced in 2014, and (ii) energy marketing receivables and payables, due to less cash received in 2015 from the prior year.\n2014 compared to 2013 Our net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2014 was $655 million, a decrease of $316 million or 33% from 2013. The decrease was primarily related to (i) income taxes, largely driven by the utilization of a prior period net operating loss that reduced the 2013 tax obligation combined with taxes paid in 2014 due to increased earnings and the repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings of Tropical Shipping, (ii) increased cash for inventory and (iii) trade payables, other than energy marketing, due to higher accrued volumes in December 2013 compared to December 2012. These decreases were partially offset by increases primarily related to (i) higher earnings year over year largely attributed to significantly colder-than-normal weather in 2014 and increased price volatility that enabled us to capture value in wholesale services and (ii) net energy marketing receivables and payables, due to higher cash received in 2014 from the prior year.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities Our net cash flow used in investing activities in 2015 increased $522 million, or 103%, from 2014, primarily as a result of increased infrastructure investment, primarily relating to Nicor Gas' Investing in Illinois program, combined with increased spending for other rate-based investments at distribution operations. Additionally, the variance was driven by the $225 million proceeds from the sale of Tropical Shipping during the third quarter of 2014. Our estimated PP&E expenditures for 2016 and our actual PP&E expenditures incurred in 2015, 2014 and 2013 are presented in the following table.\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New construction and infrastructure improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory infrastructure programs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Programs that update or expand our distribution systems to improve system reliability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage, pipelines and LNG facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Underground natural gas storage facilities, pipeline infrastructure and LNG production and transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primarily includes information technology and building and leasehold improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes Investing in Illinois at Nicor Gas, STRIDE at Atlanta Gas Light, SAVE at Virginia Natural Gas, AIR at Elizabethtown Gas and SAFE at Florida City Gas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The 2015 increase in PP&E expenditures of $258 million, or 34%, was due to increased spending of $281 million related to infrastructure improvements on our Investing in Illinois program. This was partially offset by decreased spending related to our new construction projects.\nOur PP&E expenditures were $769 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $731 million for the same period in 2013. The increase of $38 million or 5% was due to increased spending of $84 million primarily related to new construction and infrastructure improvements at our utilities. This was partially offset by a $46 million net decrease in expenditures for our regulatory infrastructure programs largely due to PRP at Atlanta Gas Light, which ended in 2013, offset by increased spending on our other regulatory infrastructure programs that primarily included $57 million at Atlanta Gas Light for i-VPR, $24 million at Elizabethtown Gas for AIR and $22 million at Nicor Gas for Investing in Illinois.\nOur estimated expenditures for 2016 include discretionary spending for capital projects principally within the distribution business, regulatory infrastructure programs, natural gas storage and other categories. We continuously evaluate whether or not to proceed with these projects, reviewing them in relation to various factors, including our authorized returns on rate base, other returns on invested capital for projects of a similar nature, capital structure and credit ratings, among others. We make adjustments to our discretionary expenditures as necessary based upon these factors.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities Our net cash flow used in financing activities in 2015 increased $142 million, or 63%, from 2014 primarily as a result of the net repayments of our commercial paper during 2015, partially offset by the excess of proceeds from our issuance of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 over the senior notes that matured in the first quarter of 2015. For more information on our financing activities, see \"Short-term Debt\" and \"Long-term Debt\" within Item 7 under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nNoncontrolling Interest We recorded cash distributions for SouthStar's dividends to Piedmont of $18 million in 2015, $17 million in 2014 and $17 million in 2013 as financing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nDividends on Common Stock Our common stock dividend payments were $244 million in 2015, $233 million in 2014 and $222 million in 2013. The increases were primarily due to the annual dividend increase of $0.08 per share in each of 2015 and 2014.\nGlossary\nOff-balance sheet arrangements We have certain guarantees, as further described in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. We believe the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. We also have authorized unrecognized ratemaking amounts, primarily composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain of our regulatory infrastructure programs, which are not reflected within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of business that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue-producing activities. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor.

We also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. We would expect to fund these contingent financial commitments with operating and financing cash flows.\nPension and welfare obligations. Generally, our pension plan funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Pension Protection Act. We calculate any required pension contributions using the traditional unit credit cost method; however, additional voluntary contributions are periodically made. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. The contributions represent the portion of the welfare costs for which we are responsible under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory agencies.\nThe state regulatory agencies in all of our jurisdictions, except Illinois, have phase-ins that defer a portion of the retirement benefit expenses for retirement plans other than pensions for future recovery. We recorded a regulatory asset for these future recoveries of $125 million as of December 31, 2015 and $122 million as of December 31, 2014. In Illinois, all accrued retirement plan expenses are recovered through base rates. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information about our pension and welfare plans.\nGlossary\nIn both 2015 and 2014, no contributions were required to our qualified pension plan. Based on the estimated funded status of the AGL Plan, we do not expect any required contribution to the plan in 2016. We may, at times, elect to contribute additional amounts to the AGL Plan in accordance with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Those judgments and estimates have a significant effect on our financial statements, primarily due to the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We frequently reevaluate our judgments and estimates that are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which represent those that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty, judgment and complexity. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nAccounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries\nAt December 31, 2015, our regulatory assets were $738 million and regulatory liabilities were $1.7 billion. At December 31, 2014, our regulatory assets were $714 million and regulatory liabilities were $1.7 billion. Our natural gas distribution operations and certain regulated transmission and storage operations meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity under GAAP. Accordingly, the financial results of these operations reflect the effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject.\nAs a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under GAAP are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable that they can be recovered through rates. The periods in which revenues or expenses are recognized are impacted by regulation. In instances where other GAAP accounting treatment supersedes Accounting Standards Codification 980 - Regulated Operations, we apply the other GAAP accounting treatment. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations.\nDiscontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses, as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Assets and liabilities recognized as a result of rate regulation would be written off in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred. A write-off of all our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2015 would result in 5% and 16% decreases in total assets and total liabilities, respectively. For more information on our regulated assets and liabilities, see Note 3 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets\nGoodwill We do not amortize our goodwill, but test it annually for impairment at the reporting unit level during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.\nAs part of our impairment test, an initial qualitative step 0 assessment is made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events and events specific to each reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nStep 1 of the two-step goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the result of our step 1 test reveals that the estimated fair value is below its carrying value we proceed with step 2.\nStep 2 of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill, which is calculated as the residual amount from the reporting unit's overall fair value after assigning fair values to its assets and liabilities under a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination, to its carrying value. Based on the result of the step 2 test, we record a goodwill impairment charge for any excess of carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill.\nWhile preparing our third quarter 2015 financial statements, and in connection with our 2016 annual budget process, we assessed various market factors and projections prepared by both internal and external sources related to subscription rates for contracting capacity at our storage facilities as well as the profitability of our storage and fuels reporting unit. Based on this assessment, we concluded that a decline in projected storage subscription rates as well as a reduction in the near-term projection of the reporting unit's profitability required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015.\nThe two-step goodwill impairment test for our storage and fuels reporting unit within the midstream operations segment resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of the full $14 million ($9 million, net of tax) of goodwill.\nGlossary\nFor our 2015 annual impairment test for all other reporting units, we performed the qualitative step 0 assessment described above and determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was required. The amounts of goodwill as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are provided below. Table 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Distribution operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Midstream operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill - December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill - December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Lived Assets We depreciate or amortize our long-lived and intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Currently, we have no significant indefinite-lived intangible assets. We assess our long-lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. Impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.\nOur agreement in June 2013 to acquire customer relationship intangible assets within our retail operations segment included a provision for the seller to provide an adjustment to the $32 million purchase price for attrition that exceeds historical levels. As a result of this provision, the seller paid us $5 million in January 2015, which is reflected as a reduction to our intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 and reduced the amortization for the same amount over the remaining useful life of 13.5 years.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe authoritative guidance to determine whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is voluminous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in our assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.\nThe authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging requires that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. However, if the derivative transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or normal sale, it is exempted from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.\nThe authoritative accounting guidance requires that changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, the guidance allows derivative gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the case of a fair value hedge, or to record the gains and losses in OCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the hedged transaction occurs in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, the guidance requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.\nNicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas utilize derivative instruments to hedge the price risk for the purchase of natural gas for customers. These derivatives are reflected at fair value and are not designated as accounting hedges. Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed through directly to customers, subject to review by the applicable state regulatory agencies, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nWe use derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to our results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas and to a lesser extent we hedge against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage our exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For the derivatives utilized in retail operations and wholesale services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in our results of operations in the period of change. Retail operations records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nGlossary\nAdditionally, as required by the authoritative guidance, we classify our derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of our derivative instruments incorporates various factors required under the guidance. These factors include:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>events specific to a given counterparty; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions we use in pricing our derivative assets or liabilities, we may experience a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in Note 3 and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 and Item 1, Business\u201d herein.\nContingencies\nOur accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of activities that are incurred in the normal course of business and generally relate to contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future.\nActual results may differ from estimates and our estimates can be, and often are, revised depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Changes in our estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Our contingencies are further discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nPension and Welfare Plans\nOur pension and welfare plans costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and welfare plan costs and liabilities on an annual basis and update them when appropriate. The critical actuarial assumptions used to develop the required estimates for our pension and welfare plans include the following key factors:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expected return on plan assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the market value of plan assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assumed discount rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assumed mortality table; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assumed health care costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and welfare plans costs. We estimate the expected return on plans assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater or less than the assumed rate, it does not affect that year's annual pension or welfare plan cost; rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or welfare plan costs.\nEquity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported results. For the AGL Plan, market performance affects our market-related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five-year smoothing weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five-year smoothing weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense.\nIn addition, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) or the MRVPA for the AGL Plan. The excess, if any, is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed the method we use to estimate the net periodic benefit cost for our pension and welfare plans. Historically, we estimated the net periodic benefit costs by applying a single weighted-average discount rate derived from a yield curve of high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve, to the forecasted future cash flows in each year for each plan. We have elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve of high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve, to the forecasted future cash flows in each year for each plan. We have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of costs. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in the net periodic benefit costs is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported.\nGlossary\nWe have accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, have accounted for it prospectively starting in 2016. The reduction in net periodic benefit cost for 2016 associated with this change in estimate is approximately $7 million.\nDuring 2015, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $48 million (pre-capitalization) related to our defined pension and welfare benefit plans. We estimate that in 2016, we will record net periodic pension and welfare benefit costs in the range of $32 million to $36 million (pre-capitalization), a $16 million to $12 million decrease compared to 2015. In calculating our estimated expenses for 2016, our actuarial consultant assumed the following expected return on plan assets and discount rates:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Welfare plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate - service cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal and retirement rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants. The following table illustrates the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions for our pension and welfare plans while holding all other assumptions constant: Table 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage-point change in assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease) in PBO / APBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease) in cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+ / - 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- / -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9) / 9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+ / - 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(157) / 193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14) / 15\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 5 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our pension and welfare plans.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nDeferred tax liabilities are estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.\nWith the sale of Tropical Shipping in the third quarter of 2014, we determined that the cumulative foreign earnings of that business would no longer be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Accordingly, we recognized income tax expense of $60 million in 2014 related to the cumulative foreign earnings for which no tax liabilities had been previously recorded, resulting from our repatriation of $86 million in cash.\nFor state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition, we operate within multiple tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure and, in our opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years reported.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our expectations of future taxable income and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis. We had a $19 million valuation allowance on $312 million of deferred tax assets ($249 million long-term and $63 million current) as of December 31, 2015, reflecting the expectation that a majority of these assets will be realized. Our gross long-term deferred tax liability totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2015. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our taxes.\nWe are required to determine whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on our tax return should be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertainty in income taxes only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nAdditionally, we recognize accrued interest related to uncertainty in income taxes in interest expense, and penalties in operating expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have a liability recorded for payment of interest and penalties associated with uncertainty in income taxes.\nGlossary\nAccounting Developments\nSee Accounting Developments\u201d in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nWe are an energy services holding company whose principal business is the safe, reliable and cost-effective distribution of natural gas in seven states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida, Tennessee and Maryland - through our seven natural gas distribution utilities. We are also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to our primary business. We have four reportable segments - distribution operations, retail operations, wholesale services and midstream operations - and one non-reportable segment - other. These segments are consistent with how management views and operates our business. Amounts shown in this Item 7, unless otherwise indicated, exclude discontinued operations. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

We will remain focused on safe and efficient operations across all of our businesses, improving customer satisfaction and awareness of the benefits of our product and investment in infrastructure for the future. Several of our specific business objectives are detailed as follows:\n \u2022 Distribution Operations: Invest necessary capital to enhance and maintain safety and reliability in delivering natural gas; remain an efficiency leader within the industry while maintaining a focus on customer satisfaction; expand the natural gas distribution system and educate energy consumers on the benefits of converting to natural gas. We intend to continue investing in our regulatory infrastructure programs to minimize the lag in recovery of our capital. We continue to effectively manage costs and leverage our shared services model across our businesses to combat inflationary effects. \n \u2022 Retail Operations: Maintain our current customer base in Georgia and Illinois while continuing to expand into other profitable retail markets and expand our warranty businesses through partnership opportunities with affiliates and third parties. We will focus on products that are responsive to our customers' needs. \n \u2022 Wholesale Services: We continue to position our business to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility and third-party customers and to hedge natural gas prices to manage costs effectively, reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage relative to other marketers. \n \u2022 Midstream Operations: Invest in natural gas based projects, some of which remain subject to regulatory approvals, along with our existing pipelines and storage to support our efforts to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to our customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability and generate economic development in the areas served. For additional information on our pipeline projects, see Note 3 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein and Item 1, Business\u201d under the caption Midstream Operations.\u201d  Additionally, we intend to maintain our strong balance sheet and liquidity profile, solid investment grade ratings and our commitment to sustainable annual dividend growth. For additional information on our reportable segments, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein and Item 1, Business.\u201d\nPerformance and Non-GAAP Measures We evaluate segment performance using the measures of EBIT and operating margin. EBIT includes operating income and other income and expenses and excludes interest expense and income taxes, which we evaluate on a consolidated basis. Operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues minus cost of goods sold and revenue tax expense in distribution operations. Operating margin excludes operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, merger-related expenses, goodwill impairment charges and the gain or loss on the sale of our assets, which are included in our calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe believe that the presentation of operating margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of goods sold and revenue tax expenses can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to our customers. We further believe that operating margin at our retail operations, wholesale services and midstream operations segments allows us to focus on a direct measure of operating margin before overhead costs.\nGlossary\nWe present the non-GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share - as adjusted, which exclude merger-related expenses and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge at midstream operations. As we do not regularly engage in transactions of the magnitude of the proposed merger with Southern Company, and consequently do not regularly incur merger expenses of correlative size, we believe presenting diluted earnings per share excluding merger expenses provides investors with an additional measure of our core operating performance. We also have chosen to exclude a non-cash goodwill impairment related to our midstream operations segment because management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our core operating performance without this non-cash item.\nOperating margin and diluted earnings per share - as adjusted should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful indicators of, our operating performance than net income attributable to AGL Resources, operating income or diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our operating margin and diluted earnings per share - as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSummary of Results:\nThe table below reconciles (i) operating revenues and operating margin to operating income, (ii) EBIT to income before income taxes and net income and (iii) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share - as adjusted to GAAP diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations, together with other consolidated financial information for the last three years.

declined significantly in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower natural gas prices and lower volumes of gas sold to customers due to weather in 2015 that was warmer than the extreme cold experienced in 2014. \n (2) Adjusted for Nicor Gas' revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to customers. \n (3) Operating expenses for 2015 include $44 million of merger-related expenses and a $14 million goodwill impairment charge. \n (4) In September 2014, we sold Tropical Shipping. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information.  2015 Results In 2015, our income from continuing operations attributable to AGL Resources decreased by $209 million, or 37%, compared to 2014. This decrease was due primarily to lower consolidated EBIT of $350 million, largely driven by wholesale services, and was partially offset by lower income tax expense of $137 million due to lower earnings in 2015.\nIncluded in the 2015 EBIT were $44 million of merger-related expenses and a $14 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge at our midstream operations segment. Excluding these items and the $314 million year-over-year change in results of wholesale services, EBIT increased by $22 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the following:\n \u2022 $34 million in additional operating margin at distribution operations from regulatory infrastructure programs, partially offset by $19 million in higher depreciation expense. \n \u2022 $19 million in additional operating margin at retail operations due to the recovery of prior year hedge losses and lower current year derivative losses resulting from changes in natural gas prices. \nGlossary\n \u2022 These increases were partially offset by weather at distribution operations and retail operations due to significantly warmer temperatures in 2015, compared to 2014.  Wholesale services reported $108 million of EBIT in 2015, compared to $422 million in 2014, a decrease of $314 million. In 2014, wholesale services benefited from increased natural gas volatility that was generated by significantly colder-than-normal weather through higher commercial activity and net hedge gains. Wholesale services continued to benefit from market volatility in 2015 and generated EBIT that was significantly higher than its average economic earnings expectation of $50 million.\n2014 Results In 2014, our income from continuing operations attributable to AGL Resources increased by $272 million, or 94%, compared to 2013. This increase was primarily the result of the following:\n \u2022 Significantly higher commercial activity primarily in the first quarter of 2014, and mark-to-market hedge gains, net of LOCOM adjustments at wholesale services in 2014 from price volatility generated by colder-than-normal weather, which increased operating margin by $462 million compared to 2013. \n \u2022 Increased operating margin at distribution operations and retail operations of $50 million mainly due to significantly colder-than-normal weather in 2014 as well as customer usage and customer growth. We also achieved growth as a result of our 2013 acquisitions and expansion into additional markets at retail operations. \n \u2022 These increases were partially offset by a decrease in margin of $10 million at midstream operations primarily due to a retained fuel true-up at one of our storage facilities from a reduction in the estimated cavern capacity as a result of naturally occurring shrinkage, as well as lower contracted firm rates at Jefferson Island and Central Valley. \n \u2022 Favorability year-over-year was negatively impacted by higher incentive compensation expenses primarily related to higher earnings in 2014 and increased outside services expenses of $49 million, and an $8 million higher pre-tax gain in 2013 related to the sale of Compass Energy. \n \u2022 Our income tax expense from continuing operations increased by $173 million for 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher consolidated earnings. The increase was primarily a result of increased earnings at wholesale services.  The variances for each reportable segment are contained within the year-over-year discussions on the following pages.\nProposed Merger With Southern Company In August 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Southern Company, which, based on the number of common shares and the fair value of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015, reflects an estimated business enterprise value of AGL Resources of $13.0 billion, including a total equity value of $7.9 billion. When the merger becomes effective, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2016, each share of our common stock, other than certain excluded shares, will convert into the right to receive $66 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the approval of certain state utility and other regulatory agencies. On November 19, 2015, the proposed merger was approved by our shareholders at a special meeting. At closing, the transaction is expected to create the second largest utility in the U.S. by customer base and we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company and continue to maintain our own management team. For additional information relating to this transaction, see Note 2 and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" herein for information on the merger-related risks.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues We generate the majority of our operating revenues through the sale, distribution and storage of natural gas. Our consolidated revenues include an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed, but not yet billed to our customers from the date of the last bill to the end of the reporting period. No individual customer or industry accounts for a significant portion of our revenues.

Operating metrics Our operating metrics of weather impact, customer count, natural gas volumes and the seasonality of our operating results are presented below.\nWeather We measure weather and its effect on our business by using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for gas on our distribution systems. With the exception of Nicor Gas and Florida City Gas, we have regulatory mechanisms, such as weather normalization, which limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of our utilities' respective service areas. However, our utility customers in Illinois and our retail operations customers in Georgia can be impacted by warmer- or colder-than-normal weather. Additionally, we utilize weather hedges at distribution operations and retail operations to reduce negative earnings impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather, while retaining all of the earnings upside in the event of colder-than-normal weather for distribution operations in Illinois and most of the earnings upside for our retail operations.

In 2015, we experienced weather in Illinois that was 7% warmer-than-normal and 17% warmer than 2014. In the first quarter of 2015 weather in Illinois was 10% colder-than-normal, while weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 28% warmer-than-normal in Illinois. Since we hedged our Illinois weather risk for these quarterly periods separately and hedged only exposure for warmer-than-normal weather, the EBIT impact of weather for the year was favorable by $2 million, net of the impact of our weather hedging for distribution operations. The colder-than-normal weather in Illinois in 2014 primarily drove an EBIT increase of $22 million, for distribution operations, based on 10-year normal weather. For our retail operations in Georgia, weather in 2015 was 16% warmer-than-normal and 24% warmer than the same period last year. Similar to our strategy for distribution operations, because we hedged weather risk for our retail operations for the first and fourth quarters separately and hedged exposure for warmer-than-normal weather, the EBIT impact of weather for the year was slightly unfavorable by $1 million in 2015. The colder-than-normal weather increased EBIT by $8 million in 2014 compared to expected levels based on 10-year normal weather for our retail operations.\nCustomers The number of customers at distribution operations and energy customers at retail operations can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions and competition from alternative fuels. Our energy customers at retail operations are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois. Our customer metrics presented in the following table highlight the average number of customers to which we provided services for the specified periods.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014 change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013 change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>#\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>#\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution operations customers (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy customers (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service contracts (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market share in Georgia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) In 2014, we implemented a process change at Nicor Gas that adversely impacted our customer count. This had the effect of immaterial growth for Nicor Gas compared to 2013. \n (2) The increase from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to the addition of approximately 33,000 residential and commercial customer relationships acquired in Illinois in June 2013. \n (3) Includes approximately 43,000 customer warranty contracts acquired in Connecticut and Massachusetts in the second half of 2015.  We anticipate overall customer growth trends at distribution operations for 2015 to continue in 2016 as we expect continued improvement in the economy, the related housing market and low natural gas prices. We use a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. These efforts include adding residential customers, multifamily complexes and commercial and industrial customers who use natural gas for purposes other than heating, as well as evaluating and launching new natural gas related programs, products and services to enhance customer growth, mitigate customer attrition and increase operating revenues. These programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. We also target customer conversions to natural gas from other energy sources, emphasizing the pricing advantage of natural gas. These programs focus on premises that could be connected to our distribution system at little or no cost to the customer. In cases where conversion cost can be a disincentive, we may employ rebate programs and other assistance to address customer cost issues.\nIn 2016, we intend to continue efforts in our retail operations segment to enter into targeted markets and expand energy customers and service contracts. We anticipate this expansion will provide growth opportunities in future years.\nGlossary\nVolume Our natural gas volume metrics for distribution operations and retail operations, as shown in the following table, illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas compared to the prior year.

This allows our natural gas storage business to generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, but retain some consistency with its earnings and maximize the value of its investments.\nOur midstream operations storage business is cyclical, and the abundant supply of natural gas in recent years and resulting lack of market and price volatility have negatively impacted the profitability of our storage facilities. The rates at which we may re-contract expiring capacity may not be as high as expected and may also remain below historical averages in 2016. The prices for natural gas storage capacity are expected to increase as supply and demand quantities reach equilibrium with continued economic improvement, expected exports of LNG, and projected demand increases in response to low prices and expanded uses for natural gas. The following table contains the overall monthly average firm subscription rates per facility and amount of firm capacity subscription for all periods presented. These amounts exclude 5 Bcf contracted by Sequent as of December 31, 2015, at an average monthly rate of $0.080 and 7 Bcf as of December 31, 2014, at an average monthly rate of $0.050.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average rates\n(per dekatherm)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Firm capacity under subscription (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average rates\n(per dekatherm)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Firm capacity under subscription (Bcf)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jefferson Island\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golden Triangle\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Valley\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeasonality of our Results During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to our distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain Consolidated Balance Sheets items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenue, inventories and short-term debt. However, these items are comparable when reviewing our annual results. Our base operating expenses, excluding cost of goods sold, interest expense, bad debt expense and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, our operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.

Distribution Operations Our distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the states we serve. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs, such as depreciation, interest, maintenance and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders.\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, our second largest utility, the earnings of our regulated utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas and general economic conditions that may impact our customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. We have various weather mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in their respective service areas.

Retail operations is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts. In 2015, we recovered $15 million of prior period hedge losses and LOCOM adjustments as the underlying transactions were recognized at higher margins. The net effect is that the transactions ultimately resulted in the expected economic outcome at the time the derivatives were executed to manage the associated price risk.\nGlossary\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT - prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recovery of hedge losses (gains)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in value of unrealized derivatives as a result of NYMEX natural gas prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LOCOM adjustments, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Improved warranty margins\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in 2015 due to customer mix.

We have positioned the business to generate positive economic earnings even under low volatility market conditions that can result from a number of factors, including weather fluctuations and changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the country. However, when market price volatility increases as we experienced in both 2015 and 2014, we are well positioned to capture significant value and generate stronger results. We principally use physical and financial arrangements to reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in market conditions and changing commodity prices. These economic hedges may not qualify, or are not designated for, hedge accounting treatment. As a result, our reported earnings for wholesale services reflect changes in the fair values of certain derivatives. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as gains or losses within our operating revenues.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT - prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in commercial activity largely driven by the transportation and storage portfolios in the Northeast and Midwest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(304\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in value of storage derivatives as a result of fluctuations in NYMEX natural gas prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in value of transportation and forward commodity derivatives from price movements related to natural gas transportation positions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LOCOM adjustments, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease due to sale of Compass Energy in May 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase related to incentive compensation expenses driven by higher earnings and other costs in 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease due to sale of Compass Energy in May 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in other income, primarily related to the gain on sale of Compass Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBIT - current year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table illustrates the components of wholesale services' operating margin for the periods presented.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial activity recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on storage derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory LOCOM adjustment, net of estimated current period recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on transportation and forward commodity derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlossary\nChange in commercial activity The commercial activity at wholesale services includes recognized storage and transportation values that were generated in prior periods, which reflect the impact of prior period hedge gains and losses as associated physical transactions occur in the period. Additionally, the commercial activity includes operating margin generated and recognized in the current period. The significant variances in commercial activity between 2015 and 2014 and between 2014 and 2013 are due largely to the recognition of significantly higher operating margin in 2014 associated with our transportation and storage portfolios, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions, from price volatility generated by the extreme and prolonged cold weather in that year. Additionally, 2015 operating margin was lower resulting from the withdrawal of storage inventory hedged at the end of 2014 relating to 2015 withdrawals that was included in the storage withdrawal schedule with a value of $(5) million as of December 31, 2014 compared to the comparable measure in 2014 of $28 million related to inventory hedged at the end of 2013. Operating margin in 2014 was also higher resulting from mark-to-market accounting derivative losses at the end of 2013. These mark-to-market losses were recovered in 2014 when the underlying related transactions were recognized at their higher values.\nChange in storage and transportation derivatives Continued price volatility in 2015 benefited wholesale services' portfolio of pipeline transportation and storage capacity assets throughout the U.S., primarily in the Northeast market. Although we do not expect this high level of price volatility to continue, we see the potential for market fundamentals indicating some level of increased volatility that would continue to benefit wholesale services should this occur. Storage derivative gains in 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to declines in natural gas prices applicable to the locations of our specific storage assets. These derivative gains were partially offset by LOCOM adjustments to natural gas inventories, net of estimated hedging recoveries.\nGains in our transportation and forward commodity derivative positions in 2015 are primarily due to the narrowing of transportation basis spreads associated with warmer-than-normal weather, which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points, primarily in the Northeast region. Gains in our transportation and forward commodity derivative positions in 2014 are primarily the result of narrowing transportation basis spreads. Transportation and forward commodity hedge losses in 2013 were the result of widening transportation basis spreads, and were largely recovered in 2014 with the physical flow of natural gas and utilization of the contracted transportation capacity.\nWe account for natural gas stored in inventory differently than the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio. The natural gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas daily or spot prices at the end of the year. The derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period using forward natural gas prices. This difference in accounting treatment can result in volatility in wholesale services' reported results, even though the expected net operating revenue and expected economic value are substantially unchanged since the date the transactions were initiated. These accounting timing differences also affect the comparability of wholesale services' period-over-period results, since changes in forward NYMEX prices do not increase and decrease on a consistent basis from year to year. Largely as a result of moderate weather in the fourth quarters of both 2015 and 2014 leading to significant decreases in natural gas prices, wholesale services recorded LOCOM adjustments of $19 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFor our natural gas transportation portfolio, we enter into transportation capacity contracts with interstate and intrastate pipelines for the delivery of natural gas between receipt and delivery points in future periods. We purchase natural gas for transportation when the market price we pay for gas at a receipt point plus the cost of transportation capacity required to deliver the gas to the delivery point is less than the sales price at the delivery point. The difference between the prices at the receipt and delivery points is the transportation basis or location spread. Similar to our storage transactions, we attempt to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our transportation portfolio by using derivative instruments to reduce the risk associated with future changes in the price of natural gas at the receipt and delivery points. We utilize futures contracts or OTC derivatives to hedge both the commodity price risk relative to the market price at the receipt point and the market price at the delivery point to substantially protect the operating revenue that we will ultimately realize once the natural gas is received, delivered and sold.\nVolatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on our customer rates, our long-term competitive position against other energy sources and the ability of our wholesale services segment to capture value from location and seasonal spreads. During both the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, we experienced increased price volatility brought on largely by colder weather and supply constraints in the Northeast and Midwest regions, which enabled us to capture value under these market conditions. Commercial activity in 2014 was particularly favorable due to significant natural gas price volatility, largely the result of significantly colder-than-normal weather primarily in the first quarter.\nWhile market conditions in 2014 and early 2015 experienced more natural gas price volatility, in the near term, we anticipate low volatility in certain areas of our portfolio, but expect a continuation of some volatility in the supply-constrained Northeast corridor. Over the longer term, we expect volatility to be low to moderate and locational or transportation spreads to decrease over time as new pipelines are built to reduce the bottleneck in the currently constrained shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these pipelines are delayed or not built, volatility could increase. While natural gas supply increased during the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 Heating Seasons in the U.S., it was not enough to meet the increased demand, resulting in storage levels that were lower than historical periods. The warm 2015 winter weather experienced in the U.S. resulted in record natural gas inventories that contributed to reduced natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment,\nGlossary\nincluding the significant drop in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers and reduced levels of natural gas production. Further, if economic conditions continue to improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.\nThe expected natural gas withdrawals from storage, including the expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with our transportation portfolio at December 31, 2015 are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal from storage and the physical flow of natural gas between contracted transportation receipt and delivery points. Our expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, and other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt and delivery charges, but are net of the estimated impact of profit sharing under our asset management agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2015. A portion of wholesale services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues, timing notwithstanding. The timing of future withdrawals may change in response to changes in future economic value or other factors.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Storage withdrawal schedule\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total storage\n(in Bcf) (WACOG $2.27)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected net\noperating gains (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Physical transportation transactions -\nexpected net operating gains (losses) (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents expected operating gains from planned storage withdrawals associated with existing inventory positions and could change as wholesale services adjusts its daily injection and withdrawal plans in response to changes in future market conditions and forward NYMEX price fluctuations. \n (2) Represents the periods associated with the transportation derivative (gains) losses during which the derivatives will be settled and the physical transportation transactions will occur that offset the derivative (gains) losses recognized in 2014 and 2015.

The liquidity required to fund these short-term needs is generally provided by our operating activities, and any needs not met are primarily satisfied with short-term borrowings under our commercial paper programs, which are supported by the AGL Credit Facility and the Nicor Gas Credit Facility. For more information on the seasonality of our short-term borrowings, see Short-term Debt\u201d later in this section. The need for long-term capital is driven primarily by capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt. Periodically, we raise funds supporting our long-term cash needs from the issuance of long-term debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs in a cost-effective manner.\nOur financing activities, including long-term and short-term debt and equity, are subject to customary approval or review by the state agencies in which we conduct business as well as the FERC. A substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flows is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us may be subject to regulation. By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. Additionally, Elizabethtown Gas is restricted by their dividend policy as established by the New Jersey BPU in the amount it can dividend to AGL Resources to the extent of 70% of its quarterly net income.\nWe believe the amounts available to us under our long-term debt and credit facilities as well as through the issuance of additional debt, combined with cash provided by operating activities will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, anticipated debt redemptions, interest payments on debt obligations, dividend payments and other cash needs through the next several years.\nThe ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and our debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, substantially depends upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which we are unable to control. These factors include, among others, regulatory changes, the price of and demand for natural gas, and operational risks.\nOur capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of debt and equity securities. This strategy includes active management of the percentage of total debt relative to total capitalization, as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities and maintenance of an appropriate mix of debt with fixed and floating interest rates. Our variable debt target is 20% to 45% of total debt. As of December 31, 2015, our variable-rate debt was $1.3 billion, or 28%, of our total debt, compared to $1.5 billion, or 31%, as of December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to reduced commercial paper borrowings resulting from warmer weather that resulted in lower natural gas sales as well as the lower cost of gas in 2015. For more information on our debt, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nOn November 18, 2015, AGL Capital issued $250 million in 10-year senior notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. The net proceeds from the senior notes of $248 million, which are guaranteed by AGL Capital, were used to repay a portion of AGL Capital's commercial paper, including $200 million we borrowed to repay senior notes that matured on January 15, 2015.\nIn January 2015, we executed $800 million in notional value of 10 year and 30 year fixed-rate forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge potential interest rate volatility prior to the anticipated issuances of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in 2016. We designated the forward-starting interest rate swaps, which mature on the respective debt issuance dates, as cash flow hedges. We settled $200 million of these interest rate swaps on November 18, 2015, in conjunction with the aforementioned senior note issuance. The remaining $600 million of interest rate swaps, which had a fair value of $9 million as of December 31, 2015, are expected to be settled in 2016. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption Interest Rate Risk\u201d for additional information.\nOur objective remains to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile, solid investment grade ratings and annual dividend growth. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate our need to increase available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements, including the impact of changes in natural gas prices, liquidity requirements established by rating agencies, acquisitions and other factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for additional information on items that could impact our liquidity and capital resource requirements.\nShort-term Debt The following table provides additional information on our short-term debt throughout the year.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-end balance outstanding (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Daily average balance outstanding (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minimum balance outstanding (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Largest balance outstanding (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper - AGL Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>787\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper - Nicor Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) As of December 31, 2015. \n (2) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. \nGlossary\nThe largest, minimum and daily average balances borrowed under our commercial paper programs are important when assessing the intra-period fluctuations of our short-term borrowings and potential liquidity risk. The fluctuations are due to our seasonal cash requirements to fund working capital needs, in particular the purchase of natural gas inventory, margin calls and collateral posting requirements. The largest and minimum balances outstanding for each debt instrument occurred at different times during the period. Consequently, the total balances are not indicative of actual borrowings on any one day during the period. Cash requirements generally increase between June and December as we purchase natural gas in advance of the Heating Season. The timing differences between payment to our suppliers for natural gas purchases and recovery of costs from our customers through their monthly bills can significantly affect our cash requirements. Our short-term debt balances are typically reduced during the Heating Season, as a significant portion of our current assets, primarily natural gas inventories, are converted into cash.\nOur commercial paper borrowings are supported by the $1.3 billion AGL Credit Facility and $700 million Nicor Gas Credit Facility, which can be drawn upon to meet working capital and other general corporate needs. However, the Nicor Gas Credit Facility can only be used for the working capital needs of Nicor Gas. The interest rates payable on borrowings under these facilities are calculated at either the alternative base rate plus an applicable interest margin or LIBOR plus an applicable interest margin. The applicable interest margin used in both interest rate calculations will vary according to AGL Capital's and Nicor Gas' current credit ratings. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under either credit facility.\nThe timing of natural gas withdrawals is dependent on the weather and natural gas market conditions, both of which impact the price of natural gas. Increasing natural gas commodity prices can significantly impact our commercial paper borrowings. Based on our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015, and our maximum 70% debt to total capitalization allowed under our financial covenants, we could borrow an additional $798 million of commercial paper under the AGL Credit Facility and an additional $162 million of commercial paper under the Nicor Gas Credit Facility. As a result, based on current natural gas prices and our expected injection plan, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover our working capital needs.\nIn October 2015, we entered into agreements to amend and extend our credit facilities. Under the terms of these agreements, we extended the maturity dates of the AGL Credit Facility and Nicor Gas Credit Facility to November 9, 2018 and December 14, 2018, respectively. One of the banks elected not to participate in this extension and its total commitment of $75 million will continue through the fourth quarter of 2017. We also modified the credit facilities to provide for the limited consent by the lenders to the proposed merger with Southern Company. Additionally, we made similar changes to our Bank Rate Mode Covenants Agreement.\nThe lenders under our credit facilities and lines of credit are major financial institutions with $2.2 billion of committed balances and all had investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2015. It is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if a lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency. However, based on our current assessment of our lenders' creditworthiness, we believe the risk of lender default is minimal. Commercial paper borrowings reduce availability of these credit facilities.\nLong-term Debt Our long-term debt matures more than one year from December 31, 2015 and consists of medium-term notes; Series A, Series B, and Series C, which we issued under an indenture dated December 1989; senior notes; first mortgage bonds and gas facility revenue bonds. Our long-term cash requirements primarily depend upon our level of capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities and decisions to refinance long-term debt. The following table summarizes our long-term debt issuances and refinancings over the last three years. Table 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Issuance / refinance date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Term\n(in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas facility revenue bonds (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10-20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Floating rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of AGL Capital's commercial paper, including $200 million we borrowed to repay senior notes that matured on January 15, 2015. \n (2) The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of AGL Capital's commercial paper, including $225 million we borrowed to repay senior notes that matured on April 15, 2013. \n (3) There were no cash receipts or payments in connection with the refinancing of these gas facility revenue bonds.  Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and our ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing are directly impacted by our credit ratings, as well as the availability of financial markets. Credit ratings are important to our counterparties when we engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. It is our long-term objective to maintain or improve our credit ratings in order to manage our existing financing costs and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and may periodically change. The rating agencies regularly review our performance and financial condition and reevaluate their ratings of our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, our corporate ratings and our ratings outlook. There is no guarantee that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of other ratings.\nGlossary\nFactors we consider important to assessing our credit ratings include our Consolidated Balance Sheets, leverage, capital spending, earnings, cash flow generation, available liquidity and overall business risks. We do not have any triggering events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any agreements that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. A downgrade in our current ratings, particularly below investment grade, would increase our borrowing costs and could limit our access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. As of December 31, 2015, if our credit rating had fallen below investment grade, we would have been required to provide collateral of $19 million to continue conducting business with certain customers.\nThe table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AGL Resources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nicor Gas\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fitch (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fitch\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> P-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> P-1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> A2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratings outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) During the third quarter of 2015, S&P revised both AGL Resources' and Nicor Gas' ratings outlooks to positive from stable and Fitch revised AGL Resources' outlook to positive. \n (2) Credit ratings are for AGL Capital, whose obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by AGL Resources. \n (3) Moody's downgraded AGL Capital's senior unsecured rating to Baa1 from A3 during the third quarter of 2015.  Default Provisions As indicated below, our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment or similar actions.\n \u2022 Our credit facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to the failure to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness and a change of control; \n \u2022 Our credit facilities contain certain non-financial covenants that, among other things, restrict liens and encumbrances, loans and investments, acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, asset dispositions, mergers and consolidations, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements; and \n \u2022 Our credit facilities each include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 70% at the end of any fiscal month. However, we typically seek to maintain these ratios at levels between 50% and 60%, except for temporary increases related to the timing of acquisition and financing activities.  We were in compliance with all of our debt provisions and covenants, both financial and non-financial, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. For additional information on our default provisions, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nCash Flows\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows using the indirect method, under which we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, changes in derivative instrument assets and liabilities, deferred income taxes, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses on the sale of assets and changes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for working capital during the period. The following table provides a summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows for the last three years.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) (1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,027\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(876\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(366\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents - continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents - discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents (including held for sale) at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents (including held for sale) at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less cash and cash equivalents held for sale at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents (excluding held for sale) at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts for 2014 and 2013 include activity for discontinued operations. \nGlossary\nCash Flow from Operating Activities 2015 compared to 2014 Our net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2015 was $1.4 billion, an increase of $726 million, or 111%, from 2014. The increase was primarily related to (i) higher working capital needs during the prior year that was driven by higher natural gas prices and volumes delivered as well as the timing of recoveries of related gas costs from customers, (ii) cash provided by derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities primarily as a result of the decrease in forward NYMEX prices year-over-year and (iii) a 2014 tax refund of $150 million received in January 2015 related to the prior year extension of bonus depreciation late in 2014 (the 2015 tax refund related to the extension of bonus depreciation in late 2015 is expected in early 2016). These increases were partially offset by (i) lower earnings year-over-year largely attributable to warmer weather than experienced in 2014, and (ii) energy marketing receivables and payables, due to less cash received in 2015 from the prior year.\n2014 compared to 2013 Our net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2014 was $655 million, a decrease of $316 million or 33% from 2013. The decrease was primarily related to (i) income taxes, largely driven by the utilization of a prior period net operating loss that reduced the 2013 tax obligation combined with taxes paid in 2014 due to increased earnings and the repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings of Tropical Shipping, (ii) increased cash for inventory and (iii) trade payables, other than energy marketing, due to higher accrued volumes in December 2013 compared to December 2012. These decreases were partially offset by increases primarily related to (i) higher earnings year over year largely attributed to significantly colder-than-normal weather in 2014 and increased price volatility that enabled us to capture value in wholesale services and (ii) net energy marketing receivables and payables, due to higher cash received in 2014 from the prior year.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities Our net cash flow used in investing activities in 2015 increased $522 million, or 103%, from 2014, primarily as a result of increased infrastructure investment, primarily relating to Nicor Gas' Investing in Illinois program, combined with increased spending for other rate-based investments at distribution operations. Additionally, the variance was driven by the $225 million proceeds from the sale of Tropical Shipping during the third quarter of 2014. Our estimated PP&E expenditures for 2016 and our actual PP&E expenditures incurred in 2015, 2014 and 2013 are presented in the following table.\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New construction and infrastructure improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory infrastructure programs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Programs that update or expand our distribution systems to improve system reliability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage, pipelines and LNG facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Underground natural gas storage facilities, pipeline infrastructure and LNG production and transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primarily includes information technology and building and leasehold improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes Investing in Illinois at Nicor Gas, STRIDE at Atlanta Gas Light, SAVE at Virginia Natural Gas, AIR at Elizabethtown Gas and SAFE at Florida City Gas.  The 2015 increase in PP&E expenditures of $258 million, or 34%, was due to increased spending of $281 million related to infrastructure improvements on our Investing in Illinois program. This was partially offset by decreased spending related to our new construction projects.\nOur PP&E expenditures were $769 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $731 million for the same period in 2013. The increase of $38 million or 5% was due to increased spending of $84 million primarily related to new construction and infrastructure improvements at our utilities. This was partially offset by a $46 million net decrease in expenditures for our regulatory infrastructure programs largely due to PRP at Atlanta Gas Light, which ended in 2013, offset by increased spending on our other regulatory infrastructure programs that primarily included $57 million at Atlanta Gas Light for i-VPR, $24 million at Elizabethtown Gas for AIR and $22 million at Nicor Gas for Investing in Illinois.\nOur estimated expenditures for 2016 include discretionary spending for capital projects principally within the distribution business, regulatory infrastructure programs, natural gas storage and other categories. We continuously evaluate whether or not to proceed with these projects, reviewing them in relation to various factors, including our authorized returns on rate base, other returns on invested capital for projects of a similar nature, capital structure and credit ratings, among others. We make adjustments to our discretionary expenditures as necessary based upon these factors.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities Our net cash flow used in financing activities in 2015 increased $142 million, or 63%, from 2014 primarily as a result of the net repayments of our commercial paper during 2015, partially offset by the excess of proceeds from our issuance of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 over the senior notes that matured in the first quarter of 2015. For more information on our financing activities, see \"Short-term Debt\" and \"Long-term Debt\" within Item 7 under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nNoncontrolling Interest We recorded cash distributions for SouthStar's dividends to Piedmont of $18 million in 2015, $17 million in 2014 and $17 million in 2013 as financing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nDividends on Common Stock Our common stock dividend payments were $244 million in 2015, $233 million in 2014 and $222 million in 2013. The increases were primarily due to the annual dividend increase of $0.08 per share in each of 2015 and 2014.\nGlossary\nOff-balance sheet arrangements We have certain guarantees, as further described in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. We believe the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. We also have authorized unrecognized ratemaking amounts, primarily composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain of our regulatory infrastructure programs, which are not reflected within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of business that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue-producing activities. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. The following table illustrates our expected future contractual obligation payments and commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

rider mechanisms. \n (2) In accordance with GAAP, these items are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n (3) Includes charges recoverable through a natural gas cost recovery mechanism or alternatively billed to marketers and demand charges associated with Sequent. The gas supply balance includes amounts for Nicor Gas and SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 37 Bcf at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2015, and is valued at $76 million. As we do for certain of our affiliates, we provide guarantees to certain gas suppliers for SouthStar in support of payment obligations. \n (4) Floating rate interest charges are calculated based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2015 and the maturity date of the underlying debt instrument. As of December 31, 2015, we have $49 million of accrued interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets that will be paid in 2016. \n (5) We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with GAAP. However, this lease accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein. Our operating leases are primarily for real estate. \n (6) Represent fixed-fee minimum payments for Sequent's affiliated asset management agreements. \n (7) We provide guarantees to certain municipalities and other agencies and certain gas suppliers of SouthStar in support of payment obligations.  Standby letters of credit and performance/surety bonds. We also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. We would expect to fund these contingent financial commitments with operating and financing cash flows.\nPension and welfare obligations. Generally, our pension plan funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Pension Protection Act. We calculate any required pension contributions using the traditional unit credit cost method; however, additional voluntary contributions are periodically made. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. The contributions represent the portion of the welfare costs for which we are responsible under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory agencies.\nThe state regulatory agencies in all of our jurisdictions, except Illinois, have phase-ins that defer a portion of the retirement benefit expenses for retirement plans other than pensions for future recovery. We recorded a regulatory asset for these future recoveries of $125 million as of December 31, 2015 and $122 million as of December 31, 2014. In Illinois, all accrued retirement plan expenses are recovered through base rates. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information about our pension and welfare plans.\nGlossary\nIn both 2015 and 2014, no contributions were required to our qualified pension plan. Based on the estimated funded status of the AGL Plan, we do not expect any required contribution to the plan in 2016. We may, at times, elect to contribute additional amounts to the AGL Plan in accordance with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Those judgments and estimates have a significant effect on our financial statements, primarily due to the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We frequently reevaluate our judgments and estimates that are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which represent those that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty, judgment and complexity. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nAccounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries\nAt December 31, 2015, our regulatory assets were $738 million and regulatory liabilities were $1.7 billion. At December 31, 2014, our regulatory assets were $714 million and regulatory liabilities were $1.7 billion. Our natural gas distribution operations and certain regulated transmission and storage operations meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity under GAAP. Accordingly, the financial results of these operations reflect the effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject.\nAs a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under GAAP are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable that they can be recovered through rates. The periods in which revenues or expenses are recognized are impacted by regulation. In instances where other GAAP accounting treatment supersedes Accounting Standards Codification 980 - Regulated Operations, we apply the other GAAP accounting treatment. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations.\nDiscontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses, as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Assets and liabilities recognized as a result of rate regulation would be written off in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred. A write-off of all our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2015 would result in 5% and 16% decreases in total assets and total liabilities, respectively. For more information on our regulated assets and liabilities, see Note 3 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets\nGoodwill We do not amortize our goodwill, but test it annually for impairment at the reporting unit level during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.\nAs part of our impairment test, an initial qualitative step 0 assessment is made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events and events specific to each reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nStep 1 of the two-step goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the result of our step 1 test reveals that the estimated fair value is below its carrying value we proceed with step 2.\nStep 2 of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill, which is calculated as the residual amount from the reporting unit's overall fair value after assigning fair values to its assets and liabilities under a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination, to its carrying value. Based on the result of the step 2 test, we record a goodwill impairment charge for any excess of carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill.\nWhile preparing our third quarter 2015 financial statements, and in connection with our 2016 annual budget process, we assessed various market factors and projections prepared by both internal and external sources related to subscription rates for contracting capacity at our storage facilities as well as the profitability of our storage and fuels reporting unit. Based on this assessment, we concluded that a decline in projected storage subscription rates as well as a reduction in the near-term projection of the reporting unit's profitability required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015.\nThe two-step goodwill impairment test for our storage and fuels reporting unit within the midstream operations segment resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of the full $14 million ($9 million, net of tax) of goodwill.\nGlossary\nFor our 2015 annual impairment test for all other reporting units, we performed the qualitative step 0 assessment described above and determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was required. The amounts of goodwill as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are provided below.

Currently, we have no significant indefinite-lived intangible assets. We assess our long-lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. Impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.\nOur agreement in June 2013 to acquire customer relationship intangible assets within our retail operations segment included a provision for the seller to provide an adjustment to the $32 million purchase price for attrition that exceeds historical levels. As a result of this provision, the seller paid us $5 million in January 2015, which is reflected as a reduction to our intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 and reduced the amortization for the same amount over the remaining useful life of 13.5 years.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe authoritative guidance to determine whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is voluminous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in our assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.\nThe authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging requires that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. However, if the derivative transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or normal sale, it is exempted from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.\nThe authoritative accounting guidance requires that changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, the guidance allows derivative gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the case of a fair value hedge, or to record the gains and losses in OCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the hedged transaction occurs in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, the guidance requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.\nNicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas utilize derivative instruments to hedge the price risk for the purchase of natural gas for customers. These derivatives are reflected at fair value and are not designated as accounting hedges. Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed through directly to customers, subject to review by the applicable state regulatory agencies, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nWe use derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to our results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas and to a lesser extent we hedge against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage our exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For the derivatives utilized in retail operations and wholesale services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in our results of operations in the period of change. Retail operations records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nGlossary\nAdditionally, as required by the authoritative guidance, we classify our derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of our derivative instruments incorporates various factors required under the guidance. These factors include:\n \u2022 the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit); \n \u2022 events specific to a given counterparty; and \n \u2022 the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities.  If there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions we use in pricing our derivative assets or liabilities, we may experience a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in Note 3 and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 and Item 1, Business\u201d herein.\nContingencies\nOur accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of activities that are incurred in the normal course of business and generally relate to contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future.\nActual results may differ from estimates and our estimates can be, and often are, revised depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Changes in our estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Our contingencies are further discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nPension and Welfare Plans\nOur pension and welfare plans costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and welfare plan costs and liabilities on an annual basis and update them when appropriate. The critical actuarial assumptions used to develop the required estimates for our pension and welfare plans include the following key factors:\n \u2022 expected return on plan assets; \n \u2022 the market value of plan assets; \n \u2022 assumed discount rates; \n \u2022 assumed mortality table; and \n \u2022 assumed health care costs.  The expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and welfare plans costs. We estimate the expected return on plans assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater or less than the assumed rate, it does not affect that year's annual pension or welfare plan cost; rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or welfare plan costs.\nEquity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported results. For the AGL Plan, market performance affects our market-related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five-year smoothing weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five-year smoothing weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense.\nIn addition, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) or the MRVPA for the AGL Plan. The excess, if any, is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed the method we use to estimate the net periodic benefit cost for our pension and welfare plans. Historically, we estimated the net periodic benefit costs by applying a single weighted-average discount rate derived from a yield curve of high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve, to the forecasted future cash flows in each year for each plan. We have elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve of high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve, to the forecasted future cash flows in each year for each plan. We have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of costs. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in the net periodic benefit costs is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported.\nGlossary\nWe have accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, have accounted for it prospectively starting in 2016. The reduction in net periodic benefit cost for 2016 associated with this change in estimate is approximately $7 million.\nDuring 2015, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $48 million (pre-capitalization) related to our defined pension and welfare benefit plans. We estimate that in 2016, we will record net periodic pension and welfare benefit costs in the range of $32 million to $36 million (pre-capitalization), a $16 million to $12 million decrease compared to 2015. In calculating our estimated expenses for 2016, our actuarial consultant assumed the following expected return on plan assets and discount rates:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Welfare plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate - service cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal and retirement rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants. The following table illustrates the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions for our pension and welfare plans while holding all other assumptions constant: Table 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage-point change in assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease) in PBO / APBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease) in cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+ / - 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>- / -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9) / 9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+ / - 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(157) / 193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14) / 15\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 5 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our pension and welfare plans.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nDeferred tax liabilities are estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.\nWith the sale of Tropical Shipping in the third quarter of 2014, we determined that the cumulative foreign earnings of that business would no longer be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Accordingly, we recognized income tax expense of $60 million in 2014 related to the cumulative foreign earnings for which no tax liabilities had been previously recorded, resulting from our repatriation of $86 million in cash.\nFor state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition, we operate within multiple tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure and, in our opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years reported.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our expectations of future taxable income and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis. We had a $19 million valuation allowance on $312 million of deferred tax assets ($249 million long-term and $63 million current) as of December 31, 2015, reflecting the expectation that a majority of these assets will be realized. Our gross long-term deferred tax liability totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2015. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our taxes.\nWe are required to determine whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on our tax return should be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertainty in income taxes only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nAdditionally, we recognize accrued interest related to uncertainty in income taxes in interest expense, and penalties in operating expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have a liability recorded for payment of interest and penalties associated with uncertainty in income taxes.\nGlossary\nAccounting Developments\nSee Accounting Developments\u201d in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nWe are an energy services holding company whose principal business is the safe, reliable and cost-effective distribution of natural gas in seven states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida, Tennessee and Maryland - through our seven natural gas distribution utilities. We are also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to our primary business. We have four reportable segments - distribution operations, retail operations, wholesale services and midstream operations - and one non-reportable segment - other. These segments are consistent with how management views and operates our business. Amounts shown in this Item 7, unless otherwise indicated, exclude discontinued operations. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information regarding discontinued operations. The following table shows the proportion of certain financial metrics attributable to our segments.\n\nBusiness Objectives Our priorities for 2016 are consistent with the direction we have taken the company over the last several years. We will remain focused on safe and efficient operations across all of our businesses, improving customer satisfaction and awareness of the benefits of our product and investment in infrastructure for the future. Several of our specific business objectives are detailed as follows:\n \u2022 Distribution Operations: Invest necessary capital to enhance and maintain safety and reliability in delivering natural gas; remain an efficiency leader within the industry while maintaining a focus on customer satisfaction; expand the natural gas distribution system and educate energy consumers on the benefits of converting to natural gas. We intend to continue investing in our regulatory infrastructure programs to minimize the lag in recovery of our capital. We continue to effectively manage costs and leverage our shared services model across our businesses to combat inflationary effects. \n \u2022 Retail Operations: Maintain our current customer base in Georgia and Illinois while continuing to expand into other profitable retail markets and expand our warranty businesses through partnership opportunities with affiliates and third parties. We will focus on products that are responsive to our customers' needs. \n \u2022 Wholesale Services: We continue to position our business to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility and third-party customers and to hedge natural gas prices to manage costs effectively, reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage relative to other marketers. \n \u2022 Midstream Operations: Invest in natural gas based projects, some of which remain subject to regulatory approvals, along with our existing pipelines and storage to support our efforts to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to our customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability and generate economic development in the areas served. For additional information on our pipeline projects, see Note 3 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein and Item 1, Business\u201d under the caption Midstream Operations.\u201d  Additionally, we intend to maintain our strong balance sheet and liquidity profile, solid investment grade ratings and our commitment to sustainable annual dividend growth. For additional information on our reportable segments, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein and Item 1, Business.\u201d\nPerformance and Non-GAAP Measures We evaluate segment performance using the measures of EBIT and operating margin. EBIT includes operating income and other income and expenses and excludes interest expense and income taxes, which we evaluate on a consolidated basis. Operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues minus cost of goods sold and revenue tax expense in distribution operations. Operating margin excludes operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, merger-related expenses, goodwill impairment charges and the gain or loss on the sale of our assets, which are included in our calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe believe that the presentation of operating margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of goods sold and revenue tax expenses can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to our customers. We further believe that operating margin at our retail operations, wholesale services and midstream operations segments allows us to focus on a direct measure of operating margin before overhead costs.\nGlossary\nWe present the non-GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share - as adjusted, which exclude merger-related expenses and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge at midstream operations. As we do not regularly engage in transactions of the magnitude of the proposed merger with Southern Company, and consequently do not regularly incur merger expenses of correlative size, we believe presenting diluted earnings per share excluding merger expenses provides investors with an additional measure of our core operating performance. We also have chosen to exclude a non-cash goodwill impairment related to our midstream operations segment because management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our core operating performance without this non-cash item.\nOperating margin and diluted earnings per share - as adjusted should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful indicators of, our operating performance than net income attributable to AGL Resources, operating income or diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our operating margin and diluted earnings per share - as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSummary of Results:\nThe table below reconciles (i) operating revenues and operating margin to operating income, (ii) EBIT to income before income taxes and net income and (iii) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share - as adjusted to GAAP diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations, together with other consolidated financial information for the last three years. \n (1) Our revenues declined significantly in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower natural gas prices and lower volumes of gas sold to customers due to weather in 2015 that was warmer than the extreme cold experienced in 2014. \n (2) Adjusted for Nicor Gas' revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to customers. \n (3) Operating expenses for 2015 include $44 million of merger-related expenses and a $14 million goodwill impairment charge. \n (4) In September 2014, we sold Tropical Shipping. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information.  2015 Results In 2015, our income from continuing operations attributable to AGL Resources decreased by $209 million, or 37%, compared to 2014. This decrease was due primarily to lower consolidated EBIT of $350 million, largely driven by wholesale services, and was partially offset by lower income tax expense of $137 million due to lower earnings in 2015.\nIncluded in the 2015 EBIT were $44 million of merger-related expenses and a $14 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge at our midstream operations segment. Excluding these items and the $314 million year-over-year change in results of wholesale services, EBIT increased by $22 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the following:\n \u2022 $34 million in additional operating margin at distribution operations from regulatory infrastructure programs, partially offset by $19 million in higher depreciation expense. \n \u2022 $19 million in additional operating margin at retail operations due to the recovery of prior year hedge losses and lower current year derivative losses resulting from changes in natural gas prices. \nGlossary\n \u2022 These increases were partially offset by weather at distribution operations and retail operations due to significantly warmer temperatures in 2015, compared to 2014.  Wholesale services reported $108 million of EBIT in 2015, compared to $422 million in 2014, a decrease of $314 million. In 2014, wholesale services benefited from increased natural gas volatility that was generated by significantly colder-than-normal weather through higher commercial activity and net hedge gains. Wholesale services continued to benefit from market volatility in 2015 and generated EBIT that was significantly higher than its average economic earnings expectation of $50 million.\n2014 Results In 2014, our income from continuing operations attributable to AGL Resources increased by $272 million, or 94%, compared to 2013. This increase was primarily the result of the following:\n \u2022 Significantly higher commercial activity primarily in the first quarter of 2014, and mark-to-market hedge gains, net of LOCOM adjustments at wholesale services in 2014 from price volatility generated by colder-than-normal weather, which increased operating margin by $462 million compared to 2013. \n \u2022 Increased operating margin at distribution operations and retail operations of $50 million mainly due to significantly colder-than-normal weather in 2014 as well as customer usage and customer growth. We also achieved growth as a result of our 2013 acquisitions and expansion into additional markets at retail operations. \n \u2022 These increases were partially offset by a decrease in margin of $10 million at midstream operations primarily due to a retained fuel true-up at one of our storage facilities from a reduction in the estimated cavern capacity as a result of naturally occurring shrinkage, as well as lower contracted firm rates at Jefferson Island and Central Valley. \n \u2022 Favorability year-over-year was negatively impacted by higher incentive compensation expenses primarily related to higher earnings in 2014 and increased outside services expenses of $49 million, and an $8 million higher pre-tax gain in 2013 related to the sale of Compass Energy. \n \u2022 Our income tax expense from continuing operations increased by $173 million for 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher consolidated earnings. The increase was primarily a result of increased earnings at wholesale services.  The variances for each reportable segment are contained within the year-over-year discussions on the following pages.\nProposed Merger With Southern Company In August 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Southern Company, which, based on the number of common shares and the fair value of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015, reflects an estimated business enterprise value of AGL Resources of $13.0 billion, including a total equity value of $7.9 billion. When the merger becomes effective, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2016, each share of our common stock, other than certain excluded shares, will convert into the right to receive $66 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the approval of certain state utility and other regulatory agencies. On November 19, 2015, the proposed merger was approved by our shareholders at a special meeting. At closing, the transaction is expected to create the second largest utility in the U.S. by customer base and we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company and continue to maintain our own management team. For additional information relating to this transaction, see Note 2 and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" herein for information on the merger-related risks.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues We generate the majority of our operating revenues through the sale, distribution and storage of natural gas. Our consolidated revenues include an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed, but not yet billed to our customers from the date of the last bill to the end of the reporting period. No individual customer or industry accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. The following table provides more information regarding the components of our operating revenues.\n\n (1) Includes significantly higher-than-normal revenues at wholesale services in 2014, which are not indicative of future performance.  Operating metrics Our operating metrics of weather impact, customer count, natural gas volumes and the seasonality of our operating results are presented below.\nWeather We measure weather and its effect on our business by using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for gas on our distribution systems. With the exception of Nicor Gas and Florida City Gas, we have regulatory mechanisms, such as weather normalization, which limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of our utilities' respective service areas. However, our utility customers in Illinois and our retail operations customers in Georgia can be impacted by warmer- or colder-than-normal weather. Additionally, we utilize weather hedges at distribution operations and retail operations to reduce negative earnings impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather, while retaining all of the earnings upside in the event of colder-than-normal weather for distribution operations in Illinois and most of the earnings upside for our retail operations. We also consider operating costs that may vary with the effects\nGlossary\nof weather, particularly in periods that are significantly colder-than-normal. The following table presents the Heating Degree Days information for those locations. \n (1) Normal represents the 10-year average from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2014, for Illinois at Chicago Midway International Airport and for Georgia at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, as obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center. \n (2) The 10-year average Heating Degree Days established by the Illinois Commission in our last rate case is 5,600 for the 12 months from 1998 through 2007.  In 2015, we experienced weather in Illinois that was 7% warmer-than-normal and 17% warmer than 2014. In the first quarter of 2015 weather in Illinois was 10% colder-than-normal, while weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 28% warmer-than-normal in Illinois. Since we hedged our Illinois weather risk for these quarterly periods separately and hedged only exposure for warmer-than-normal weather, the EBIT impact of weather for the year was favorable by $2 million, net of the impact of our weather hedging for distribution operations. The colder-than-normal weather in Illinois in 2014 primarily drove an EBIT increase of $22 million, for distribution operations, based on 10-year normal weather. For our retail operations in Georgia, weather in 2015 was 16% warmer-than-normal and 24% warmer than the same period last year. Similar to our strategy for distribution operations, because we hedged weather risk for our retail operations for the first and fourth quarters separately and hedged exposure for warmer-than-normal weather, the EBIT impact of weather for the year was slightly unfavorable by $1 million in 2015. The colder-than-normal weather increased EBIT by $8 million in 2014 compared to expected levels based on 10-year normal weather for our retail operations.\nCustomers The number of customers at distribution operations and energy customers at retail operations can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions and competition from alternative fuels. Our energy customers at retail operations are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois. Our customer metrics presented in the following table highlight the average number of customers to which we provided services for the specified periods.\n\n (1) In 2014, we implemented a process change at Nicor Gas that adversely impacted our customer count. This had the effect of immaterial growth for Nicor Gas compared to 2013. \n (2) The increase from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to the addition of approximately 33,000 residential and commercial customer relationships acquired in Illinois in June 2013. \n (3) Includes approximately 43,000 customer warranty contracts acquired in Connecticut and Massachusetts in the second half of 2015.  We anticipate overall customer growth trends at distribution operations for 2015 to continue in 2016 as we expect continued improvement in the economy, the related housing market and low natural gas prices. We use a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. These efforts include adding residential customers, multifamily complexes and commercial and industrial customers who use natural gas for purposes other than heating, as well as evaluating and launching new natural gas related programs, products and services to enhance customer growth, mitigate customer attrition and increase operating revenues. These programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. We also target customer conversions to natural gas from other energy sources, emphasizing the pricing advantage of natural gas. These programs focus on premises that could be connected to our distribution system at little or no cost to the customer. In cases where conversion cost can be a disincentive, we may employ rebate programs and other assistance to address customer cost issues.\nIn 2016, we intend to continue efforts in our retail operations segment to enter into targeted markets and expand energy customers and service contracts. We anticipate this expansion will provide growth opportunities in future years.\nGlossary\nVolume Our natural gas volume metrics for distribution operations and retail operations, as shown in the following table, illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas compared to the prior year. Wholesale services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to our customers. \nWithin midstream operations, our natural gas storage businesses seek to have a significant portion of their working natural gas capacity under firm subscription, but also take into account current and expected market conditions. This allows our natural gas storage business to generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, but retain some consistency with its earnings and maximize the value of its investments.\nOur midstream operations storage business is cyclical, and the abundant supply of natural gas in recent years and resulting lack of market and price volatility have negatively impacted the profitability of our storage facilities. The rates at which we may re-contract expiring capacity may not be as high as expected and may also remain below historical averages in 2016. The prices for natural gas storage capacity are expected to increase as supply and demand quantities reach equilibrium with continued economic improvement, expected exports of LNG, and projected demand increases in response to low prices and expanded uses for natural gas. The following table contains the overall monthly average firm subscription rates per facility and amount of firm capacity subscription for all periods presented. These amounts exclude 5 Bcf contracted by Sequent as of December 31, 2015, at an average monthly rate of $0.080 and 7 Bcf as of December 31, 2014, at an average monthly rate of $0.050.\n\nSeasonality of our Results During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to our distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain Consolidated Balance Sheets items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenue, inventories and short-term debt. However, these items are comparable when reviewing our annual results. Our base operating expenses, excluding cost of goods sold, interest expense, bad debt expense and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, our operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below. \nGlossary\nSegment Information\nThree years of operating margin, operating expenses and EBIT information for each of our segments is contained in the following table. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional segment information.\n\n (1) Operating margin is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of operating margin to operating revenues and operating income, and a reconciliation of EBIT to income before income taxes and net income is contained in Results of Operations\u201d herein. \n (2) Operating margin and operating expenses are adjusted for revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to our customers. \n (3) Operating expenses for 2015 include a $14 million goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter at midstream operations and $44 million of merger-related expenses recorded within our other segment. \n (4) EBIT for 2013 includes an $11 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Compass Energy in wholesale services and an $8 million pre-tax loss associated with the termination of the Sawgrass Storage project within midstream operations.  Distribution Operations Our distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the states we serve. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs, such as depreciation, interest, maintenance and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders.\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, our second largest utility, the earnings of our regulated utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas and general economic conditions that may impact our customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. We have various weather mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in their respective service areas. \nRetail Operations Our retail operations segment consists of several businesses that provide energy related products and services to retail markets. Retail operations is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts. In 2015, we recovered $15 million of prior period hedge losses and LOCOM adjustments as the underlying transactions were recognized at higher margins. The net effect is that the transactions ultimately resulted in the expected economic outcome at the time the derivatives were executed to manage the associated price risk.\nGlossary\n\nWholesale Services Our wholesale services segment is involved in asset management and optimization, storage, transportation, producer and peaking services, natural gas supply, natural gas services and wholesale marketing. We have positioned the business to generate positive economic earnings even under low volatility market conditions that can result from a number of factors, including weather fluctuations and changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the country. However, when market price volatility increases as we experienced in both 2015 and 2014, we are well positioned to capture significant value and generate stronger results. We principally use physical and financial arrangements to reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in market conditions and changing commodity prices. These economic hedges may not qualify, or are not designated for, hedge accounting treatment. As a result, our reported earnings for wholesale services reflect changes in the fair values of certain derivatives. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as gains or losses within our operating revenues.\n\nThe following table illustrates the components of wholesale services' operating margin for the periods presented.\n\nGlossary\nChange in commercial activity The commercial activity at wholesale services includes recognized storage and transportation values that were generated in prior periods, which reflect the impact of prior period hedge gains and losses as associated physical transactions occur in the period. Additionally, the commercial activity includes operating margin generated and recognized in the current period. The significant variances in commercial activity between 2015 and 2014 and between 2014 and 2013 are due largely to the recognition of significantly higher operating margin in 2014 associated with our transportation and storage portfolios, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions, from price volatility generated by the extreme and prolonged cold weather in that year. Additionally, 2015 operating margin was lower resulting from the withdrawal of storage inventory hedged at the end of 2014 relating to 2015 withdrawals that was included in the storage withdrawal schedule with a value of $(5) million as of December 31, 2014 compared to the comparable measure in 2014 of $28 million related to inventory hedged at the end of 2013. Operating margin in 2014 was also higher resulting from mark-to-market accounting derivative losses at the end of 2013. These mark-to-market losses were recovered in 2014 when the underlying related transactions were recognized at their higher values.\nChange in storage and transportation derivatives Continued price volatility in 2015 benefited wholesale services' portfolio of pipeline transportation and storage capacity assets throughout the U.S., primarily in the Northeast market. Although we do not expect this high level of price volatility to continue, we see the potential for market fundamentals indicating some level of increased volatility that would continue to benefit wholesale services should this occur. Storage derivative gains in 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to declines in natural gas prices applicable to the locations of our specific storage assets. These derivative gains were partially offset by LOCOM adjustments to natural gas inventories, net of estimated hedging recoveries.\nGains in our transportation and forward commodity derivative positions in 2015 are primarily due to the narrowing of transportation basis spreads associated with warmer-than-normal weather, which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points, primarily in the Northeast region. Gains in our transportation and forward commodity derivative positions in 2014 are primarily the result of narrowing transportation basis spreads. Transportation and forward commodity hedge losses in 2013 were the result of widening transportation basis spreads, and were largely recovered in 2014 with the physical flow of natural gas and utilization of the contracted transportation capacity.\nWe account for natural gas stored in inventory differently than the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio. The natural gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas daily or spot prices at the end of the year. The derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period using forward natural gas prices. This difference in accounting treatment can result in volatility in wholesale services' reported results, even though the expected net operating revenue and expected economic value are substantially unchanged since the date the transactions were initiated. These accounting timing differences also affect the comparability of wholesale services' period-over-period results, since changes in forward NYMEX prices do not increase and decrease on a consistent basis from year to year. Largely as a result of moderate weather in the fourth quarters of both 2015 and 2014 leading to significant decreases in natural gas prices, wholesale services recorded LOCOM adjustments of $19 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFor our natural gas transportation portfolio, we enter into transportation capacity contracts with interstate and intrastate pipelines for the delivery of natural gas between receipt and delivery points in future periods. We purchase natural gas for transportation when the market price we pay for gas at a receipt point plus the cost of transportation capacity required to deliver the gas to the delivery point is less than the sales price at the delivery point. The difference between the prices at the receipt and delivery points is the transportation basis or location spread. Similar to our storage transactions, we attempt to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our transportation portfolio by using derivative instruments to reduce the risk associated with future changes in the price of natural gas at the receipt and delivery points. We utilize futures contracts or OTC derivatives to hedge both the commodity price risk relative to the market price at the receipt point and the market price at the delivery point to substantially protect the operating revenue that we will ultimately realize once the natural gas is received, delivered and sold.\nVolatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on our customer rates, our long-term competitive position against other energy sources and the ability of our wholesale services segment to capture value from location and seasonal spreads. During both the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, we experienced increased price volatility brought on largely by colder weather and supply constraints in the Northeast and Midwest regions, which enabled us to capture value under these market conditions. Commercial activity in 2014 was particularly favorable due to significant natural gas price volatility, largely the result of significantly colder-than-normal weather primarily in the first quarter.\nWhile market conditions in 2014 and early 2015 experienced more natural gas price volatility, in the near term, we anticipate low volatility in certain areas of our portfolio, but expect a continuation of some volatility in the supply-constrained Northeast corridor. Over the longer term, we expect volatility to be low to moderate and locational or transportation spreads to decrease over time as new pipelines are built to reduce the bottleneck in the currently constrained shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these pipelines are delayed or not built, volatility could increase. While natural gas supply increased during the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 Heating Seasons in the U.S., it was not enough to meet the increased demand, resulting in storage levels that were lower than historical periods. The warm 2015 winter weather experienced in the U.S. resulted in record natural gas inventories that contributed to reduced natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment,\nGlossary\nincluding the significant drop in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers and reduced levels of natural gas production. Further, if economic conditions continue to improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.\nThe expected natural gas withdrawals from storage, including the expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with our transportation portfolio at December 31, 2015 are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal from storage and the physical flow of natural gas between contracted transportation receipt and delivery points. Our expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, and other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt and delivery charges, but are net of the estimated impact of profit sharing under our asset management agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2015. A portion of wholesale services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues, timing notwithstanding. The timing of future withdrawals may change in response to changes in future economic value or other factors.\n\n (1) Represents expected operating gains from planned storage withdrawals associated with existing inventory positions and could change as wholesale services adjusts its daily injection and withdrawal plans in response to changes in future market conditions and forward NYMEX price fluctuations. \n (2) Represents the periods associated with the transportation derivative (gains) losses during which the derivatives will be settled and the physical transportation transactions will occur that offset the derivative (gains) losses recognized in 2014 and 2015.  The unrealized storage and transportation derivative gains do not change the underlying economic value of our storage and transportation positions and, based on current expectations, will primarily be reversed in 2016 when the related transactions occur and are recognized. For more information on wholesale services' energy marketing and risk management activities, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption Weather and Natural Gas Price Risks.\u201d For a discussion of commercial activity, see Item 1, Business\u201d under the caption Wholesale Services.\u201d\nMidstream Operations Our midstream operations segment's primary activity is operating non-utility storage and pipeline facilities, including the development and operation of high-deliverability underground natural gas storage and pipeline assets. While this business can also generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, certain of our storage services are covered under short-, medium- and long-term contracts at fixed market rates. During 2015, midstream operations' EBIT was negatively impacted by a $14 million non-cash goodwill impairment that was recorded in the third quarter. \nOther Our \"other\" segment includes our investment in Triton, AGL Services Company and AGL Capital as well as various corporate operating expenses that we do not allocate to our reportable segments. During 2015, such operating expenses included $44 million of merger-related transaction costs, $8 million for the deductible related to insured losses and $3 million of accelerated expenses related to the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer.\nGlossary\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview The acquisition of natural gas and pipeline capacity, payment of dividends and funding of working capital needs primarily related to our natural gas inventory are our most significant short-term financing requirements. The liquidity required to fund these short-term needs is generally provided by our operating activities, and any needs not met are primarily satisfied with short-term borrowings under our commercial paper programs, which are supported by the AGL Credit Facility and the Nicor Gas Credit Facility. For more information on the seasonality of our short-term borrowings, see Short-term Debt\u201d later in this section. The need for long-term capital is driven primarily by capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt. Periodically, we raise funds supporting our long-term cash needs from the issuance of long-term debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs in a cost-effective manner.\nOur financing activities, including long-term and short-term debt and equity, are subject to customary approval or review by the state agencies in which we conduct business as well as the FERC. A substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flows is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us may be subject to regulation. By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. Additionally, Elizabethtown Gas is restricted by their dividend policy as established by the New Jersey BPU in the amount it can dividend to AGL Resources to the extent of 70% of its quarterly net income.\nWe believe the amounts available to us under our long-term debt and credit facilities as well as through the issuance of additional debt, combined with cash provided by operating activities will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, anticipated debt redemptions, interest payments on debt obligations, dividend payments and other cash needs through the next several years.\nThe ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and our debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, substantially depends upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which we are unable to control. These factors include, among others, regulatory changes, the price of and demand for natural gas, and operational risks.\nOur capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of debt and equity securities. This strategy includes active management of the percentage of total debt relative to total capitalization, as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities and maintenance of an appropriate mix of debt with fixed and floating interest rates. Our variable debt target is 20% to 45% of total debt. As of December 31, 2015, our variable-rate debt was $1.3 billion, or 28%, of our total debt, compared to $1.5 billion, or 31%, as of December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to reduced commercial paper borrowings resulting from warmer weather that resulted in lower natural gas sales as well as the lower cost of gas in 2015. For more information on our debt, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nOn November 18, 2015, AGL Capital issued $250 million in 10-year senior notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. The net proceeds from the senior notes of $248 million, which are guaranteed by AGL Capital, were used to repay a portion of AGL Capital's commercial paper, including $200 million we borrowed to repay senior notes that matured on January 15, 2015.\nIn January 2015, we executed $800 million in notional value of 10 year and 30 year fixed-rate forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge potential interest rate volatility prior to the anticipated issuances of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in 2016. We designated the forward-starting interest rate swaps, which mature on the respective debt issuance dates, as cash flow hedges. We settled $200 million of these interest rate swaps on November 18, 2015, in conjunction with the aforementioned senior note issuance. The remaining $600 million of interest rate swaps, which had a fair value of $9 million as of December 31, 2015, are expected to be settled in 2016. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption Interest Rate Risk\u201d for additional information.\nOur objective remains to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile, solid investment grade ratings and annual dividend growth. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate our need to increase available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements, including the impact of changes in natural gas prices, liquidity requirements established by rating agencies, acquisitions and other factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for additional information on items that could impact our liquidity and capital resource requirements.\nShort-term Debt The following table provides additional information on our short-term debt throughout the year.\n\n (1) As of December 31, 2015. \n (2) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. \nGlossary\nThe largest, minimum and daily average balances borrowed under our commercial paper programs are important when assessing the intra-period fluctuations of our short-term borrowings and potential liquidity risk. The fluctuations are due to our seasonal cash requirements to fund working capital needs, in particular the purchase of natural gas inventory, margin calls and collateral posting requirements. The largest and minimum balances outstanding for each debt instrument occurred at different times during the period. Consequently, the total balances are not indicative of actual borrowings on any one day during the period. Cash requirements generally increase between June and December as we purchase natural gas in advance of the Heating Season. The timing differences between payment to our suppliers for natural gas purchases and recovery of costs from our customers through their monthly bills can significantly affect our cash requirements. Our short-term debt balances are typically reduced during the Heating Season, as a significant portion of our current assets, primarily natural gas inventories, are converted into cash.\nOur commercial paper borrowings are supported by the $1.3 billion AGL Credit Facility and $700 million Nicor Gas Credit Facility, which can be drawn upon to meet working capital and other general corporate needs. However, the Nicor Gas Credit Facility can only be used for the working capital needs of Nicor Gas. The interest rates payable on borrowings under these facilities are calculated at either the alternative base rate plus an applicable interest margin or LIBOR plus an applicable interest margin. The applicable interest margin used in both interest rate calculations will vary according to AGL Capital's and Nicor Gas' current credit ratings. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under either credit facility.\nThe timing of natural gas withdrawals is dependent on the weather and natural gas market conditions, both of which impact the price of natural gas. Increasing natural gas commodity prices can significantly impact our commercial paper borrowings. Based on our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015, and our maximum 70% debt to total capitalization allowed under our financial covenants, we could borrow an additional $798 million of commercial paper under the AGL Credit Facility and an additional $162 million of commercial paper under the Nicor Gas Credit Facility. As a result, based on current natural gas prices and our expected injection plan, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover our working capital needs.\nIn October 2015, we entered into agreements to amend and extend our credit facilities. Under the terms of these agreements, we extended the maturity dates of the AGL Credit Facility and Nicor Gas Credit Facility to November 9, 2018 and December 14, 2018, respectively. One of the banks elected not to participate in this extension and its total commitment of $75 million will continue through the fourth quarter of 2017. We also modified the credit facilities to provide for the limited consent by the lenders to the proposed merger with Southern Company. Additionally, we made similar changes to our Bank Rate Mode Covenants Agreement.\nThe lenders under our credit facilities and lines of credit are major financial institutions with $2.2 billion of committed balances and all had investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2015. It is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if a lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency. However, based on our current assessment of our lenders' creditworthiness, we believe the risk of lender default is minimal. Commercial paper borrowings reduce availability of these credit facilities.\nLong-term Debt Our long-term debt matures more than one year from December 31, 2015 and consists of medium-term notes; Series A, Series B, and Series C, which we issued under an indenture dated December 1989; senior notes; first mortgage bonds and gas facility revenue bonds. Our long-term cash requirements primarily depend upon our level of capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities and decisions to refinance long-term debt. The following table summarizes our long-term debt issuances and refinancings over the last three years. \n (1) The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of AGL Capital's commercial paper, including $200 million we borrowed to repay senior notes that matured on January 15, 2015. \n (2) The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of AGL Capital's commercial paper, including $225 million we borrowed to repay senior notes that matured on April 15, 2013. \n (3) There were no cash receipts or payments in connection with the refinancing of these gas facility revenue bonds.  Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and our ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing are directly impacted by our credit ratings, as well as the availability of financial markets. Credit ratings are important to our counterparties when we engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. It is our long-term objective to maintain or improve our credit ratings in order to manage our existing financing costs and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and may periodically change. The rating agencies regularly review our performance and financial condition and reevaluate their ratings of our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, our corporate ratings and our ratings outlook. There is no guarantee that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of other ratings.\nGlossary\nFactors we consider important to assessing our credit ratings include our Consolidated Balance Sheets, leverage, capital spending, earnings, cash flow generation, available liquidity and overall business risks. We do not have any triggering events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any agreements that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. A downgrade in our current ratings, particularly below investment grade, would increase our borrowing costs and could limit our access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. As of December 31, 2015, if our credit rating had fallen below investment grade, we would have been required to provide collateral of $19 million to continue conducting business with certain customers.\nThe table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2015.\n\n (1) During the third quarter of 2015, S&P revised both AGL Resources' and Nicor Gas' ratings outlooks to positive from stable and Fitch revised AGL Resources' outlook to positive. \n (2) Credit ratings are for AGL Capital, whose obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by AGL Resources. \n (3) Moody's downgraded AGL Capital's senior unsecured rating to Baa1 from A3 during the third quarter of 2015.  Default Provisions As indicated below, our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment or similar actions.\n \u2022 Our credit facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to the failure to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness and a change of control; \n \u2022 Our credit facilities contain certain non-financial covenants that, among other things, restrict liens and encumbrances, loans and investments, acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, asset dispositions, mergers and consolidations, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements; and \n \u2022 Our credit facilities each include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 70% at the end of any fiscal month. However, we typically seek to maintain these ratios at levels between 50% and 60%, except for temporary increases related to the timing of acquisition and financing activities.  We were in compliance with all of our debt provisions and covenants, both financial and non-financial, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. For additional information on our default provisions, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nCash Flows\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows using the indirect method, under which we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, changes in derivative instrument assets and liabilities, deferred income taxes, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses on the sale of assets and changes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for working capital during the period. The following table provides a summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows for the last three years.\n\n (1) Amounts for 2014 and 2013 include activity for discontinued operations. \nGlossary\nCash Flow from Operating Activities 2015 compared to 2014 Our net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2015 was $1.4 billion, an increase of $726 million, or 111%, from 2014. The increase was primarily related to (i) higher working capital needs during the prior year that was driven by higher natural gas prices and volumes delivered as well as the timing of recoveries of related gas costs from customers, (ii) cash provided by derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities primarily as a result of the decrease in forward NYMEX prices year-over-year and (iii) a 2014 tax refund of $150 million received in January 2015 related to the prior year extension of bonus depreciation late in 2014 (the 2015 tax refund related to the extension of bonus depreciation in late 2015 is expected in early 2016). These increases were partially offset by (i) lower earnings year-over-year largely attributable to warmer weather than experienced in 2014, and (ii) energy marketing receivables and payables, due to less cash received in 2015 from the prior year.\n2014 compared to 2013 Our net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2014 was $655 million, a decrease of $316 million or 33% from 2013. The decrease was primarily related to (i) income taxes, largely driven by the utilization of a prior period net operating loss that reduced the 2013 tax obligation combined with taxes paid in 2014 due to increased earnings and the repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings of Tropical Shipping, (ii) increased cash for inventory and (iii) trade payables, other than energy marketing, due to higher accrued volumes in December 2013 compared to December 2012. These decreases were partially offset by increases primarily related to (i) higher earnings year over year largely attributed to significantly colder-than-normal weather in 2014 and increased price volatility that enabled us to capture value in wholesale services and (ii) net energy marketing receivables and payables, due to higher cash received in 2014 from the prior year.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities Our net cash flow used in investing activities in 2015 increased $522 million, or 103%, from 2014, primarily as a result of increased infrastructure investment, primarily relating to Nicor Gas' Investing in Illinois program, combined with increased spending for other rate-based investments at distribution operations. Additionally, the variance was driven by the $225 million proceeds from the sale of Tropical Shipping during the third quarter of 2014. Our estimated PP&E expenditures for 2016 and our actual PP&E expenditures incurred in 2015, 2014 and 2013 are presented in the following table.\n\n (1) Includes Investing in Illinois at Nicor Gas, STRIDE at Atlanta Gas Light, SAVE at Virginia Natural Gas, AIR at Elizabethtown Gas and SAFE at Florida City Gas.  The 2015 increase in PP&E expenditures of $258 million, or 34%, was due to increased spending of $281 million related to infrastructure improvements on our Investing in Illinois program. This was partially offset by decreased spending related to our new construction projects.\nOur PP&E expenditures were $769 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $731 million for the same period in 2013. The increase of $38 million or 5% was due to increased spending of $84 million primarily related to new construction and infrastructure improvements at our utilities. This was partially offset by a $46 million net decrease in expenditures for our regulatory infrastructure programs largely due to PRP at Atlanta Gas Light, which ended in 2013, offset by increased spending on our other regulatory infrastructure programs that primarily included $57 million at Atlanta Gas Light for i-VPR, $24 million at Elizabethtown Gas for AIR and $22 million at Nicor Gas for Investing in Illinois.\nOur estimated expenditures for 2016 include discretionary spending for capital projects principally within the distribution business, regulatory infrastructure programs, natural gas storage and other categories. We continuously evaluate whether or not to proceed with these projects, reviewing them in relation to various factors, including our authorized returns on rate base, other returns on invested capital for projects of a similar nature, capital structure and credit ratings, among others. We make adjustments to our discretionary expenditures as necessary based upon these factors.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities Our net cash flow used in financing activities in 2015 increased $142 million, or 63%, from 2014 primarily as a result of the net repayments of our commercial paper during 2015, partially offset by the excess of proceeds from our issuance of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 over the senior notes that matured in the first quarter of 2015. For more information on our financing activities, see \"Short-term Debt\" and \"Long-term Debt\" within Item 7 under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nNoncontrolling Interest We recorded cash distributions for SouthStar's dividends to Piedmont of $18 million in 2015, $17 million in 2014 and $17 million in 2013 as financing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nDividends on Common Stock Our common stock dividend payments were $244 million in 2015, $233 million in 2014 and $222 million in 2013. The increases were primarily due to the annual dividend increase of $0.08 per share in each of 2015 and 2014.\nGlossary\nOff-balance sheet arrangements We have certain guarantees, as further described in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. We believe the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. We also have authorized unrecognized ratemaking amounts, primarily composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain of our regulatory infrastructure programs, which are not reflected within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of business that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue-producing activities. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. The following table illustrates our expected future contractual obligation payments and commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2015.\n\n (1) Includes charges recoverable through base rates or rate rider mechanisms. \n (2) In accordance with GAAP, these items are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n (3) Includes charges recoverable through a natural gas cost recovery mechanism or alternatively billed to marketers and demand charges associated with Sequent. The gas supply balance includes amounts for Nicor Gas and SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 37 Bcf at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2015, and is valued at $76 million. As we do for certain of our affiliates, we provide guarantees to certain gas suppliers for SouthStar in support of payment obligations. \n (4) Floating rate interest charges are calculated based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2015 and the maturity date of the underlying debt instrument. As of December 31, 2015, we have $49 million of accrued interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets that will be paid in 2016. \n (5) We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with GAAP. However, this lease accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein. Our operating leases are primarily for real estate. \n (6) Represent fixed-fee minimum payments for Sequent's affiliated asset management agreements. \n (7) We provide guarantees to certain municipalities and other agencies and certain gas suppliers of SouthStar in support of payment obligations.  Standby letters of credit and performance/surety bonds. We also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. We would expect to fund these contingent financial commitments with operating and financing cash flows.\nPension and welfare obligations. Generally, our pension plan funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Pension Protection Act. We calculate any required pension contributions using the traditional unit credit cost method; however, additional voluntary contributions are periodically made. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. The contributions represent the portion of the welfare costs for which we are responsible under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory agencies.\nThe state regulatory agencies in all of our jurisdictions, except Illinois, have phase-ins that defer a portion of the retirement benefit expenses for retirement plans other than pensions for future recovery. We recorded a regulatory asset for these future recoveries of $125 million as of December 31, 2015 and $122 million as of December 31, 2014. In Illinois, all accrued retirement plan expenses are recovered through base rates. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information about our pension and welfare plans.\nGlossary\nIn both 2015 and 2014, no contributions were required to our qualified pension plan. Based on the estimated funded status of the AGL Plan, we do not expect any required contribution to the plan in 2016. We may, at times, elect to contribute additional amounts to the AGL Plan in accordance with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Those judgments and estimates have a significant effect on our financial statements, primarily due to the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We frequently reevaluate our judgments and estimates that are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which represent those that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty, judgment and complexity. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nAccounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries\nAt December 31, 2015, our regulatory assets were $738 million and regulatory liabilities were $1.7 billion. At December 31, 2014, our regulatory assets were $714 million and regulatory liabilities were $1.7 billion. Our natural gas distribution operations and certain regulated transmission and storage operations meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity under GAAP. Accordingly, the financial results of these operations reflect the effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject.\nAs a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under GAAP are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable that they can be recovered through rates. The periods in which revenues or expenses are recognized are impacted by regulation. In instances where other GAAP accounting treatment supersedes Accounting Standards Codification 980 - Regulated Operations, we apply the other GAAP accounting treatment. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations.\nDiscontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses, as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Assets and liabilities recognized as a result of rate regulation would be written off in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred. A write-off of all our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2015 would result in 5% and 16% decreases in total assets and total liabilities, respectively. For more information on our regulated assets and liabilities, see Note 3 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets\nGoodwill We do not amortize our goodwill, but test it annually for impairment at the reporting unit level during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.\nAs part of our impairment test, an initial qualitative step 0 assessment is made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events and events specific to each reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nStep 1 of the two-step goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the result of our step 1 test reveals that the estimated fair value is below its carrying value we proceed with step 2.\nStep 2 of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill, which is calculated as the residual amount from the reporting unit's overall fair value after assigning fair values to its assets and liabilities under a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination, to its carrying value. Based on the result of the step 2 test, we record a goodwill impairment charge for any excess of carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill.\nWhile preparing our third quarter 2015 financial statements, and in connection with our 2016 annual budget process, we assessed various market factors and projections prepared by both internal and external sources related to subscription rates for contracting capacity at our storage facilities as well as the profitability of our storage and fuels reporting unit. Based on this assessment, we concluded that a decline in projected storage subscription rates as well as a reduction in the near-term projection of the reporting unit's profitability required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015.\nThe two-step goodwill impairment test for our storage and fuels reporting unit within the midstream operations segment resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of the full $14 million ($9 million, net of tax) of goodwill.\nGlossary\nFor our 2015 annual impairment test for all other reporting units, we performed the qualitative step 0 assessment described above and determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was required. The amounts of goodwill as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are provided below. \nLong-Lived Assets We depreciate or amortize our long-lived and intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Currently, we have no significant indefinite-lived intangible assets. We assess our long-lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. Impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.\nOur agreement in June 2013 to acquire customer relationship intangible assets within our retail operations segment included a provision for the seller to provide an adjustment to the $32 million purchase price for attrition that exceeds historical levels. As a result of this provision, the seller paid us $5 million in January 2015, which is reflected as a reduction to our intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 and reduced the amortization for the same amount over the remaining useful life of 13.5 years.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe authoritative guidance to determine whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is voluminous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in our assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.\nThe authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging requires that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. However, if the derivative transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or normal sale, it is exempted from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.\nThe authoritative accounting guidance requires that changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, the guidance allows derivative gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the case of a fair value hedge, or to record the gains and losses in OCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the hedged transaction occurs in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, the guidance requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.\nNicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas utilize derivative instruments to hedge the price risk for the purchase of natural gas for customers. These derivatives are reflected at fair value and are not designated as accounting hedges. Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed through directly to customers, subject to review by the applicable state regulatory agencies, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nWe use derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to our results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas and to a lesser extent we hedge against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage our exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For the derivatives utilized in retail operations and wholesale services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in our results of operations in the period of change. Retail operations records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nGlossary\nAdditionally, as required by the authoritative guidance, we classify our derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of our derivative instruments incorporates various factors required under the guidance. These factors include:\n \u2022 the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit); \n \u2022 events specific to a given counterparty; and \n \u2022 the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities.  If there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions we use in pricing our derivative assets or liabilities, we may experience a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in Note 3 and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 and Item 1, Business\u201d herein.\nContingencies\nOur accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of activities that are incurred in the normal course of business and generally relate to contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future.\nActual results may differ from estimates and our estimates can be, and often are, revised depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Changes in our estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Our contingencies are further discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nPension and Welfare Plans\nOur pension and welfare plans costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and welfare plan costs and liabilities on an annual basis and update them when appropriate. The critical actuarial assumptions used to develop the required estimates for our pension and welfare plans include the following key factors:\n \u2022 expected return on plan assets; \n \u2022 the market value of plan assets; \n \u2022 assumed discount rates; \n \u2022 assumed mortality table; and \n \u2022 assumed health care costs.  The expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and welfare plans costs. We estimate the expected return on plans assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater or less than the assumed rate, it does not affect that year's annual pension or welfare plan cost; rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or welfare plan costs.\nEquity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported results. For the AGL Plan, market performance affects our market-related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five-year smoothing weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five-year smoothing weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense.\nIn addition, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) or the MRVPA for the AGL Plan. The excess, if any, is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed the method we use to estimate the net periodic benefit cost for our pension and welfare plans. Historically, we estimated the net periodic benefit costs by applying a single weighted-average discount rate derived from a yield curve of high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve, to the forecasted future cash flows in each year for each plan. We have elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve of high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield curve, to the forecasted future cash flows in each year for each plan. We have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of costs. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in the net periodic benefit costs is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported.\nGlossary\nWe have accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, have accounted for it prospectively starting in 2016. The reduction in net periodic benefit cost for 2016 associated with this change in estimate is approximately $7 million.\nDuring 2015, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $48 million (pre-capitalization) related to our defined pension and welfare benefit plans. We estimate that in 2016, we will record net periodic pension and welfare benefit costs in the range of $32 million to $36 million (pre-capitalization), a $16 million to $12 million decrease compared to 2015. In calculating our estimated expenses for 2016, our actuarial consultant assumed the following expected return on plan assets and discount rates:\n\nThe actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal and retirement rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants. The following table illustrates the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions for our pension and welfare plans while holding all other assumptions constant: \nSee Note 5 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our pension and welfare plans.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nDeferred tax liabilities are estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.\nWith the sale of Tropical Shipping in the third quarter of 2014, we determined that the cumulative foreign earnings of that business would no longer be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Accordingly, we recognized income tax expense of $60 million in 2014 related to the cumulative foreign earnings for which no tax liabilities had been previously recorded, resulting from our repatriation of $86 million in cash.\nFor state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition, we operate within multiple tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure and, in our opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years reported.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our expectations of future taxable income and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis. We had a $19 million valuation allowance on $312 million of deferred tax assets ($249 million long-term and $63 million current) as of December 31, 2015, reflecting the expectation that a majority of these assets will be realized. Our gross long-term deferred tax liability totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2015. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our taxes.\nWe are required to determine whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on our tax return should be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertainty in income taxes only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nAdditionally, we recognize accrued interest related to uncertainty in income taxes in interest expense, and penalties in operating expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have a liability recorded for payment of interest and penalties associated with uncertainty in income taxes.\nGlossary\nAccounting Developments\nSee Accounting

points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- AGL Resources is an energy services holding company operating regulated natural gas utilities and other complementary businesses. It has four reportable segments.\n- In August 2015, AGL Resources entered into an agreement to be acquired by Southern Company in a transaction that values AGL at $13 billion. The merger is expected to close in the second half of 2016.\n\n2015 Performance\n- Income from continuing operations attributable to AGL declined 37% compared to 2014, largely due to lower earnings at the wholesale services segment. 2015 results also included $44 million in merger-related expenses.\n\nSegments\n- Distribution operations earnings were flat as higher revenues from infrastructure programs were offset by increased operating costs. \n- Retail operations earnings increased due to the recovery of prior hedge losses.\n- Wholesale services earnings decreased significantly compared to 2014 when results benefited from high natural gas price volatility. But 2015 earnings still exceeded typical expectations.\n- Midstream operations recorded a $14 million goodwill impairment charge.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- AGL has adequate sources of liquidity and issued $250 million in 10-year senior notes in November 2015. \n- Capital expenditures increased over 30% in 2015 driven by infrastructure investment programs. Higher spending is expected again in 2016.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Key policies include accounting for rate-regulated subsidiaries, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment testing, derivatives and hedging, contingencies, pensions and income taxes.\n\nSo in summary, AGL Resources experienced lower earnings in 2015 but maintains a solid financial position and liquidity. The pending merger with Southern Company is a key focus."}
