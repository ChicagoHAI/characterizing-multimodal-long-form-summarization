Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOUTFRONT Media is a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d), which provides advertising space ( displays\u201d) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the U.S.\u201d) and Canada. We manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other (see Item 8., Note 19. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America.\nOn April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the Disposition\u201d), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America. (See Item 8., Note 13. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included on our Consolidated Financial Statements for 2016, and are included in Other in our segment reporting.\nBusiness\nWe are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas ( DMAs\u201d), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. and Canada. We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and approximately 140 markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser's website or retail location one mile down the road.\u201d\nIn addition to providing location-based displays, we also focus on delivering audiences to our customers. Using Geopath, the out-of-home advertising industry's audience measurement system, we provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays or a complete campaign. As part of our ON Smart Media platform, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. Additionally, our OUTFRONT Mobile Network allows our customers to further leverage location targeting with interactive mobile advertising that uses geofence technology and other data to push mobile ads to consumers within a pre-defined radius around a corresponding billboard display or other designated advertising location. Further, our social influence add-on product allows our customers to leverage location targeting with social sharing amplification.\nWe believe out-of-home advertising continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective stand-alone\u201d medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio, print, online, mobile and social media advertising platforms. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, attribution, consumer insights, creative design support through OUTFRONT Studios, print production and post-campaign tracking and analytics, as well as use of a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for substantially all of our business.\nU.S. Media. Our U.S. Media segment generated 22% of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in 2018, 23% in 2017 and 25% in 2016, and generated 16% in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our U.S. Media segment generated Revenues of $1,466.8 million in 2018, $1,406.5 million in 2017 and $1,393.8 million in 2016, and Operating income before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Impairment charges and Loss on real estate assets held for sale ( Adjusted OIBDA\u201d) of $500.2 million in 2018, $478.1 million in 2017 and $473.8 million in 2016. (See the Segment Results of Operations\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nOther (includes International and Sports Marketing). Other generated Revenues of $139.4 million in 2018, $114.0 million in 2017 and $120.1 million in 2016, and Adjusted OIBDA of $17.3 million in 2018, $8.4 million in 2017 and $17.8 million in 2016.\nEconomic Environment\nOur revenues and operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in advertising expenditures, general economic conditions and other external events beyond our control.\nBusiness Environment\nThe outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several companies operating on a national basis, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for both customers and structure and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional advertising platforms (such as television, radio, print and direct mail marketers). In addition, we compete with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters supermarkets and taxis.\nIncreasing the number of digital displays in our prime audience locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce print production and installation costs. In addition, digital displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display. Digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays. Digital billboard displays also incur, on average, approximately two to four times more costs, including higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue than traditional static billboard displays. As a result, digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays. The majority of our digital billboard displays were converted from traditional static billboard displays.\nIn 2017, we commenced deployment of state-of-the-art digital transit displays in connection with several transit franchises and are planning to increase deployments significantly over the coming years. Once the digital transit displays have been deployed at scale, we expect that revenue generated on digital transit displays will be a multiple of the revenue generated on comparable static transit displays. We intend to incur significant equipment deployment costs and capital expenditures in the coming years to continue increasing the number of digital displays in our portfolio.\nWe have built or converted 57 new digital billboard displays in the United States and 26 in Canada in 2018. Additionally, in 2018, we installed 56 small-format digital displays and entered into marketing arrangements to sell advertising on 18 third-party digital billboard displays in the U.S. with a net decrease of three third-party digital billboard displays in Canada. In 2018, we have built, converted or replaced 1,646 digital transit and other displays in the United States. The following table sets forth information regarding our digital displays.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Revenues (in millions)\nfor the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Digital Displays\nas of December 31, 2018(a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Billboard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Transit and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Digital Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Billboard Displays\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Transit and Other Displays\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Digital Displays\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Digital display amounts (1) include displays reserved for transit agency use and (2) exclude: (i) all displays under our multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions; and (ii) 1,649 MetroCard vending machine digital screens.

Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season.\nWe have a diversified base of customers across various industries. During 2018, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, computers/internet and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 8%, and 8% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2017, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, healthcare/pharmaceuticals and television, which represented 9%, 8% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues. During 2016, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 7% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively.\nOur large-scale portfolio allows our customers to reach a national audience and also provides the flexibility to tailor campaigns to specific regions or markets. In 2018, we generated approximately 44% of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns, compared to 45% in 2017 and 47% in 2016.\nOur transit businesses require us to periodically obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain or renew contracts.\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on the indicators described below.\nSeveral of our key performance indicators are not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,606.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,520.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenues(a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,586.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,513.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>479.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA(b) margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations ( FFO\u201d)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted FFO ( AFFO\u201d)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with a significant acquisition, the impact of a new accounting standard (See Item 8., Note 2.

We provide organic revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of non-organic revenue items. Our management believes organic revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since organic revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Organic revenues, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d and Revenues\u201d sections of this MD&A for reconciliations of Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, Net income to FFO and AFFO and Revenues to organic revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted OIBDA\nWe calculate Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, net (gain) loss on dispositions, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and loss on real estate assets held for sale. We calculate Adjusted OIBDA margin by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are among the primary measures we use for managing our business, evaluating our operating performance and planning and forecasting future periods, as each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because eliminating certain non-comparable items highlight operational trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier for users of our financial data to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.\nFFO and AFFO\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO reflects net income (loss) adjusted to exclude gains and losses from the sale of real estate assets, impairment charges, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, amortization of direct lease acquisition costs and the same adjustments for our equity-based investments, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We calculate AFFO as FFO adjusted to include cash paid for direct lease acquisition costs as such costs are generally amortized over a period ranging from four weeks to one year and therefore are incurred on a regular basis. AFFO also includes cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures since these are routine uses of cash that are necessary for our operations. In addition, AFFO excludes costs related to restructuring charges, as well as certain non-cash items, including non-real estate depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, accretion expense, the non-cash effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred financing costs, and the non-cash portion of income taxes, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We use FFO and AFFO measures for managing our business and for planning and forecasting future periods, and each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance, especially compared to other REITs. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of FFO and AFFO, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because adjusting results to reflect items that have more bearing on the operating performance of REITs highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our\nfinancial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier to compare our results to other companies in our industry, as well as to REITs.\nSince Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin, FFO and AFFO are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, these measures do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, and Net income to FFO and AFFO.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

AFFO in 2018 of $299.7 million increased $22.1 million, or 8%, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items and lower maintenance capital expenditures, partially offset by lower restructuring charges.\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive Revenues primarily from providing advertising space to customers on our advertising structures and sites. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year.

These expenses reflect the cost of leasing the real property on which our billboards are mounted. These lease agreements have terms varying between one month and multiple years, and usually provide renewal options. Rental expenses are comprised of a fixed monthly amount and under certain agreements, also include contingent rent, which varies based on the revenues we generate from the leased site. The fixed portion of property leases are generally paid in advance for periods ranging from one to twelve months and expensed evenly over the contract term. Contingent rent is generally paid in arrears and is expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized.\nTransit franchise expenses. These expenses reflect costs charged by municipalities and transit operators under transit advertising contracts and are generally calculated based on a percentage of the revenues we generate under the contract, with a minimum guarantee. The costs that are determined based on a percentage of revenues are expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized, and the minimum guarantee is expensed over the contract term.\nPosting, maintenance and other site-related expenses. These expenses primarily reflect costs associated with posting and rotation, materials, repairs and maintenance, utilities, property taxes and direct costs associated with our Sports Marketing operating segment.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard property lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>384.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit franchise\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Posting, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>859.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>835.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillboard property lease expenses represented 35% of billboard revenues in each of 2018 and 2017 and 34% in 2016. The increase in billboard property lease costs in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due the terms of the new New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA\u201d) billboard agreement, higher variable rent related to the increase in revenue and the impact of the Transaction. The increase in billboard property lease costs in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in Canada billboard property lease costs, primarily as a result of the impact of the Transaction, and an increase in U.S. Media segment billboard property lease costs, including a $1.5 million one-time true-up, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.0 million compared to 2016). Excluding the impact of the Disposition in 2016, billboard property lease expenses increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nTransit franchise expenses represented 59% of transit display revenues in 2018 and 63% in each of 2017 and 2016. The decrease in transit franchise expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the terms of the new MTA transit franchise agreement. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues, primarily from new contracts (primarily the MBTA), partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $0.8 million compared to 2016).\nBillboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $8.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $13.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016.\nPosting, maintenance and other expenses as a percentage of Revenues were 15% in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $16.0 million, or 7%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the impact of a new accounting standard on our Sports Marketing operating segment (see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements), higher costs related to third-party digital equipment sales and higher expenses related to our digital operations. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $3.7 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment, higher compensation and benefits-related costs, and the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $5.0 million compared to 2016). Excluding the impact of the Disposition, posting, maintenance and other expenses increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nSG&A expenses represented 18% of Revenues in 2018 and 17% in each of 2017 and 2016. SG&A expenses increased $25.3 million, or 10%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher compensation and other employee-related costs and higher strategic business development costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. SG&A expenses decreased $3.1 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower professional fees and the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.1 million compared to 2016), partially offset by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment. Excluding the impact of the Disposition, SG&A expenses in 2017 were comparable to 2016.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.1 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of various departments, for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our Sports Marketing operating segment management team and the elimination of a corporate management position. In 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $6.4 million for severance charges primarily associated with the Transaction. In 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.5 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our sales management and administrative functions.\nLoss on Real Estate Assets Held for Sale\nIn connection with the Disposition, the impact of including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses in the carrying value of assets held for sale resulted in a non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale of approximately $1.3 million in 2016. Upon completion of the Disposition in 2016, the unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment loss was reclassified to earnings from Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nNet Gain on Dispositions\nNet gain on dispositions was $5.5 million in 2018, $14.3 million in 2017, which includes a gain of $14.1 million from the acquisition of digital billboards in the Boston, Massachusetts, DMA in exchange for static billboards in four non-metropolitan market clusters, and $1.9 million in 2016.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation decreased $3.8 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increase in fully-depreciated advertising billboards, partially offset by higher depreciation as a result of an increased number of digital billboards. Depreciation decreased $19.2 million, or 18%, in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to the increase in fully-depreciated advertising billboards and the impact of the Disposition, partially offset by higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards.\nAmortization\nAmortization decreased $1.0 million, or 1%, in 2018 compared to 2017, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by higher direct lease acquisition costs. Amortization decreased $15.2 million, or 13%, in 2017 compared to 2016, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets. Amortization expense includes the amortization of direct lease acquisition costs of $43.2 million in 2018, $40.0 million in 2017 and $38.2 million in 2016. Capitalized direct lease acquisition costs were $43.2 million in 2018, $40.4 million in 2017 and $38.0 million in 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net, was $125.7 million (including $5.7 million of deferred financing costs) in 2018, $116.9 million (including $6.1 million of deferred financing costs) in 2017 and $113.8 million (including $6.4 million of deferred financing costs) in 2016. The increase in Interest expense, net, in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2016, was primarily due to higher interest rates, a higher outstanding average debt balance and letter of credit facility fees associated with the new MTA transit franchise agreement in 2018. (See the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Provision for income taxes was $4.9 million in 2018, $4.1 million in 2017 (including a $2.1 million effect from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on net deferred tax assets) and $5.4 million in 2016. The effective income tax rate was 4.7% for 2018, 3.3% for 2017 and 5.9% for 2016.\nNet Income\nNet income was $107.9 million in 2018, a decrease of $17.9 million compared to 2017, due primarily to an impairment charge of $42.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to our Canadian reporting unit (see the Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section of this MD&A), higher billboard property lease costs due to the terms of the MTA billboard agreement, higher costs related to third-party digital equipment sales, higher expense due to our digital operations, higher compensation and other employee-related costs, higher strategic business development costs and higher net interest expense, partially offset by higher revenues. Net income was $125.8 million in 2017, an increase of $34.9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization, a gain of $14.1 million from the acquisition of digital billboards in the Boston, Massachusetts, DMA in exchange for static billboards in four non-metropolitan market clusters, lower professional fees and the impact of the Disposition.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe present Adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for our reportable segments. (See the Key Performance Indicators\u201d section of this MD&A and Item 8., Note 19. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nAs of April 1, 2016, we manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other.

In the U.S. Media segment, billboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in 2018 and 35% in 2017, and transit franchise expenses represented 59% of transit revenues in 2018 and 63% in 2017. U.S. Media segment SG&A expenses increased $24.8 million, or 14%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher compensation and other employee-related costs, higher strategic business development

We generated approximately 43% in 2017 and 46% in 2016 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns.

The decrease in average revenue per display (yield) is primarily due to a reduction in national advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in local advertising revenues.\nOrganic revenues from U.S. Media segment billboards decreased $9.2 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), as discussed above, the net effect of new and lost billboards in the period, and the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets, partially offset by the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and higher proceeds from condemnations.\nTransit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $20.4 million, or 5%, in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period (primarily the MBTA), partially offset by lower revenues in New York due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield). The decrease in average revenue per display (yield) is primarily due to a reduction in national advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in local advertising revenues.\nOrganic transit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $20.5 million, or 5%, in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period (primarily the MBTA), partially offset by lower revenues in New York due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), as discussed above.\nU.S. Media segment operating expenses increased $15.2 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased transit franchise expenses resulting from an increase in transit revenues, primarily from new contracts, increased billboard property lease costs, including a $1.5 million one-time true-up, and higher compensation and benefits-related costs. In the U.S. Media segment, billboard property lease expenses represented 35% of billboard revenues in 2017 and 34% in 2016, and transit franchise expenses represented 63% of transit revenues in each of 2017 and 2016. U.S. Media segment SG&A expenses decreased $6.8 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower professional fees.\nU.S. Media segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $4.3 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016.\nOther\n2018 vs. 2017\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenues(a):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total organic revenues(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-organic revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-organic revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (gain) loss on dispositions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Calculation is not meaningful.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with a significant acquisition, the impact of a new accounting standard (see Item 8., Note 2.

Due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets, our revenues and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season. Further, certain of our municipal transit contracts, as well as our marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges and universities, require guaranteed minimum annual payments to be paid at the beginning of the year.\nOur short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, guaranteed minimum annual payments, capital expenditures, equipment deployment costs, interest and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), the AR Securitization Facilities (as defined below) or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nIn addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions, which transactions could be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof.\nOur long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and commitments related to operating leases and franchise and other agreements, including any related guaranteed minimum annual payments, and equipment deployment costs. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nThe decrease in working capital during 2018, is primarily due to higher short-term debt, accrued compensation and higher deferred revenues, partially offset by higher accounts receivables and higher prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs.\nUnder the MTA agreement, we are obligated to deploy, over a number of years, (i) 8,565 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, (ii) 37,716 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock (with deployment scheduled to commence in 2019), and (iii) 7,829 MTA communications displays. In addition, we are obligated to pay to the MTA the greater of a percentage of revenues or a guaranteed minimum annual payment. Incremental revenues that exceed an annual base revenue amount will be retained by us for the cost of deploying advertising and communications displays throughout the transit system. Based on our estimates and assumptions derived from costs of digital displays, materials and labor and the scope of deployment to date, our costs over the full 15-year term of the MTA agreement would be materially higher than our initial estimate of $800 million, however we are currently pursuing digital display cost reductions, installation efficiencies and changes to the scope of deployment that we believe will impact our estimates and assumptions. As presented in the table below, MTA equipment deployment costs are being recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and as these costs are recouped from incremental revenues that the MTA would otherwise be entitled to receive, Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs will be reduced. If incremental revenues generated over the term of the agreement are not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the equipment deployment costs, the costs will not be recouped, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We expect to utilize incremental third-party financing of approximately $350.0 million within the original four-year time frame to fund equipment deployment costs. As of December 31, 2018, our letters of credit for the benefit of the MTA aggregated approximately $136.0 million, which amount is subject to change as equipment installations are completed and revenues are generated. As indicated in the table below, we incurred $91.2 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs in 2018 (which includes equipment deployment costs related to 2019 deployments), for a total of $96.8 million to date, of which $1.7 million had been recouped from incremental revenues to date. As of December 31, 2018, 1,229 digital displays had been installed, of which 934 installations occurred in the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2019, we expect our MTA equipment deployment costs to be approximately $175.0 million. In addition, due to the change in the MTA's revenue share percentage under the agreement, our transit franchise operating expenses declined in 2018 to $233.8 million, as compared to prior historical periods, and we expect transit franchise operating expenses to gradually increase in subsequent years if our revenues increase over an annual base revenue amount.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td>

as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, a discount of $1.9 million on the Term Loan remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe also have a $430.0 million revolving credit facility, which matures in 2022 (the Revolving Credit Facility,\u201d and together with the Term Loan, the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was $1.4 million in 2018, $1.5 million in 2017 and $1.8 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $66.0 million against the letter of credit facility sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nStandalone Letter of Credit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $142.9 million under our aggregate $150.0 million standalone letter of credit facilities. The total fees under the letter of credit facilities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, were immaterial.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facilities\nOn September 6, 2018, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and MUFG Bank, Ltd. (f/k/a The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) ( MUFG\u201d) entered into amendments to the agreements governing the Company's $100.0 million three-year revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the AR Facility\u201d), along with other agreements with MUFG, pursuant to which the Company (i) extended the term of the AR Facility for one year so that it will now terminate on June 30, 2021, unless further extended, and (ii) entered into a 364-day $75.0 million structured repurchase facility (the Repurchase Facility\u201d and together with the AR Facility, the AR Securitization Facilities\u201d).\nIn connection with the AR Securitization Facilities, Outfront Media LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Originator\u201d), will sell and/or contribute its existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to Outfront Media Receivables LLC, a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the SPV\u201d). The SPV will transfer an undivided interest in the accounts receivable assets to certain purchasers from time to time (the Purchasers\u201d). The SPV is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPV's assets before the assets become available to the Company. Accordingly, the SPV's assets are not available to pay creditors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the Purchasers and other creditors of the SPV may be remitted to the Company.\nIn connection with the Repurchase Facility, the Originator may borrow up to $75.0 million, collateralized by a subordinated note (the Subordinated Note\u201d) issued by the SPV in favor of the Originator and representing a portion of the outstanding balance of the accounts receivable assets sold by the Originator to the SPV under the AR Facility. The Subordinated Note will be transferred to MUFG, as repurchase buyer, on an uncommitted basis, and subject to repurchase by the Originator on termination of the Repurchase Facility. The Originator has granted MUFG a security interest in the Subordinated Note to secure its obligations under the agreements governing the Repurchase Facility, and the Company has agreed to guarantee the Originator's obligations under the agreements governing the Repurchase Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were $85.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.5%, and $75.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility, at a borrowing of approximately 3.7%. As of December 31, 2018, borrowing capacity remaining under the AR Facility was approximately $15.0 million, based on approximately $216.0 million of accounts receivable used as collateral for the AR Securitization Facilities, and there was no borrowing capacity remaining under the Repurchase Facility, in accordance with the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities. The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the AR Facility was immaterial in 2018 and 2017. As of February 26, 2019, there were $65.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.6% and $75.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility, at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.7%.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nAs of December 31, 2018, a discount of $0.3 million on $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, a premium of $2.2 million on $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2024, remains unamortized. The premium is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDebt Covenants\nOur credit agreement, dated as of January 31, 2014 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement\u201d), governing the Senior Credit Facilities, the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities, and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that limit the Company's and our subsidiaries' abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company's or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC's\n( Finance LLC's\u201d) capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany or third-party transfers.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement (and under certain circumstances, the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities) require that we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.4 to 1.0 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires that, in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness, we maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was 4.6 to 1.0 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we are in compliance with our debt covenants.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had deferred $24.1 million in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, AR Securitization Facilities and our senior unsecured notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through Interest expense, net, on our Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, AR Securitization Facilities and our senior unsecured notes.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nWe are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we have variable-rate debt outstanding, including under our Senior Credit Facilities and the AR Securitization Facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into several interest rate cash flow swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our LIBOR-based variable rate debt to a fixed rate. The fair value of these swap positions was a net liability of approximately $2.4 million as of December 31, 2018, and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nAs of December 31, 2018, under the terms of the agreements, we will pay interest based on an aggregate notional amount of $150.0 million, under a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.0%, with a receive rate of one-month LIBOR and maturing on December 29, 2021. The one-month LIBOR rate was approximately 2.5% as of December 31, 2018.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering Program\nWe have a sales agreement in connection with an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program (the ATM Program\u201d), under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $300.0 million. We have no obligation to sell any of our common stock under the sales agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the sales agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 750,000 shares of our common stock were sold under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of $15.5 million with commissions of $0.2 million, for total net proceeds of $15.3 million.

In 2018, we paid $91.2 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs and installed 1,229 digital displays. In 2018, we recouped $1.7 million of MTA equipment deployment costs from incremental revenues. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $37.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016, principally as a result of the timing of payments made under the MTA agreement and lower net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. As a result of a change in the payment terms under the extensions to our previous MTA contracts, during 2017, we made payments to the MTA for percentage of revenues transit franchise fees due in excess of the guaranteed minimum payments related to both 2016 and 2017. The additional payment made in 2017 was $20.9 million. In 2017, we paid $4.7 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs that are expected to be recouped from incremental revenues under the MTA agreement.\nCash used for investing activities decreased $44.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $98.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2018, we incurred $82.3 million in capital expenditures and completed several acquisitions for total cash payments of approximately $7.0 million. In 2017, we incurred $70.8 million in capital expenditures, completed several acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $69.2 million, and received $5.6 million in proceeds from dispositions. In 2016, we completed several acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $67.9 million, incurred $59.4 million in capital expenditures and received $90.6 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the Disposition.\nThe following table presents our capital expenditures in 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital expenditures increased $11.5 million, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017, as we continue to spend on digital billboard and/or transit displays, improvements to our digital and static billboards, as well as improvements to our technology platform, partially offset by lower spending on vehicles and safety equipment. Capital expenditures increased $11.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by an increase in digital billboard and/or transit display spending.\nFor the full year of 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $80.0 million, which will be used primarily for maintenance, growth in digital displays, installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards, and to renovate certain office facilities. This estimate does not include equipment deployment costs that will be incurred in connection with the MTA agreement (as described above), which will be recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, as applicable.\nCash used for financing activities decreased $13.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased $155.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2018, we drew net borrowings of $80.0 million on the AR Securitization Facilities, received net proceeds of $15.3 million related to the sale of our common stock under the ATM Program and paid cash dividends of $203.9 million. In 2017, we drew net borrowings of $80.0 million on the AR Facility, received net proceeds from an incremental borrowing on the Term Loan of $8.3 million, paid cash dividends of $201.8 million and incurred additional deferred financing costs of $8.5 million. In 2016, we paid cash dividends of $188.6 million, and made discretionary payments totaling $90.0 million on the Term Loan.\nCash paid for income taxes was $8.4 million in 2018, $6.8 million in 2017 and $1.2 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 was due primarily to payments related to income from taxable REIT subsidiaries in 2017 and the payment of taxes on built-in gains on properties sold. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to higher income from taxable REIT subsidiaries in 2017 and the impact of a reimbursement of historical tax payments received in 2016 from our former parent company, CBS Corporation.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, our significant contractual obligations and payments due by period were as follows:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024 and thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed minimum annual payments(a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,733.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>374.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,256.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>574.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,170.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,620.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,734.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>897.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,336.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,016.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>We have agreements with municipalities and transit operators which entitle us to operate advertising displays within their transit systems, including on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars and buses, as well as on benches, transit shelters, street kiosks, and transit platforms.

Contributions to our pension plans were $2.0 million in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nFor further information about our contractual obligations, see Item 8, Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of operating lease arrangements and guaranteed minimum annual payments. (See Item 8, Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our off-balance sheet commitments.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are significant to its financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMTA Agreement\nUnder the MTA agreement, we are obligated to deploy, over a number of years, (i) 8,565 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, (ii) 37,716 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock (with deployment scheduled to commence in 2019), and (iii) 7,829 MTA communications displays. In addition, we are entitled to generate revenue through the sale of advertising on transit advertising displays and incur transit franchise expenses, which are calculated based on contractually stipulated percentages of revenue generated under the contract, subject to a minimum guarantee.\nAs title of the various digital displays transfers to the MTA on installation, the cost of deploying these screens throughout the transit system does not represent our property and equipment. The portion of deployment costs expected to be reimbursed from transit franchise fees that would otherwise be payable to the MTA are recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and charged to operating expenses as advertising revenue is generated. The short-term portion of Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs represents the costs that we expect to recover from the MTA in the next twelve months. The portion of deployment costs expected to be reimbursed from advertising revenues that would otherwise be retained by us under the contract are recorded as Intangible assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and charged to amortization expense on a straight line basis over the contract period.\nIf we do not generate sufficient advertising revenues from the MTA contract, there is a risk that the related Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets may not be recoverable. Impairment triggers for these assets are assessed on a quarterly basis. Based on our latest revenue projections, no impairment triggers were identified.\nGoodwill\nOn April 1, 2018, we early adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board's guidance simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. (See Note 2. New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Under that new guidance, which is applied prospectively, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference up to the carrying value of the goodwill.\nWe test goodwill qualitatively and/or quantitatively at the reporting-unit level annually for impairment on October 31 of each year and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. A qualitative test assesses macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity specific events, as well as events affecting a reporting unit. If after the qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative assessment. We may also choose to only perform a quantitative assessment. We compute the estimated fair value of each reporting unit for which we perform a quantitative assessment by adding the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. There can be no assurance that these estimates and assumptions will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future, and a downward revision of these estimates and/or assumptions would decrease the fair values of our reporting units, which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a qualitative and/or a quantitative assessment of our reporting units for possible goodwill impairment. No impairment was identified for any of our reporting units. Based on our most recent impairment analysis, the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 20% or more.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, our Canadian reporting unit did not meet revenue expectations and pacing reflected a decline as compared to the 2018 forecast due to the underperformance of our static poster assets and digital displays. As a result, we determined that there was a decline in the outlook for our Canadian reporting unit. This determination constituted a triggering event, requiring an interim goodwill impairment analysis of our Canadian reporting unit.\nAs a result of the impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2018, we determined that the carrying value of our Canadian reporting unit exceeded its fair value and we recorded an impairment charge of $42.9 million on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, goodwill related to our Canadian reporting unit, net of accumulated impairment of $42.9 million, was $19.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill associated with our Canadian reporting unit was $68.1 million.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe report long-lived assets, including billboard advertising structures, other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We depreciate or amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. For billboard advertising structures, we estimate the useful lives based on the estimated economic life of the asset. Transit fixed assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related contractual term. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of acquired permits and leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, which grant us the right to operate out-of-home advertising structures in specified locations and the right to provide advertising displays on railroad and municipal transit properties. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is the respective life of the agreement and in some cases includes an estimation for renewals, which is based on historical experience.\nLong-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization are also reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the long-lived asset might be impaired, by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets to the carrying values of those assets. The significant assumptions we use to determine the useful lives and fair values of long-lived assets include contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows and industry growth rates, as well as future salvage values.\nWe test for long-lived asset impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets to the respective asset's carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP. The amount of impairment loss, if any, will be measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset and recognized as a non-cash charge. Long-lived assets held for sale are required to be measured at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe record an asset retirement obligation for our estimated future legal obligation, upon termination or nonrenewal of a lease, associated with removing structures from the leased property and, when required by the contract, the cost to return the leased property to its original condition. These obligations are recorded at their present value in the period in which the liability is incurred and are capitalized as part of the related assets' carrying value. Accretion of the liability is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. The obligation is calculated based on the assumption that all of our advertising structures will be removed within the next 50 years. The significant assumptions used in estimating the asset retirement obligation include the cost of removing the asset, the cost of remediating the leased property to its original condition where required and the timing and number of lease renewals, all of which are estimated based on historical experience.\nAccounting Standards\nSee Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about adoption of new accounting standards and recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOUTFRONT Media is a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d), which provides advertising space ( displays\u201d) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the U.S.\u201d) and Canada. We manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other (see Item 8., Note 19. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America.\nOn April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the Disposition\u201d), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America. (See Item 8., Note 13. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included on our Consolidated Financial Statements for 2016, and are included in Other in our segment reporting.\nBusiness\nWe are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas ( DMAs\u201d), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. and Canada. We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and approximately 140 markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser's website or retail location one mile down the road.\u201d\nIn addition to providing location-based displays, we also focus on delivering audiences to our customers. Using Geopath, the out-of-home advertising industry's audience measurement system, we provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays or a complete campaign. As part of our ON Smart Media platform, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. Additionally, our OUTFRONT Mobile Network allows our customers to further leverage location targeting with interactive mobile advertising that uses geofence technology and other data to push mobile ads to consumers within a pre-defined radius around a corresponding billboard display or other designated advertising location. Further, our social influence add-on product allows our customers to leverage location targeting with social sharing amplification.\nWe believe out-of-home advertising continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective stand-alone\u201d medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio, print, online, mobile and social media advertising platforms. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, attribution, consumer insights, creative design support through OUTFRONT Studios, print production and post-campaign tracking and analytics, as well as use of a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for substantially all of our business.\nU.S. Media. Our U.S. Media segment generated 22% of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in 2018, 23% in 2017 and 25% in 2016, and generated 16% in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our U.S. Media segment generated Revenues of $1,466.8 million in 2018, $1,406.5 million in 2017 and $1,393.8 million in 2016, and Operating income before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Impairment charges and Loss on real estate assets held for sale ( Adjusted OIBDA\u201d) of $500.2 million in 2018, $478.1 million in 2017 and $473.8 million in 2016. (See the Segment Results of Operations\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nOther (includes International and Sports Marketing). Other generated Revenues of $139.4 million in 2018, $114.0 million in 2017 and $120.1 million in 2016, and Adjusted OIBDA of $17.3 million in 2018, $8.4 million in 2017 and $17.8 million in 2016.\nEconomic Environment\nOur revenues and operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in advertising expenditures, general economic conditions and other external events beyond our control.\nBusiness Environment\nThe outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several companies operating on a national basis, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for both customers and structure and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional advertising platforms (such as television, radio, print and direct mail marketers). In addition, we compete with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters supermarkets and taxis.\nIncreasing the number of digital displays in our prime audience locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce print production and installation costs. In addition, digital displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display. Digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays. Digital billboard displays also incur, on average, approximately two to four times more costs, including higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue than traditional static billboard displays. As a result, digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays. The majority of our digital billboard displays were converted from traditional static billboard displays.\nIn 2017, we commenced deployment of state-of-the-art digital transit displays in connection with several transit franchises and are planning to increase deployments significantly over the coming years. Once the digital transit displays have been deployed at scale, we expect that revenue generated on digital transit displays will be a multiple of the revenue generated on comparable static transit displays. We intend to incur significant equipment deployment costs and capital expenditures in the coming years to continue increasing the number of digital displays in our portfolio.\nWe have built or converted 57 new digital billboard displays in the United States and 26 in Canada in 2018. Additionally, in 2018, we installed 56 small-format digital displays and entered into marketing arrangements to sell advertising on 18 third-party digital billboard displays in the U.S. with a net decrease of three third-party digital billboard displays in Canada. In 2018, we have built, converted or replaced 1,646 digital transit and other displays in the United States. The following table sets forth information regarding our digital displays.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Revenues (in millions)\nfor the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Digital Displays\nas of December 31, 2018(a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Billboard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Transit and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Digital Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Billboard Displays\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Digital Transit and Other Displays\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Digital Displays\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Digital display amounts (1) include displays reserved for transit agency use and (2) exclude: (i) all displays under our multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions; and (ii) 1,649 MetroCard vending machine digital screens. Our number of digital displays is impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, management agreements, the net effect of new and lost billboards, and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period. \nOur revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season.\nWe have a diversified base of customers across various industries. During 2018, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, computers/internet and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 8%, and 8% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2017, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, healthcare/pharmaceuticals and television, which represented 9%, 8% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues. During 2016, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 7% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively.\nOur large-scale portfolio allows our customers to reach a national audience and also provides the flexibility to tailor campaigns to specific regions or markets. In 2018, we generated approximately 44% of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns, compared to 45% in 2017 and 47% in 2016.\nOur transit businesses require us to periodically obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain or renew contracts.\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on the indicators described below.\nSeveral of our key performance indicators are not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,606.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,520.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenues(a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,586.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,513.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>479.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA(b) margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations ( FFO\u201d)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted FFO ( AFFO\u201d)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with a significant acquisition, the impact of a new accounting standard (See Item 8., Note 2.

We provide organic revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of non-organic revenue items. Our management believes organic revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since organic revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Organic revenues, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \n (b) See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d and Revenues\u201d sections of this MD&A for reconciliations of Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, Net income to FFO and AFFO and Revenues to organic revenues. \nAdjusted OIBDA\nWe calculate Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, net (gain) loss on dispositions, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and loss on real estate assets held for sale. We calculate Adjusted OIBDA margin by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are among the primary measures we use for managing our business, evaluating our operating performance and planning and forecasting future periods, as each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because eliminating certain non-comparable items highlight operational trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier for users of our financial data to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.\nFFO and AFFO\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO reflects net income (loss) adjusted to exclude gains and losses from the sale of real estate assets, impairment charges, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, amortization of direct lease acquisition costs and the same adjustments for our equity-based investments, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We calculate AFFO as FFO adjusted to include cash paid for direct lease acquisition costs as such costs are generally amortized over a period ranging from four weeks to one year and therefore are incurred on a regular basis. AFFO also includes cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures since these are routine uses of cash that are necessary for our operations. In addition, AFFO excludes costs related to restructuring charges, as well as certain non-cash items, including non-real estate depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, accretion expense, the non-cash effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred financing costs, and the non-cash portion of income taxes, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We use FFO and AFFO measures for managing our business and for planning and forecasting future periods, and each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance, especially compared to other REITs. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of FFO and AFFO, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because adjusting results to reflect items that have more bearing on the operating performance of REITs highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our\nfinancial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier to compare our results to other companies in our industry, as well as to REITs.\nSince Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin, FFO and AFFO are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, these measures do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP

Contingent rent is generally paid in arrears and is expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized.\nTransit franchise expenses. These expenses reflect costs charged by municipalities and transit operators under transit advertising contracts and are generally calculated based on a percentage of the revenues we generate under the contract, with a minimum guarantee. The costs that are determined based on a percentage of revenues are expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized, and the minimum guarantee is expensed over the contract term.\nPosting, maintenance and other site-related expenses. These expenses primarily reflect costs associated with posting and rotation, materials, repairs and maintenance, utilities, property taxes and direct costs associated with our Sports Marketing operating segment.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard property lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>384.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit franchise\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Posting, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>859.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>835.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillboard property lease expenses represented 35% of billboard revenues in each of 2018 and 2017 and 34% in 2016. The increase in billboard property lease costs in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due the terms of the new New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA\u201d) billboard agreement, higher variable rent related to the increase in revenue and the impact of the Transaction. The increase in billboard property lease costs in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in Canada billboard property lease costs, primarily as a result of the impact of the Transaction, and an increase in U.S. Media segment billboard property lease costs, including a $1.5 million one-time true-up, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.0 million compared to 2016). Excluding the impact of the Disposition in 2016, billboard property lease expenses increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nTransit franchise expenses represented 59% of transit display revenues in 2018 and 63% in each of 2017 and 2016. The decrease in transit franchise expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the terms of the new MTA transit franchise agreement. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues, primarily from new contracts (primarily the MBTA), partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $0.8 million compared to 2016).\nBillboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $8.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $13.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016.\nPosting, maintenance and other expenses as a percentage of Revenues were 15% in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $16.0 million, or 7%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the impact of a new accounting standard on our Sports Marketing operating segment (see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements), higher costs related to third-party digital equipment sales and higher expenses related to our digital operations. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $3.7 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment, higher compensation and benefits-related costs, and the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $5.0 million compared to 2016). Excluding the impact of the Disposition, posting, maintenance and other expenses increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nSG&A expenses represented 18% of Revenues in 2018 and 17% in each of 2017 and 2016. SG&A expenses increased $25.3 million, or 10%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher compensation and other employee-related costs and higher strategic business development costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. SG&A expenses decreased $3.1 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower professional fees and the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.1 million compared to 2016), partially offset by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment. Excluding the impact of the Disposition, SG&A expenses in 2017 were comparable to 2016.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.1 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of various departments, for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our Sports Marketing operating segment management team and the elimination of a corporate management position. In 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $6.4 million for severance charges primarily associated with the Transaction. In 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.5 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our sales management and administrative functions.\nLoss on Real Estate Assets Held for Sale\nIn connection with the Disposition, the impact of including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses in the carrying value of assets held for sale resulted in a non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale of approximately $1.3 million in 2016. Upon completion of the Disposition in 2016, the unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment loss was reclassified to earnings from Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nNet Gain on Dispositions\nNet gain on dispositions was $5.5 million in 2018, $14.3 million in 2017, which includes a gain of $14.1 million from the acquisition of digital billboards in the Boston, Massachusetts, DMA in exchange for static billboards in four non-metropolitan market clusters, and $1.9 million in 2016.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation decreased $3.8 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increase in fully-depreciated advertising billboards, partially offset by higher depreciation as a result of an increased number of digital billboards. Depreciation decreased $19.2 million, or 18%, in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to the increase in fully-depreciated advertising billboards and the impact of the Disposition, partially offset by higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards.\nAmortization\nAmortization decreased $1.0 million, or 1%, in 2018 compared to 2017, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by higher direct lease acquisition costs. Amortization decreased $15.2 million, or 13%, in 2017 compared to 2016, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets. Amortization expense includes the amortization of direct lease acquisition costs of $43.2 million in 2018, $40.0 million in 2017 and $38.2 million in 2016. Capitalized direct lease acquisition costs were $43.2 million in 2018, $40.4 million in 2017 and $38.0 million in 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net, was $125.7 million (including $5.7 million of deferred financing costs) in 2018, $116.9 million (including $6.1 million of deferred financing costs) in 2017 and $113.8 million (including $6.4 million of deferred financing costs) in 2016. The increase in Interest expense, net, in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2016, was primarily due to higher interest rates, a higher outstanding average debt balance and letter of credit facility fees associated with the new MTA transit franchise agreement in 2018. (See the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Provision for income taxes was $4.9 million in 2018, $4.1 million in 2017 (including a $2.1 million effect from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on net deferred tax assets) and $5.4 million in 2016. The effective income tax rate was 4.7% for 2018, 3.3% for 2017 and 5.9% for 2016.\nNet Income\nNet income was $107.9 million in 2018, a decrease of $17.9 million compared to 2017, due primarily to an impairment charge of $42.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to our Canadian reporting unit (see the Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section of this MD&A), higher billboard property lease costs due to the terms of the MTA billboard agreement, higher costs related to third-party digital equipment sales, higher expense due to our digital operations, higher compensation and other employee-related costs, higher strategic business development costs and higher net interest expense, partially offset by higher revenues. Net income was $125.8 million in 2017, an increase of $34.9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization, a gain of $14.1 million from the acquisition of digital billboards in the Boston, Massachusetts, DMA in exchange for static billboards in four non-metropolitan market clusters, lower professional fees and the impact of the Disposition.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe present Adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for our reportable segments. (See the Key Performance Indicators\u201d section of this MD&A and Item 8., Note 19. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nAs of April 1, 2016, we manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other. Our segment reporting therefore includes U.S. Media and Other.\nThe following table presents our Revenues, Adjusted OIBDA and Operating income (loss) by segment in 2018, 2017 and 2016. On April 1, 2016, we completed the Disposition. The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included in Other.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the conversion of traditional static billboard and transit displays to digital displays and an increase in average revenue per display (yield) in billboards, partially offset by lower proceeds from condemnations. We generated approximately 44% in 2018 and 45% in 2017 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns.\nRevenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $42.9 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by lower proceeds from condemnations.\nTransit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $17.4 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by growth in digital displays and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period.\nU.S. Media segment operating expenses increased $13.4 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher billboard property lease costs, due primarily to the new MTA billboard agreement, and higher expenses related to our digital operations, partially offset by lower transit franchise expenses in connection with the new MTA transit franchise agreement. In the U.S. Media segment, billboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in 2018 and 35% in 2017, and transit franchise expenses represented 59% of transit revenues in 2018 and 63% in 2017. U.S. Media segment SG&A expenses increased $24.8 million, or 14%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher compensation and other employee-related costs, higher strategic business development costs and higher professional fees, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.\nU.S. Media segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $22.1 million, or 5%, in 2018 compared to 2017.\n2017 vs. 2016\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>997.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,005.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>408.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>388.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,406.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,393.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenues(a):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>992.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,001.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total organic revenues(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,394.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,383.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-organic revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-organic revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,406.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,393.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(754.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(739.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(180.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (gain) loss on dispositions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Calculation not meaningful. \n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \nTotal U.S. Media segment revenues increased $12.7 million, or 1%, and U.S. Media segment organic revenues increased $11.3 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016.

Corporate expenses in 2017 decreased slightly compared to 2016, primarily reflecting lower professional fees, partially offset by costs incurred in connection with amending the Senior Credit Facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables, less allowances of $10.7 in 2018 and $11.5 in 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaid lease and transit franchise costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other prepaid expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>429.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued lease costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other accrued expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nWe continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets, our revenues and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season. Further, certain of our municipal transit contracts, as well as our marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges and universities, require guaranteed minimum annual payments to be paid at the beginning of the year.\nOur short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, guaranteed minimum annual payments, capital expenditures, equipment deployment costs, interest and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), the AR Securitization Facilities (as defined below) or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nIn addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions, which transactions could be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof.\nOur long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and commitments related to operating leases and franchise and other agreements, including any related guaranteed minimum annual payments, and equipment deployment costs. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nThe decrease in working capital during 2018, is primarily due to higher short-term debt, accrued compensation and higher deferred revenues, partially offset by higher accounts receivables and higher prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs.\nUnder the MTA agreement, we are obligated to deploy, over a number of years, (i) 8,565 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, (ii) 37,716 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock (with deployment scheduled to commence in 2019), and (iii) 7,829 MTA communications displays. In addition, we are obligated to pay to the MTA the greater of a percentage of revenues or a guaranteed minimum annual payment. Incremental revenues that exceed an annual base revenue amount will be retained by us for the cost of deploying advertising and communications displays throughout the transit system. Based on our estimates and assumptions derived from costs of digital displays, materials and labor and the scope of deployment to date, our costs over the full 15-year term of the MTA agreement would be materially higher than our initial estimate of $800 million, however we are currently pursuing digital display cost reductions, installation efficiencies and changes to the scope of deployment that we believe will impact our estimates and assumptions. As presented in the table below, MTA equipment deployment costs are being recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and as these costs are recouped from incremental revenues that the MTA would otherwise be entitled to receive, Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs will be reduced. If incremental revenues generated over the term of the agreement are not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the equipment deployment costs, the costs will not be recouped, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We expect to utilize incremental third-party financing of approximately $350.0 million within the original four-year time frame to fund equipment deployment costs. As of December 31, 2018, our letters of credit for the benefit of the MTA aggregated approximately $136.0 million, which amount is subject to change as equipment installations are completed and revenues are generated. As indicated in the table below, we incurred $91.2 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs in 2018 (which includes equipment deployment costs related to 2019 deployments), for a total of $96.8 million to date, of which $1.7 million had been recouped from incremental revenues to date. As of December 31, 2018, 1,229 digital displays had been installed, of which 934 installations occurred in the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2019, we expect our MTA equipment deployment costs to be approximately $175.0 million. In addition, due to the change in the MTA's revenue share percentage under the agreement, our transit franchise operating expenses declined in 2018 to $233.8 million, as compared to prior historical periods, and we expect transit franchise operating expenses to gradually increase in subsequent years if our revenues increase over an annual base revenue amount.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td>

As of December 31, 2018, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $66.0 million against the letter of credit facility sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nStandalone Letter of Credit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $142.9 million under our aggregate $150.0 million standalone letter of credit facilities. The total fees under the letter of credit facilities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, were immaterial.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facilities\nOn September 6, 2018, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and MUFG Bank, Ltd. (f/k/a The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) ( MUFG\u201d) entered into amendments to the agreements governing the Company's $100.0 million three-year revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the AR Facility\u201d), along with other agreements with MUFG, pursuant to which the Company (i) extended the term of the AR Facility for one year so that it will now terminate on June 30, 2021, unless further extended, and (ii) entered into a 364-day $75.0 million structured repurchase facility (the Repurchase Facility\u201d and together with the AR Facility, the AR Securitization Facilities\u201d).\nIn connection with the AR Securitization Facilities, Outfront Media LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Originator\u201d), will sell and/or contribute its existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to Outfront Media Receivables LLC, a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the SPV\u201d). The SPV will transfer an undivided interest in the accounts receivable assets to certain purchasers from time to time (the Purchasers\u201d). The SPV is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPV's assets before the assets become available to the Company. Accordingly, the SPV's assets are not available to pay creditors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the Purchasers and other creditors of the SPV may be remitted to the Company.\nIn connection with the Repurchase Facility, the Originator may borrow up to $75.0 million, collateralized by a subordinated note (the Subordinated Note\u201d) issued by the SPV in favor of the Originator and representing a portion of the outstanding balance of the accounts receivable assets sold by the Originator to the SPV under the AR Facility. The Subordinated Note will be transferred to MUFG, as repurchase buyer, on an uncommitted basis, and subject to repurchase by the Originator on termination of the Repurchase Facility. The Originator has granted MUFG a security interest in the Subordinated Note to secure its obligations under the agreements governing the Repurchase Facility, and the Company has agreed to guarantee the Originator's obligations under the agreements governing the Repurchase Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were $85.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.5%, and $75.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility, at a borrowing of approximately 3.7%. As of December 31, 2018, borrowing capacity remaining under the AR Facility was approximately $15.0 million, based on approximately $216.0 million of accounts receivable used as collateral for the AR Securitization Facilities, and there was no borrowing capacity remaining under the Repurchase Facility, in accordance with the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities. The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the AR Facility was immaterial in 2018 and 2017. As of February 26, 2019, there were $65.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.6% and $75.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility, at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.7%.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nAs of December 31, 2018, a discount of $0.3 million on $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, a premium of $2.2 million on $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2024, remains unamortized. The premium is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDebt Covenants\nOur credit agreement, dated as of January 31, 2014 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement\u201d), governing the Senior Credit Facilities, the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities, and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that limit the Company's and our subsidiaries' abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company's or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC's\n( Finance LLC's\u201d) capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany or third-party transfers.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement (and under certain circumstances, the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities) require that we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.4 to 1.0 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires that, in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness, we maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was 4.6 to 1.0 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we are in compliance with our debt covenants.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had deferred $24.1 million in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, AR Securitization Facilities and our senior unsecured notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through Interest expense, net, on our Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, AR Securitization Facilities and our senior unsecured notes.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nWe are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we have variable-rate debt outstanding, including under our Senior Credit Facilities and the AR Securitization Facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into several interest rate cash flow swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our LIBOR-based variable rate debt to a fixed rate. The fair value of these swap positions was a net liability of approximately $2.4 million as of December 31, 2018, and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nAs of December 31, 2018, under the terms of the agreements, we will pay interest based on an aggregate notional amount of $150.0 million, under a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.0%, with a receive rate of one-month LIBOR and maturing on December 29, 2021. The one-month LIBOR rate was approximately 2.5% as of December 31, 2018.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering Program\nWe have a sales agreement in connection with an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program (the ATM Program\u201d), under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $300.0 million. We have no obligation to sell any of our common stock under the sales agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the sales agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 750,000 shares of our common stock were sold under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of $15.5 million with commissions of $0.2 million, for total net proceeds of $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had $284.5 million of capacity remaining under the ATM Program.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows in 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(135.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(117.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nCash provided by operating activities decreased $35.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017, principally as a result of prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs, an increase in accounts receivables due to the timing of collections and an increase in long-term prepaid transit franchise costs, partially offset by the timing of payments of percentage rents due under the MTA transit franchise agreement and higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. In 2018, we paid $91.2 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs and installed 1,229 digital displays. In 2018, we recouped $1.7 million of MTA equipment deployment costs from incremental revenues. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $37.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016, principally as a result of the timing of payments made under the MTA agreement and lower net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. As a result of a change in the payment terms under the extensions to our previous MTA contracts, during 2017, we made payments to the MTA for percentage of revenues transit franchise fees due in excess of the guaranteed minimum payments related to both 2016 and 2017. The additional payment made in 2017 was $20.9 million. In 2017, we paid $4.7 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs that are expected to be recouped from incremental revenues under the MTA agreement.\nCash used for investing activities decreased $44.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $98.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2018, we incurred $82.3 million in capital expenditures and completed several acquisitions for total cash payments of approximately $7.0 million. In 2017, we incurred $70.8 million in capital expenditures, completed several acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $69.2 million, and received $5.6 million in proceeds from dispositions. In 2016, we completed several acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $67.9 million, incurred $59.4 million in capital expenditures and received $90.6 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the Disposition.\nThe following table presents our capital expenditures in 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital expenditures increased $11.5 million, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017, as we continue to spend on digital billboard and/or transit displays, improvements to our digital and static billboards, as well as improvements to our technology platform, partially offset by lower spending on vehicles and safety equipment. Capital expenditures increased $11.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by an increase in digital billboard and/or transit display spending.\nFor the full year of 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $80.0 million, which will be used primarily for maintenance, growth in digital displays, installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards, and to renovate certain office facilities. This estimate does not include equipment deployment costs that will be incurred in connection with the MTA agreement (as described above), which will be recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, as applicable.\nCash used for financing activities decreased $13.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased $155.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2018, we drew net borrowings of $80.0 million on the AR Securitization Facilities, received net proceeds of $15.3 million related to the sale of our common stock under the ATM Program and paid cash dividends of $203.9 million. In 2017, we drew net borrowings of $80.0 million on the AR Facility, received net proceeds from an incremental borrowing on the Term Loan of $8.3 million, paid cash dividends of $201.8 million and incurred additional deferred financing costs of $8.5 million. In 2016, we paid cash dividends of $188.6 million, and made discretionary payments totaling $90.0 million on the Term Loan.\nCash paid for income taxes was $8.4 million in 2018, $6.8 million in 2017 and $1.2 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 was due primarily to payments related to income from taxable REIT subsidiaries in 2017 and the payment of taxes on built-in gains on properties sold. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to higher income from taxable REIT subsidiaries in 2017 and the impact of a reimbursement of historical tax payments received in 2016 from our former parent company, CBS Corporation.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, our significant contractual obligations and payments due by period were as follows:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024 and thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed minimum annual payments(a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,733.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>374.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>769.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,256.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>574.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,170.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,620.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,734.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>897.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,336.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,016.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) We have agreements with municipalities and transit operators which entitle us to operate advertising displays within their transit systems, including on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars and buses, as well as on benches, transit shelters, street kiosks, and transit platforms. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenues, net of agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. Franchise rights are generally paid monthly, or in some cases upfront at the beginning of the year. \n (b) We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. Under most of these agreements, the school is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenue, net of agency commissions, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. \n (c) Consists of non-cancellable operating leases with original terms in excess of one year for billboard sites, office space and equipment. Total future minimum payments of $1,256.3 million include $1,170.1 million for our billboard sites. Excludes rent on cancellable leases with original terms of under one year, as well as contingent rent. \n (d) As of December 31, 2018, we had long-term debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Interest on the Term Loan is variable. For illustrative purposes, we are assuming an interest rate of 4.3% for all years, which reflects the interest rate as of December 31, 2018. An increase or decrease of 1/4% in the interest rate will change the annual interest expense by $1.3 million. \nThe above table excludes $0.6 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as we cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments related to this obligation.\nIn 2019, we expect to contribute $1.0 million to our pension plans. Contributions to our pension plans were $2.0 million in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nFor further information about our contractual obligations, see Item 8, Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of operating lease arrangements and guaranteed minimum annual payments. (See Item 8, Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our off-balance sheet commitments.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are significant to its financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMTA Agreement\nUnder the MTA agreement, we are obligated to deploy, over a number of years, (i) 8,565 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, (ii) 37,716 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock (with deployment scheduled to commence in 2019), and (iii) 7,829 MTA communications displays. In addition, we are entitled to generate revenue through the sale of advertising on transit advertising displays and incur transit franchise expenses, which are calculated based on contractually stipulated percentages of revenue generated under the contract, subject to a minimum guarantee.\nAs title of the various digital displays transfers to the MTA on installation, the cost of deploying these screens throughout the transit system does not represent our property and equipment. The portion of deployment costs expected to be reimbursed from transit franchise fees that would otherwise be payable to the MTA are recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and charged to operating expenses as advertising revenue is generated. The short-term portion of Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs represents the costs that we expect to recover from the MTA in the next twelve months. The portion of deployment costs expected to be reimbursed from advertising revenues that would otherwise be retained by us under the contract are recorded as Intangible assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and charged to amortization expense on a straight line basis over the contract period.\nIf we do not generate sufficient advertising revenues from the MTA contract, there is a risk that the related Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets may not be recoverable. Impairment triggers for these assets are assessed on a quarterly basis. Based on our latest revenue projections, no impairment triggers were identified.\nGoodwill\nOn April 1, 2018, we early adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board's guidance simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. (See Note 2. New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Under that new guidance, which is applied prospectively, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference up to the carrying value of the goodwill.\nWe test goodwill qualitatively and/or quantitatively at the reporting-unit level annually for impairment on October 31 of each year and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. A qualitative test assesses macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity specific events, as well as events affecting a reporting unit. If after the qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative assessment. We may also choose to only perform a quantitative assessment. We compute the estimated fair value of each reporting unit for which we perform a quantitative assessment by adding the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. There can be no assurance that these estimates and assumptions will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future, and a downward revision of these estimates and/or assumptions would decrease the fair values of our reporting units, which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a qualitative and/or a quantitative assessment of our reporting units for possible goodwill impairment. No impairment was identified for any of our reporting units. Based on our most recent impairment analysis, the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 20% or more.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, our Canadian reporting unit did not meet revenue expectations and pacing reflected a decline as compared to the 2018 forecast due to the underperformance of our static poster assets and digital displays. As a result, we determined that there was a decline in the outlook for our Canadian reporting unit. This determination constituted a triggering event, requiring an interim goodwill impairment analysis of our Canadian reporting unit.\nAs a result of the impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2018, we determined that the carrying value of our Canadian reporting unit exceeded its fair value and we recorded an impairment charge of $42.9 million on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, goodwill related to our Canadian reporting unit, net of accumulated impairment of $42.9 million, was $19.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill associated with our Canadian reporting unit was $68.1 million.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe report long-lived assets, including billboard advertising structures, other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We depreciate or amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. For billboard advertising structures, we estimate the useful lives based on the estimated economic life of the asset. Transit fixed assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related contractual term. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of acquired permits and leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, which grant us the right to operate out-of-home advertising structures in specified locations and the right to provide advertising displays on railroad and municipal transit properties. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is the respective life of the agreement and in some cases includes an estimation for renewals, which is based on historical experience.\nLong-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization are also reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the long-lived asset might be impaired, by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets to the carrying values of those assets. The significant assumptions we use to determine the useful lives and fair values of long-lived assets include contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows and industry growth rates, as well as future salvage values.\nWe test for long-lived asset impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets to the respective asset's carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP. The amount of impairment loss, if any, will be measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset and recognized as a non-cash charge. Long-lived assets held for sale are required to be measured at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe record an asset retirement obligation for our estimated future legal obligation, upon termination or nonrenewal of a lease, associated with removing structures from the leased property and, when required by the contract, the cost to return the leased property to its original condition. These obligations are recorded at their present value in the period in which the liability is incurred and are capitalized as part of the related assets' carrying value. Accretion of the liability is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. The obligation is calculated based on the assumption that all of our advertising structures will be removed within the next 50 years. The significant assumptions used in estimating the asset retirement obligation include the cost of removing the asset, the cost of remediating the leased property to its original condition where required and the timing and number of lease renewals, all of which are estimated based on historical experience.\nAccounting Standards\nSee Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about adoption of new accounting standards and recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOUTFRONT Media is a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d), which provides advertising space ( displays\u201d) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the U.S.\u201d) and Canada. We manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other (see Item 8., Note 19. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America.\nOn April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the Disposition\u201d), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America. (See Item 8., Note 13. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included on our Consolidated Financial Statements for 2016, and are included in Other in our segment reporting.\nBusiness\nWe are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas ( DMAs\u201d), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. and Canada. We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and approximately 140 markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser's website or retail location one mile down the road.\u201d\nIn addition to providing location-based displays, we also focus on delivering audiences to our customers. Using Geopath, the out-of-home advertising industry's audience measurement system, we provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays or a complete campaign. As part of our ON Smart Media platform, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. Additionally, our OUTFRONT Mobile Network allows our customers to further leverage location targeting with interactive mobile advertising that uses geofence technology and other data to push mobile ads to consumers within a pre-defined radius around a corresponding billboard display or other designated advertising location. Further, our social influence add-on product allows our customers to leverage location targeting with social sharing amplification.\nWe believe out-of-home advertising continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective stand-alone\u201d medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio, print, online, mobile and social media advertising platforms. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, attribution, consumer insights, creative design support through OUTFRONT Studios, print production and post-campaign tracking and analytics, as well as use of a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for substantially all of our business.\nU.S. Media. Our U.S. Media segment generated 22% of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in 2018, 23% in 2017 and 25% in 2016, and generated 16% in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our U.S. Media segment generated Revenues of $1,466.8 million in 2018, $1,406.5 million in 2017 and $1,393.8 million in 2016, and Operating income before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Impairment charges and Loss on real estate assets held for sale ( Adjusted OIBDA\u201d) of $500.2 million in 2018, $478.1 million in 2017 and $473.8 million in 2016. (See the Segment Results of Operations\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nOther (includes International and Sports Marketing). Other generated Revenues of $139.4 million in 2018, $114.0 million in 2017 and $120.1 million in 2016, and Adjusted OIBDA of $17.3 million in 2018, $8.4 million in 2017 and $17.8 million in 2016.\nEconomic Environment\nOur revenues and operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in advertising expenditures, general economic conditions and other external events beyond our control.\nBusiness Environment\nThe outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several companies operating on a national basis, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for both customers and structure and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional advertising platforms (such as television, radio, print and direct mail marketers). In addition, we compete with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters supermarkets and taxis.\nIncreasing the number of digital displays in our prime audience locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce print production and installation costs. In addition, digital displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display. Digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays. Digital billboard displays also incur, on average, approximately two to four times more costs, including higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue than traditional static billboard displays. As a result, digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays. The majority of our digital billboard displays were converted from traditional static billboard displays.\nIn 2017, we commenced deployment of state-of-the-art digital transit displays in connection with several transit franchises and are planning to increase deployments significantly over the coming years. Once the digital transit displays have been deployed at scale, we expect that revenue generated on digital transit displays will be a multiple of the revenue generated on comparable static transit displays. We intend to incur significant equipment deployment costs and capital expenditures in the coming years to continue increasing the number of digital displays in our portfolio.\nWe have built or converted 57 new digital billboard displays in the United States and 26 in Canada in 2018. Additionally, in 2018, we installed 56 small-format digital displays and entered into marketing arrangements to sell advertising on 18 third-party digital billboard displays in the U.S. with a net decrease of three third-party digital billboard displays in Canada. In 2018, we have built, converted or replaced 1,646 digital transit and other displays in the United States. The following table sets forth information regarding our digital displays.\n\n (a) Digital display amounts (1) include displays reserved for transit agency use and (2) exclude: (i) all displays under our multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions; and (ii) 1,649 MetroCard vending machine digital screens. Our number of digital displays is impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, management agreements, the net effect of new and lost billboards, and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period. \nOur revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season.\nWe have a diversified base of customers across various industries. During 2018, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, computers/internet and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 8%, and 8% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2017, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, healthcare/pharmaceuticals and television, which represented 9%, 8% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues. During 2016, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 7% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively.\nOur large-scale portfolio allows our customers to reach a national audience and also provides the flexibility to tailor campaigns to specific regions or markets. In 2018, we generated approximately 44% of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns, compared to 45% in 2017 and 47% in 2016.\nOur transit businesses require us to periodically obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain or renew contracts.\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on the indicators described below.\nSeveral of our key performance indicators are not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with a significant acquisition, the impact of a new accounting standard (See Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). We provide organic revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of non-organic revenue items. Our management believes organic revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since organic revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Organic revenues, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \n (b) See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d and Revenues\u201d sections of this MD&A for reconciliations of Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, Net income to FFO and AFFO and Revenues to organic revenues. \nAdjusted OIBDA\nWe calculate Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, net (gain) loss on dispositions, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and loss on real estate assets held for sale. We calculate Adjusted OIBDA margin by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are among the primary measures we use for managing our business, evaluating our operating performance and planning and forecasting future periods, as each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because eliminating certain non-comparable items highlight operational trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier for users of our financial data to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.\nFFO and AFFO\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO reflects net income (loss) adjusted to exclude gains and losses from the sale of real estate assets, impairment charges, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, amortization of direct lease acquisition costs and the same adjustments for our equity-based investments, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We calculate AFFO as FFO adjusted to include cash paid for direct lease acquisition costs as such costs are generally amortized over a period ranging from four weeks to one year and therefore are incurred on a regular basis. AFFO also includes cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures since these are routine uses of cash that are necessary for our operations. In addition, AFFO excludes costs related to restructuring charges, as well as certain non-cash items, including non-real estate depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, accretion expense, the non-cash effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred financing costs, and the non-cash portion of income taxes, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We use FFO and AFFO measures for managing our business and for planning and forecasting future periods, and each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance, especially compared to other REITs. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of FFO and AFFO, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because adjusting results to reflect items that have more bearing on the operating performance of REITs highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our\nfinancial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier to compare our results to other companies in our industry, as well as to REITs.\nSince Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin, FFO and AFFO are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, these measures do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, and Net income to FFO and AFFO.\n\n (a) Income tax effect related to Net gain on disposition of real estate assets. \n (b) Income tax effect related to Restructuring charges. \nFFO in 2018 of $301.0 million increased $23.7 million, or 9%, compared to 2017. AFFO in 2018 of $299.7 million increased $22.1 million, or 8%, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items and lower maintenance capital expenditures, partially offset by lower restructuring charges.\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive Revenues primarily from providing advertising space to customers on our advertising structures and sites. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year. Revenues from billboard displays are recognized as rental income on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Transit and other revenues are recognized over the contract period. (See Item 8., Note 11. Revenues to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)\n2018 vs. 2017\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with a significant acquisition, the impact of a new accounting standard (see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \nOn June 13, 2017, certain subsidiaries of OUTFRONT Media Inc. acquired the equity interests of certain subsidiaries of All Vision LLC ( All Vision\u201d), which hold substantially all of All Vision's outdoor advertising assets in Canada, and effectuated an amalgamation of All Vision's Canadian business with our Canadian business (the Transaction\u201d).\nTotal revenues increased $85.7 million, or 6%, and organic revenues increased $73.3 million, or 5%, in 2018 compared to 2017.\nIn 2018, non-organic revenues reflect an acquisition and the impact of a new accounting standard (see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2017, non-organic revenues reflect an acquisition and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.\nTotal billboard revenues increased $53.4 million, or 5%, in 2018 compared to 2017, principally driven by an increase in average revenue per display (yield), the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and the impact of the Transaction, partially offset by lower proceeds from condemnations.\nOrganic billboard revenues in 2018 increased $47.9 million, or 5%, compared to 2017, due to an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by lower proceeds from condemnations.\nTotal transit and other revenues increased $32.3 million, or 7%, in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by growth in digital displays, the impact of a new accounting standard on our Sports Marketing operating segment and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period.\nThe increase in organic transit and other revenues in 2018 compared to 2017, is due to growth in digital displays and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period.\n2017 vs. 2016\n\n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \nTotal revenues increased $6.6 million and organic revenues increased $8.4 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016.\nIn 2017, non-organic revenues primarily reflects acquisitions. In 2016, non-organic revenues primarily reflects an acquisition and a disposition, as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.\nTotal billboard revenues decreased $12.0 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016, principally driven by a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), the net effect of new and lost billboards in the period, the impact of the Disposition and the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets, partially offset by the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, higher proceeds from condemnations and the impact of the Transaction (as defined in the Segments Results of Operations: Other\u201d section of this MD&A). The decrease in average revenue per display (yield) is primarily due to a reduction in national advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in local advertising revenues.\nThe decrease in organic billboard revenues in 2017 compared to 2016, is due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), as discussed above, the net effect of new and lost billboards in the period, the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets, and lower performance in Canada, partially offset by the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and higher proceeds from condemnations.\nTotal transit and other revenues increased $18.6 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period (primarily the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (the MBTA\u201d)), partially offset by lower revenues in New York due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), and the impact of the Disposition. The decrease in average revenue per display (yield) is primarily due to a reduction in national advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in local advertising revenues.\nThe increase in organic transit and other revenues in 2017 compared to 2016, is due to the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period (primarily the MBTA), partially offset by lower revenues in New York due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), as discussed above.\nExpenses\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are composed of the following:\nBillboard property lease expenses. These expenses reflect the cost of leasing the real property on which our billboards are mounted. These lease agreements have terms varying between one month and multiple years, and usually provide renewal options. Rental expenses are comprised of a fixed monthly amount and under certain agreements, also include contingent rent, which varies based on the revenues we generate from the leased site. The fixed portion of property leases are generally paid in advance for periods ranging from one to twelve months and expensed evenly over the contract term. Contingent rent is generally paid in arrears and is expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized.\nTransit franchise expenses. These expenses reflect costs charged by municipalities and transit operators under transit advertising contracts and are generally calculated based on a percentage of the revenues we generate under the contract, with a minimum guarantee. The costs that are determined based on a percentage of revenues are expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized, and the minimum guarantee is expensed over the contract term.\nPosting, maintenance and other site-related expenses. These expenses primarily reflect costs associated with posting and rotation, materials, repairs and maintenance, utilities, property taxes and direct costs associated with our Sports Marketing operating segment.\n\nBillboard property lease expenses represented 35% of billboard revenues in each of 2018 and 2017 and 34% in 2016. The increase in billboard property lease costs in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due the terms of the new New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA\u201d) billboard agreement, higher variable rent related to the increase in revenue and the impact of the Transaction. The increase in billboard property lease costs in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in Canada billboard property lease costs, primarily as a result of the impact of the Transaction, and an increase in U.S. Media segment billboard property lease costs, including a $1.5 million one-time true-up, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.0 million compared to 2016). Excluding the impact of the Disposition in 2016, billboard property lease expenses increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nTransit franchise expenses represented 59% of transit display revenues in 2018 and 63% in each of 2017 and 2016. The decrease in transit franchise expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the terms of the new MTA transit franchise agreement. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues, primarily from new contracts (primarily the MBTA), partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $0.8 million compared to 2016).\nBillboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $8.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $13.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016.\nPosting, maintenance and other expenses as a percentage of Revenues were 15% in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $16.0 million, or 7%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the impact of a new accounting standard on our Sports Marketing operating segment (see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements), higher costs related to third-party digital equipment sales and higher expenses related to our digital operations. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $3.7 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment, higher compensation and benefits-related costs, and the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $5.0 million compared to 2016). Excluding the impact of the Disposition, posting, maintenance and other expenses increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nSG&A expenses represented 18% of Revenues in 2018 and 17% in each of 2017 and 2016. SG&A expenses increased $25.3 million, or 10%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher compensation and other employee-related costs and higher strategic business development costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. SG&A expenses decreased $3.1 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower professional fees and the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.1 million compared to 2016), partially offset by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment. Excluding the impact of the Disposition, SG&A expenses in 2017 were comparable to 2016.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.1 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of various departments, for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our Sports Marketing operating segment management team and the elimination of a corporate management position. In 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $6.4 million for severance charges primarily associated with the Transaction. In 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.5 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our sales management and administrative functions.\nLoss on Real Estate Assets Held for Sale\nIn connection with the Disposition, the impact of including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses in the carrying value of assets held for sale resulted in a non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale of approximately $1.3 million in 2016. Upon completion of the Disposition in 2016, the unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment loss was reclassified to earnings from Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nNet Gain on Dispositions\nNet gain on dispositions was $5.5 million in 2018, $14.3 million in 2017, which includes a gain of $14.1 million from the acquisition of digital billboards in the Boston, Massachusetts, DMA in exchange for static billboards in four non-metropolitan market clusters, and $1.9 million in 2016.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation decreased $3.8 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increase in fully-depreciated advertising billboards, partially offset by higher depreciation as a result of an increased number of digital billboards. Depreciation decreased $19.2 million, or 18%, in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to the increase in fully-depreciated advertising billboards and the impact of the Disposition, partially offset by higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards.\nAmortization\nAmortization decreased $1.0 million, or 1%, in 2018 compared to 2017, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by higher direct lease acquisition costs. Amortization decreased $15.2 million, or 13%, in 2017 compared to 2016, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets. Amortization expense includes the amortization of direct lease acquisition costs of $43.2 million in 2018, $40.0 million in 2017 and $38.2 million in 2016. Capitalized direct lease acquisition costs were $43.2 million in 2018, $40.4 million in 2017 and $38.0 million in 2016.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net, was $125.7 million (including $5.7 million of deferred financing costs) in 2018, $116.9 million (including $6.1 million of deferred financing costs) in 2017 and $113.8 million (including $6.4 million of deferred financing costs) in 2016. The increase in Interest expense, net, in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2016, was primarily due to higher interest rates, a higher outstanding average debt balance and letter of credit facility fees associated with the new MTA transit franchise agreement in 2018. (See the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Provision for income taxes was $4.9 million in 2018, $4.1 million in 2017 (including a $2.1 million effect from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on net deferred tax assets) and $5.4 million in 2016. The effective income tax rate was 4.7% for 2018, 3.3% for 2017 and 5.9% for 2016.\nNet Income\nNet income was $107.9 million in 2018, a decrease of $17.9 million compared to 2017, due primarily to an impairment charge of $42.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to our Canadian reporting unit (see the Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section of this MD&A), higher billboard property lease costs due to the terms of the MTA billboard agreement, higher costs related to third-party digital equipment sales, higher expense due to our digital operations, higher compensation and other employee-related costs, higher strategic business development costs and higher net interest expense, partially offset by higher revenues. Net income was $125.8 million in 2017, an increase of $34.9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization, a gain of $14.1 million from the acquisition of digital billboards in the Boston, Massachusetts, DMA in exchange for static billboards in four non-metropolitan market clusters, lower professional fees and the impact of the Disposition.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe present Adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for our reportable segments. (See the Key Performance Indicators\u201d section of this MD&A and Item 8., Note 19. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nAs of April 1, 2016, we manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other. Our segment reporting therefore includes U.S. Media and Other.\nThe following table presents our Revenues, Adjusted OIBDA and Operating income (loss) by segment in 2018, 2017 and 2016. On April 1, 2016, we completed the Disposition. The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included in Other.\n\n (a) Stock-based compensation is classified as Corporate expense. \nU.S. Media\n2018 vs. 2017\n\nTotal U.S. Media segment revenues increased $60.3 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the conversion of traditional static billboard and transit displays to digital displays and an increase in average revenue per display (yield) in billboards, partially offset by lower proceeds from condemnations. We generated approximately 44% in 2018 and 45% in 2017 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns.\nRevenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $42.9 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by lower proceeds from condemnations.\nTransit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $17.4 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by growth in digital displays and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period.\nU.S. Media segment operating expenses increased $13.4 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher billboard property lease costs, due primarily to the new MTA billboard agreement, and higher expenses related to our digital operations, partially offset by lower transit franchise expenses in connection with the new MTA transit franchise agreement. In the U.S. Media segment, billboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in 2018 and 35% in 2017, and transit franchise expenses represented 59% of transit revenues in 2018 and 63% in 2017. U.S. Media segment SG&A expenses increased $24.8 million, or 14%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher compensation and other employee-related costs, higher strategic business development costs and higher professional fees, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.\nU.S. Media segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $22.1 million, or 5%, in 2018 compared to 2017.\n2017 vs. 2016\n\n * Calculation not meaningful. \n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \nTotal U.S. Media segment revenues increased $12.7 million, or 1%, and U.S. Media segment organic revenues increased $11.3 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Non-organic revenues primarily reflect an acquisition.\nTotal U.S. Media segment revenue grew in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period (primarily the MBTA), the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and higher proceeds from condemnations, partially offset by a decrease in average revenue per display (yield) in billboards and transit, the net effect of new and lost billboards in the period, and the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets. We generated approximately 43% in 2017 and 46% in 2016 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns. We have seen a softening of advertising revenues from national accounts across a variety of industry categories, primarily automotive, travel/leisure and retail.\nRevenues from U.S. Media segment billboards decreased $7.7 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), the net effect of new and lost billboards in the period, and the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets, partially offset by the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and higher proceeds from condemnations. The decrease in average revenue per display (yield) is primarily due to a reduction in national advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in local advertising revenues.\nOrganic revenues from U.S. Media segment billboards decreased $9.2 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), as discussed above, the net effect of new and lost billboards in the period, and the impact of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets, partially offset by the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and higher proceeds from condemnations.\nTransit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $20.4 million, or 5%, in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period (primarily the MBTA), partially offset by lower revenues in New York due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield). The decrease in average revenue per display (yield) is primarily due to a reduction in national advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in local advertising revenues.\nOrganic transit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $20.5 million, or 5%, in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period (primarily the MBTA), partially offset by lower revenues in New York due to a decrease in average revenue per display (yield), as discussed above.\nU.S. Media segment operating expenses increased $15.2 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased transit franchise expenses resulting from an increase in transit revenues, primarily from new contracts, increased billboard property lease costs, including a $1.5 million one-time true-up, and higher compensation and benefits-related costs. In the U.S. Media segment, billboard property lease expenses represented 35% of billboard revenues in 2017 and 34% in 2016, and transit franchise expenses represented 63% of transit revenues in each of 2017 and 2016. U.S. Media segment SG&A expenses decreased $6.8 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower professional fees.\nU.S. Media segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $4.3 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016.\nOther\n2018 vs. 2017\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with a significant acquisition, the impact of a new accounting standard (see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards) and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \nTotal Other revenues increased $25.4 million, or 22%, in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the impact of a new accounting standard on our Sports Marketing operating segment (see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the impact of the Transaction and an increase in third-party digital equipment sales.\nOther operating expenses increased $11.3 million, or 14%, in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by the impact of a new accounting standard on our Sports Marketing operating segment, the impact of the Transaction and higher costs related to third-party digital equipment sales. Other SG&A expenses increased $5.2 million, or 21%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by the impact of a new accounting standard on our Sports Marketing operating segment and the impact of the Transaction.\nOther Adjusted OIBDA increased $8.9 million, or 106%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by the impact of the Transaction and improved performance in Canada.\n2017 vs. 2016\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \nTotal Other revenues decreased $6.1 million, or 5%, in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $11.4 million), partially offset by the impact of the Transaction.\nOther operating expenses increased $1.9 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by higher expenses related to renewed contracts in our Sports Marketing operating segment, the impact of the Transaction and foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $8.8 million). Other SG&A expenses increased $1.4\nmillion, or 6%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment, the impact of the Transaction and foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.1 million).\nOther Adjusted OIBDA decreased $9.4 million, or 53%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by our Sports Marketing operating segment and lower performance in Canada, partially offset by the impacts of both the Transaction and the Disposition.\nCorporate\nCorporate expenses primarily include expenses associated with employees who provide centralized services. Corporate expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and restructuring charges, were $38.0 million in 2018, $42.4 million in 2017 and $42.6 million in 2016. Corporate expenses decreased $4.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to lower compensation-related expenses in 2018 and one-time expenses in 2017, including higher professional fees and costs incurred in connection with amending our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined in the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this MD&A). Corporate expenses in 2017 decreased slightly compared to 2016, primarily reflecting lower professional fees, partially offset by costs incurred in connection with amending the Senior Credit Facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nWe continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets, our revenues and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season. Further, certain of our municipal transit contracts, as well as our marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges and universities, require guaranteed minimum annual payments to be paid at the beginning of the year.\nOur short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, guaranteed minimum annual payments, capital expenditures, equipment deployment costs, interest and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), the AR Securitization Facilities (as defined below) or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nIn addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions, which transactions could be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof.\nOur long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and commitments related to operating leases and franchise and other agreements, including any related guaranteed minimum annual payments, and equipment deployment costs. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nThe decrease in working capital during 2018, is primarily due to higher short-term debt, accrued compensation and higher deferred revenues, partially offset by higher accounts receivables and higher prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs.\nUnder the MTA agreement, we are obligated to deploy, over a number of years, (i) 8,565 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, (ii) 37,716 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock (with deployment scheduled to commence in 2019), and (iii) 7,829 MTA communications displays. In addition, we are obligated to pay to the MTA the greater of a percentage of revenues or a guaranteed minimum annual payment. Incremental revenues that exceed an annual base revenue amount will be retained by us for the cost of deploying advertising and communications displays throughout the transit system. Based on our estimates and assumptions derived from costs of digital displays, materials and labor and the scope of deployment to date, our costs over the full 15-year term of the MTA agreement would be materially higher than our initial estimate of $800 million, however we are currently pursuing digital display cost reductions, installation efficiencies and changes to the scope of deployment that we believe will impact our estimates and assumptions. As presented in the table below, MTA equipment deployment costs are being recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and as these costs are recouped from incremental revenues that the MTA would otherwise be entitled to receive, Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs will be reduced. If incremental revenues generated over the term of the agreement are not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the equipment deployment costs, the costs will not be recouped, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We expect to utilize incremental third-party financing of approximately $350.0 million within the original four-year time frame to fund equipment deployment costs. As of December 31, 2018, our letters of credit for the benefit of the MTA aggregated approximately $136.0 million, which amount is subject to change as equipment installations are completed and revenues are generated. As indicated in the table below, we incurred $91.2 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs in 2018 (which includes equipment deployment costs related to 2019 deployments), for a total of $96.8 million to date, of which $1.7 million had been recouped from incremental revenues to date. As of December 31, 2018, 1,229 digital displays had been installed, of which 934 installations occurred in the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2019, we expect our MTA equipment deployment costs to be approximately $175.0 million. In addition, due to the change in the MTA's revenue share percentage under the agreement, our transit franchise operating expenses declined in 2018 to $233.8 million, as compared to prior historical periods, and we expect transit franchise operating expenses to gradually increase in subsequent years if our revenues increase over an annual base revenue amount.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of approximately $2.3 billion.\nOn February 26, 2019, we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share on our common stock, payable on March 29, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2019.\nDebt\nDebt, net, consists of the following:\n\n\nTerm Loan\nThe interest rate on the term loan due in 2024 (the Term Loan\u201d) was 4.3% per annum as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, a discount of $1.9 million on the Term Loan remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe also have a $430.0 million revolving credit facility, which matures in 2022 (the Revolving Credit Facility,\u201d and together with the Term Loan, the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was $1.4 million in 2018, $1.5 million in 2017 and $1.8 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $66.0 million against the letter of credit facility sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nStandalone Letter of Credit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $142.9 million under our aggregate $150.0 million standalone letter of credit facilities. The total fees under the letter of credit facilities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, were immaterial.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facilities\nOn September 6, 2018, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and MUFG Bank, Ltd. (f/k/a The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) ( MUFG\u201d) entered into amendments to the agreements governing the Company's $100.0 million three-year revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the AR Facility\u201d), along with other agreements with MUFG, pursuant to which the Company (i) extended the term of the AR Facility for one year so that it will now terminate on June 30, 2021, unless further extended, and (ii) entered into a 364-day $75.0 million structured repurchase facility (the Repurchase Facility\u201d and together with the AR Facility, the AR Securitization Facilities\u201d).\nIn connection with the AR Securitization Facilities, Outfront Media LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Originator\u201d), will sell and/or contribute its existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to Outfront Media Receivables LLC, a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the SPV\u201d). The SPV will transfer an undivided interest in the accounts receivable assets to certain purchasers from time to time (the Purchasers\u201d). The SPV is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPV's assets before the assets become available to the Company. Accordingly, the SPV's assets are not available to pay creditors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the Purchasers and other creditors of the SPV may be remitted to the Company.\nIn connection with the Repurchase Facility, the Originator may borrow up to $75.0 million, collateralized by a subordinated note (the Subordinated Note\u201d) issued by the SPV in favor of the Originator and representing a portion of the outstanding balance of the accounts receivable assets sold by the Originator to the SPV under the AR Facility. The Subordinated Note will be transferred to MUFG, as repurchase buyer, on an uncommitted basis, and subject to repurchase by the Originator on termination of the Repurchase Facility. The Originator has granted MUFG a security interest in the Subordinated Note to secure its obligations under the agreements governing the Repurchase Facility, and the Company has agreed to guarantee the Originator's obligations under the agreements governing the Repurchase Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were $85.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.5%, and $75.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility, at a borrowing of approximately 3.7%. As of December 31, 2018, borrowing capacity remaining under the AR Facility was approximately $15.0 million, based on approximately $216.0 million of accounts receivable used as collateral for the AR Securitization Facilities, and there was no borrowing capacity remaining under the Repurchase Facility, in accordance with the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities. The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the AR Facility was immaterial in 2018 and 2017. As of February 26, 2019, there were $65.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.6% and $75.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility, at a borrowing rate of approximately 3.7%.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nAs of December 31, 2018, a discount of $0.3 million on $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, a premium of $2.2 million on $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2024, remains unamortized. The premium is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDebt Covenants\nOur credit agreement, dated as of January 31, 2014 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement\u201d), governing the Senior Credit Facilities, the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities, and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that limit the Company's and our subsidiaries' abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company's or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC's\n( Finance LLC's\u201d) capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany or third-party transfers.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement (and under certain circumstances, the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities) require that we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.4 to 1.0 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires that, in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness, we maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was 4.6 to 1.0 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we are in compliance with our debt covenants.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had deferred $24.1 million in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, AR Securitization Facilities and our senior unsecured notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through Interest expense, net, on our Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, AR Securitization Facilities and our senior unsecured notes.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nWe are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we have variable-rate debt outstanding, including under our Senior Credit Facilities and the AR Securitization Facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into several interest rate cash flow swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our LIBOR-based variable rate debt to a fixed rate. The fair value of these swap positions was a net liability of approximately $2.4 million as of December 31, 2018, and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nAs of December 31, 2018, under the terms of the agreements, we will pay interest based on an aggregate notional amount of $150.0 million, under a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.0%, with a receive rate of one-month LIBOR and maturing on December 29, 2021. The one-month LIBOR rate was approximately 2.5% as of December 31, 2018.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering Program\nWe have a sales agreement in connection with an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program (the ATM Program\u201d), under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $300.0 million. We have no obligation to sell any of our common stock under the sales agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the sales agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 750,000 shares of our common stock were sold under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of $15.5 million with commissions of $0.2 million, for total net proceeds of $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had $284.5 million of capacity remaining under the ATM Program.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows in 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nCash provided by operating activities decreased $35.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017, principally as a result of prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs, an increase in accounts receivables due to the timing of collections and an increase in long-term prepaid transit franchise costs, partially offset by the timing of payments of percentage rents due under the MTA transit franchise agreement and higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. In 2018, we paid $91.2 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs and installed 1,229 digital displays. In 2018, we recouped $1.7 million of MTA equipment deployment costs from incremental revenues. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $37.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016, principally as a result of the timing of payments made under the MTA agreement and lower net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. As a result of a change in the payment terms under the extensions to our previous MTA contracts, during 2017, we made payments to the MTA for percentage of revenues transit franchise fees due in excess of the guaranteed minimum payments related to both 2016 and 2017. The additional payment made in 2017 was $20.9 million. In 2017, we paid $4.7 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs that are expected to be recouped from incremental revenues under the MTA agreement.\nCash used for investing activities decreased $44.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $98.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2018, we incurred $82.3 million in capital expenditures and completed several acquisitions for total cash payments of approximately $7.0 million. In 2017, we incurred $70.8 million in capital expenditures, completed several acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $69.2 million, and received $5.6 million in proceeds from dispositions. In 2016, we completed several acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $67.9 million, incurred $59.4 million in capital expenditures and received $90.6 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the Disposition.\nThe following table presents our capital expenditures in 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\nCapital expenditures increased $11.5 million, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017, as we continue to spend on digital billboard and/or transit displays, improvements to our digital and static billboards, as well as improvements to our technology platform, partially offset by lower spending on vehicles and safety equipment. Capital expenditures increased $11.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by an increase in digital billboard and/or transit display spending.\nFor the full year of 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $80.0 million, which will be used primarily for maintenance, growth in digital displays, installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards, and to renovate certain office facilities. This estimate does not include equipment deployment costs that will be incurred in connection with the MTA agreement (as described above), which will be recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, as applicable.\nCash used for financing activities decreased $13.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased $155.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2018, we drew net borrowings of $80.0 million on the AR Securitization Facilities, received net proceeds of $15.3 million related to the sale of our common stock under the ATM Program and paid cash dividends of $203.9 million. In 2017, we drew net borrowings of $80.0 million on the AR Facility, received net proceeds from an incremental borrowing on the Term Loan of $8.3 million, paid cash dividends of $201.8 million and incurred additional deferred financing costs of $8.5 million. In 2016, we paid cash dividends of $188.6 million, and made discretionary payments totaling $90.0 million on the Term Loan.\nCash paid for income taxes was $8.4 million in 2018, $6.8 million in 2017 and $1.2 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 was due primarily to payments related to income from taxable REIT subsidiaries in 2017 and the payment of taxes on built-in gains on properties sold. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to higher income from taxable REIT subsidiaries in 2017 and the impact of a reimbursement of historical tax payments received in 2016 from our former parent company, CBS Corporation.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, our significant contractual obligations and payments due by period were as follows:\n\n (a) We have agreements with municipalities and transit operators which entitle us to operate advertising displays within their transit systems, including on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars and buses, as well as on benches, transit shelters, street kiosks, and transit platforms. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenues, net of agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. Franchise rights are generally paid monthly, or in some cases upfront at the beginning of the year. \n (b) We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. Under most of these agreements, the school is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenue, net of agency commissions, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. \n (c) Consists of non-cancellable operating leases with original terms in excess of one year for billboard sites, office space and equipment. Total future minimum payments of $1,256.3 million include $1,170.1 million for our billboard sites. Excludes rent on cancellable leases with original terms of under one year, as well as contingent rent. \n (d) As of December 31, 2018, we had long-term debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Interest on the Term Loan is variable. For illustrative purposes, we are assuming an interest rate of 4.3% for all years, which reflects the interest rate as of December 31, 2018. An increase or decrease of 1/4% in the interest rate will change the annual interest expense by $1.3 million. \nThe above table excludes $0.6 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as we cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments related to this obligation.\nIn 2019, we expect to contribute $1.0 million to our pension plans. Contributions to our pension plans were $2.0 million in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nFor further information about our contractual obligations, see Item 8, Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of operating lease arrangements and guaranteed minimum annual payments. (See Item 8, Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our off-balance sheet commitments.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are significant to its financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMTA Agreement\nUnder the MTA agreement, we are obligated to deploy, over a number of years, (i) 8,565 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, (ii) 37,716 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock (with deployment scheduled to commence in 2019), and (iii) 7,829 MTA communications displays. In addition, we are entitled to generate revenue through the sale of advertising on transit advertising displays and incur transit franchise expenses, which are calculated based on contractually stipulated percentages of revenue generated under the contract, subject to a minimum guarantee.\nAs title of the various digital displays transfers to the MTA on installation, the cost of deploying these screens throughout the transit system does not represent our property and equipment. The portion of deployment costs expected to be reimbursed from transit franchise fees that would otherwise be payable to the MTA are recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and charged to operating expenses as advertising revenue is generated. The short-term portion of Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs represents the costs that we expect to recover from the MTA in the next twelve months. The portion of deployment costs expected to be reimbursed from advertising revenues that would otherwise be retained by us under the contract are recorded as Intangible assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and charged to amortization expense on a straight line basis over the contract period.\nIf we do not generate sufficient advertising revenues from the MTA contract, there is a risk that the related Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets may not be recoverable. Impairment triggers for these assets are assessed on a quarterly basis. Based on our latest revenue projections, no impairment triggers were identified.\nGoodwill\nOn April 1, 2018, we early adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board's guidance simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. (See Note 2. New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Under that new guidance, which is applied prospectively, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference up to the carrying value of the goodwill.\nWe test goodwill qualitatively and/or quantitatively at the reporting-unit level annually for impairment on October 31 of each year and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. A qualitative test assesses macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity specific events, as well as events affecting a reporting unit. If after the qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative assessment. We may also choose to only perform a quantitative assessment. We compute the estimated fair value of each reporting unit for which we perform a quantitative assessment by adding the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. There can be no assurance that these estimates and assumptions will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future, and a downward revision of these estimates and/or assumptions would decrease the fair values of our reporting units, which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a qualitative and/or a quantitative assessment of our reporting units for possible goodwill impairment. No impairment was identified for any of our reporting units. Based on our most recent impairment analysis, the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 20% or more.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, our Canadian reporting unit did not meet revenue expectations and pacing reflected a decline as compared to the 2018 forecast due to the underperformance of our static poster assets and digital displays. As a result, we determined that there was a decline in the outlook for our Canadian reporting unit. This determination constituted a triggering event, requiring an interim goodwill impairment analysis of our Canadian reporting unit.\nAs a result of the impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2018, we determined that the carrying value of our Canadian reporting unit exceeded its fair value and we recorded an impairment charge of $42.9 million on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, goodwill related to our Canadian reporting unit, net of accumulated impairment of $42.9 million, was $19.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill associated with our Canadian reporting unit was $68.1 million.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe report long-lived assets, including billboard advertising structures, other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We depreciate or amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. For billboard advertising structures, we estimate the useful lives based on the estimated economic life of the asset. Transit fixed assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related contractual term. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of acquired permits and leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, which grant us the right to operate out-of-home advertising structures in specified locations and the right to provide advertising displays on railroad and municipal transit properties. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is the respective life of the agreement and in some cases includes an estimation for renewals, which is based on historical experience.\nLong-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization are also reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the long-lived asset might be impaired, by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets to the carrying values of those assets. The significant assumptions we use to determine the useful lives and fair values of long-lived assets include contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows and industry growth rates, as well as future salvage values.\nWe test for long-lived asset impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets to the respective asset's carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP. The amount of impairment loss, if any, will be measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset and recognized as a non-cash charge. Long-lived assets held for sale are required to be measured at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe record an asset retirement obligation for our estimated future legal obligation, upon termination or nonrenewal of a lease, associated with removing structures from the leased property and, when required by the contract, the cost to return the leased property to its original condition. These obligations are recorded at their present value in the period in which the liability is incurred and are capitalized as part of the related assets' carrying value. Accretion of the liability is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. The obligation is calculated based on the assumption that all of our advertising structures will be removed within the next 50 years. The significant assumptions used in estimating the asset retirement obligation include the cost of removing the asset, the cost of remediating the leased property to its original condition where required and the timing and number of lease renewals, all of which are estimated based on historical experience.\nAccounting Standards\nSee Item 8., Note 2.

report:\n\nOverview\n- OUTFRONT Media is a REIT that provides advertising space on out-of-home structures like billboards and transit displays in the US and Canada. \n- It operates through three segments: U.S. Billboard and Transit, International, and Sports Marketing.\n- Its revenues and profits are impacted by seasonal advertising patterns, general economic conditions, and events affecting advertising markets.\n\n2018 Financial Highlights\n- Total revenues were $1.61 billion, up 6% organically from 2017. Billboard and transit/other revenues grew due to higher average revenue per display and more digital billboard conversions.\n- Operating income was $234.8 million compared to $241.7 million in 2017. Net income was $107.9 million, down from $125.8 million in 2017, largely due to a $42.9 million impairment charge in Canada.\n- Adjusted OIBDA margin was 30% compared to 29% in 2017.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- As of December 31, 2018, the company had $2.31 billion of total debt outstanding and was in compliance with debt covenants.  \n- In 2018, cash flows from operations were $214.3 million. $82.3 million was spent on capital expenditures, and $91.2 million on MTA equipment deployment costs.\n- For 2019, capital expenditures are expected to be ~$80 million, not including additional MTA deployment costs estimated at $175 million.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies & Estimates\n- Key policies relate to accounting for the MTA agreement, goodwill and impairment testing, asset retirement obligations, and adoption of new accounting standards. These involve significant judgments, estimates and assumptions by management."}
