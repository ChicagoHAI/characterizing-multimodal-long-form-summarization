Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and other factors described throughout this Form 10-K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. - Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe believe that the assumptions underlying the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report are reasonable. However, the Consolidated Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows for future periods.\nOVERVIEW\nTribune Publishing Company, formerly tronc, Inc., was formed as a Delaware corporation on November 21, 2013.

These activities have in the past included, and could include in the future, outsourcing of various functions or operations, additional abandonment of leased space and other activities which may result in changes to employee headcount. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on changes in operations during fiscal year 2018. The Company expects to continue to take actions deemed appropriate to enhance profitability but does not currently know whether or when any such actions will occur or the potential costs and expected savings. Depending on the actions taken and the timing of any such actions, the anticipated cost savings could be recognized in fiscal periods that do not correspond to the fiscal period(s) in which the charges are recognized. As a result, the Company's net income trends could be impacted and more difficult to predict.\n2018 Highlights and Recent Events\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On January 29, 2018, the Company and Cars.com, LLC agreed to convert the Company's affiliate markets into Cars.com's direct retail channel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On February 6, 2018, the Company acquired a 60% membership interest in BestReviews LLC ( BestReviews\u201d), a company engaged in the business of testing, researching and reviewing consumer products.

negative change in excess of 100%\nYear ended December 30, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nOperating Revenues-Operating revenues increased 1.5%, or $15.2 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the combined impact of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017, BestReviews in the first quarter of 2018 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018. Such acquisitions contributed $175.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $40.2 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was partially offset by a $111.9 million decrease in advertising revenue, $3.4 million decrease in circulation revenue and a $4.7 million decrease in other revenue. The decrease in advertising revenue includes $39.9 million related to the conversion of the Cars.com agreement.\nCompensation Expense-Compensation expense increased 9.1%, or $36.8 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior period. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $98.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $29.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase from acquisitions was partially offset by a decrease in salary expense of $37.6 million as a result of the reduction in headcount due to current and prior periods personnel restructuring.\nNewsprint and Ink Expense-Newsprint and ink expense increased 11.6%, or $6.9 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $17.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to the increase related to the acquisitions, the Company experienced a 23.1% increase in average cost per ton of newsprint, related to a proposed tariff on certain newsprint products sourced from Canada. These increases were partially offset by a 13.4% decrease in consumption.\nOutside Services Expense-Outside services expense increased 5.3%, or $17.6 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $35.9 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $7.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as expense related to the Consulting Agreement described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases were partially offset by decreases in circulation and distribution expenses of $15.8 million, outsourced services of $2.9 million and outside printing and production expenses of $1.9 million.\nOther Expenses-Other expenses include occupancy costs, promotion and marketing costs, affiliate fees and other miscellaneous expenses. These expenses increased 0.7%, or $1.2 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $48.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was partially offset by a $33.1 million decrease in affiliate fees related to the conversion of the Cars.com agreement and a $7.7 million decrease in bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense-Depreciation and amortization expense increased 12.6%, or $6.0 million, for the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $6.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nImpairment Expense-In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.9 million related to the goodwill associated with the Sun Sentinel Media Group.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense decreased as the Senior Term Facility was repaid in full in June 2018. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt repayment.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt-In June 2018, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance under the Senior Term Facility and terminated the agreement. As a result of the early extinguishment of debt, the Company incurred a $7.7 million loss to expense the remaining balance of original issue discount and debt origination fees. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt repayment.\nPremium on Stock Buyback-On March 23, 2017, the Company repurchased 3,745,947 shares of the Company's stock for $56.2 million, or $15 per common share. The fair value of the stock as of the purchase date was $50.2 million, or $13.39 per common share. The $6.0 million difference between the purchase price and the transaction date fair value was recorded as a a non-operating expense. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLoss on Equity Investments, Net-Loss on equity investments, net was consistent with the prior year.\nOther Income, Net - The increase in other income, net is primarily due to increased credits related to early termination of certain postretirement benefit plans. Due to an accounting standard change, credits for amortization of prior service costs related to such plans are reported in Other Income, Net, instead of Compensation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the standard change and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefits.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)-Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $19.9 million for the year ended December 30, 2018, over the prior year period primarily due to prior year tax law changes and lower taxable income. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The effects of the changes in tax rates are required to be recognized in the period enacted and as a result, the Company recorded $10.8 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The Company has recorded an additional $0.2 million of expense in the third quarter of 2018, to bring the total expense to $11.0 million. The additional provision resulted from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation of the tax law change.\nThe effective tax rate on pretax income was 24.2% and (31.8)% in the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nOperating Revenues-Operating revenues decreased 4.5%, or $47.9 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period due to a $68.3 million decrease in advertising revenues and a $21.0 million decrease in other revenues. These decreases were partially offset by contributions from acquisitions of $40.2 million in year ended December 31, 2017 and by an increase of $1.2 million in circulation revenues. Overall decreases in circulation volume were generally offset by rate increases.\nCompensation Expense-Compensation expense decreased 8.4%, or $37.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is due primarily to a $24.7 million decrease in accrued incentives, a $18.1 million decrease in salary and payroll tax expense as a result of the reduction in headcount due to current and prior periods personnel restructuring, a $10.3 million decrease in severance costs, and a $9.2 million decrease in health care expense. These decreases were partially offset by compensation expense from acquisitions of $29.0 million.\nNewsprint and Ink Expense-Newsprint and ink expense declined 5.3%, or $3.3 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was due mainly to a 14.1% decline in newsprint consumption due primarily to less advertising space and lower commercial printing revenue, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in the average cost per ton of newsprint. This decrease was partially offset by newsprint and ink expense from acquisitions of $4.6 million.\nOutside Services Expense-Outside services expense decreased 4.5%, or $15.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in circulation and distribution expense of $10.5 million, decreases in legal and consulting expenses of $9.7 million and a decrease in outside printing and production expenses of $5.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by outside service expenses from acquisitions of $7.2 million.\nOther Expenses-Other expenses include occupancy costs, promotion and marketing costs, affiliate fees and other miscellaneous expenses. These expenses decreased 7.6%, or $13.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to decreases in occupancy costs of $8.1 million, promotion and marketing costs of $4.3 million, and $6.7 million in pre-sale shared service costs that were allocated to discontinued operations. These decreases were partially offset by other expenses from acquisitions of $6.1 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense-Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 7.9%, or $4.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the depreciation on prior year fixed asset additions.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense was consistent with the prior year.\nPremium on Stock Buyback-As mentioned above, the Company repurchased shares of the Company's stock for $56.2 million. The fair value of the stock as of the purchase date was $50.2 million. The $6.0 million difference between the purchase price and the transaction date fair value was recorded as a non-operating expense.\nLoss on Equity Investments, net-Loss on equity investments, net was consistent with the prior year.\nOther Income, Net - The increase in other income, net is due to increased credits related to amortization of prior service costs of postretirement plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefits.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)-Income tax expense increased $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year period, primarily due to the additional expense of $11.0 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 mentioned above. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation of the charge.\nThe effective tax rate on pretax income (loss) was (31.8)% and 21.3% in the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2017 as compared with 2016. In the case of a pre-tax loss, the unfavorable permanent differences, such as non-deductible meals and entertainment expense, have the effect of decreasing the tax benefit which, in turn, decreases the effective tax rate.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business as two distinct segments, M and X. The Company measures segment profit using income from operations, which is defined as net income before net interest expense, gain on investment transactions, reorganization items and income taxes. The tables below show the segmentation of income and expenses for the year ended December 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as the year ended December 25, 2016 (in thousands). Fiscal year 2018 is a 52-week year, fiscal year 2017 is a 53-week year and fiscal year 2016 is a 52-week year.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>X\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate and Eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>854,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,030,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,015,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>846,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,076,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>4,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>17,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment\n</td> <td>1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments (1)\n</td> <td>41,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) -

Retail advertising revenues fell 19.5%, or $55.3 million, due to declines in all categories. The categories with the largest declines were department stores, furniture and home furnishings, food and drug stores, specialty merchandise, general merchandise and hardware store categories. National advertising revenues fell 16.5%, or $5.8 million, due to declines in several categories, most notably advertising agencies and wireless categories, partially offset by an increase in the media category. Classified advertising revenues decreased 9.7%, or $5.1 million, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreases in the recruitment category. These decreases were partially offset by the combined impact of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018. Such acquisitions contributed $50.5 million in segment M advertising revenues during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCirculation Revenues-Circulation revenues increased 9.5%, or $30.2 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $58.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $17.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase attributable from the acquisitions is partially offset by a decrease in circulation volume which exceeded increases in rates.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues decreased 6.2%, or $9.6 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to declines of $14.3 million in commercial print and delivery, $4.8 million in direct mail and marketing and $3.7 million in content syndication and other revenues. These decreases were partially offset by revenues from the acquisitions which contributed $18.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $5.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased 6.7%, or $53.5 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to expenses from the acquisitions which contributed $169.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $42.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by decreases in all expense categories.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nAdvertising Revenues-Total advertising and marketing services revenues decreased 13.5%, or $59.4 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Retail advertising revenues fell 16.3%, or $55.3 million, due to declines in all categories. The categories with the largest declines were department stores, furniture and home furnishings, specialty merchandise, food and drug stores, car dealerships and lots and personal services categories. National advertising revenues fell 18.4%, or $8.0 million, due to declines in several categories, most notably media, advertising agencies and wireless categories. Classified advertising revenues decreased 8.3%, or $4.8 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the legal and recruitment categories. These decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 which contributed $8.6 million in segment M advertising revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCirculation Revenues-Circulation revenues increased 4.9%, or $15.0 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $17.2 million in circulation revenue in 2017. The increase attributable from the acquisition is partially offset by a decrease in circulation volume which exceeded increases in rates.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues decreased 7.8%, or $13.1 million, in year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to declines in direct mail and marketing of $7.3 million, content syndication and other revenue of $5.8 million and commercial print and delivery revenues of $5.7 million for third-party publications. These decreases were partially offset by revenues from the New York Daily News which contributed $5.6 million in other revenues the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses decreased 5.5%, or $46.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in all expense categories, partially offset by increased expenses from acquisitions and corporate allocations. The New York Daily News contributed $42.6 million in operating expenses the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSegment X\nSegment X is comprised of the Company's digital revenues and related digital expenses from local websites and mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, TCA and BestReviews.

Classified advertising revenue decreased $51.7 million primarily due to a decrease in the automotive category as a result of the conversion of the Cars.com agreement. Other advertising revenue decreased $2.5 million primarily due to decreases in revenue shares received from advertising partners due to decreased volume. These decreases were partially offset by\ncontributions from acquisitions and an $8.4 million increase in retail advertising revenue primarily due to increases in the car dealerships and lots category partially offset by decreases in the amusements, food and drug stores and hardware stores categories. National advertising revenue remained consistent with prior periods. The combined contribution in segment X advertising revenues of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018 was $21.2 million during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nContent Revenues-Content revenues increased $34.0 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and an increase of $7.3 million in digital subscription revenue. The combined contribution in segment X content revenues of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News, BestReviews in the first quarter of 2018 and The Virginian-Pilot was $26.7 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses decreased 5.6%, or $9.1 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $33.6 million decrease in affiliate fees related to the conversion of the Cars.com agreement and a $7.3 million decrease in bad debt expense. These decreases were partially offset by operating expense from acquisitions. Such acquisitions contributed $37.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nAdvertising Revenues-Total advertising revenues increased 5.0%, or $6.2 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $7.8 million in advertising revenues in 2017, and a $1.9 million increase in other advertising revenue primarily due to increases in revenue shares received from advertising partners due to increased volume. Retail and National advertising revenue remained consistent year over year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in classified advertising revenue, which decreased $5.0 million, primarily due to decreases in the real estate and recruitment categories.\nContent Revenues-Content revenues decreased 3.4%, or $1.2 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in content syndication of $5.5 million partially offset by increases in digital subscription revenue of $3.4 million and contributions from the acquisition of the New York Daily News of $1.0 million.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased 3.9%, or $6.1 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $5.5 million in operating expenses in 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes that its working capital and future cash from operations will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future. The Company's access to, and the availability of, financing in the future will be impacted by many factors, including its credit rating, the liquidity of the overall capital markets, the current state of the economy and other risks described in Part 1, Item 1A of this report. There can be no assurances that the Company will have access to capital markets on acceptable terms.\nSources and Uses\nThe Company expects to fund capital expenditures, pension payments and other operating requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations and investments. The Company's financial and operating performance remains subject to prevailing economic and industry conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company and, despite the Company's current liquidity position, no assurances can be made that cash flows from operations and investments, or dispositions of assets or operations will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's future liquidity needs.\nThe table below summarizes the total operating, investing and financing activity cash flows from continuing operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128,210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,175\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(359,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash attributable to continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(436,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,844\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,785\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flow generated by operating activities is the Company's primary source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2018, an increase of $11.2 million from $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher working capital contributions partially offset by a decrease in operating results and higher pension contributions. Net cash provided by operating activities was $39.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $39.2 million from $0.6 million in the year ended December 25, 2016. The increase was primarily higher working capital contributions.\nNet cash used for investing activities totaled $128.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, and included $53.2 million used for capital expenditures and $70.9 million used for acquisitions. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $23.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 and included $23.5 million used for capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $17.7 million in the year ended December 25, 2016 primarily due to $10.7 million used for capital expenditures and $4.4 million used for acquisitions. We anticipate that capital expenditures for the year ended December 30, 2019 will be approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million.\nNet cash used for financing activities totaled $359.4 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to $353.3 million used for principal payments on senior debt after the sale of the California Properties. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $83.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to $56.2 million used for the repurchase of shares of the Company's common stock and $26.4 million used for principal payments on senior debt. In the year ended December 25, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $86.3 million primarily due to $113.3 million provided by the private placements of 9.9 million shares of the Company's stock, partially offset by $21.1 million used for principal payments on senior debt.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations totaled $392.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to net proceeds of $497.7 million from the sale of the California Properties and forsalebyowner.com partially offset by $96.7 million of federal tax payments. In the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, net cash provided by discontinued operations totaled $56.3 million and $71.6 million, respectively, primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of the Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune.\nStock Repurchases\nOn March 23, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with investment funds associated with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ( Oaktree\u201d), pursuant to which the Company acquired 3,745,947 shares of the Company's common stock for $15.00 per share or a total purchase price of $56.2 million. See Note 18 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the stock repurchase.\nOn March 13, 2019, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company may purchase up to $25.0 million of its outstanding common stock over the next 24 months. The purchases may be made in open-market transactions or privately negotiated transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume, cash needs and other business factors.\nPrivate Placements\nOn February 3, 2016 and June 1, 2016, the Company completed a $44.4 million and a $70.5 million private placement, pursuant to which the Company sold 5,220,000 shares and 4,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $8.50 per share and $15.00 per share, respectively.

Refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information related to the Company's Term Loan Credit Agreement, Senior Term Facility, ABL Credit Agreement, Senior ABL Facility and Letter of Credit Agreement.\nEmployee Reductions\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2018, the Company implemented reductions in staffing levels in its operations of 840 positions for which the Company recorded pretax charges totaling $45.8 million. These reductions include 190\npositions identified in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a voluntary severance incentive plan; 178 positions identified during the third quarter of 2018, of which approximately 50% were at the New York Daily News; 70 positions related to the New York Daily News truck drivers' union and 38 positions related to the Chicago Tribune truck drivers' union.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company offered a Voluntary Severance Incentive Plan ( VSIP\u201d) which provides enhanced separation benefits to eligible employees with more than 10 years of service. The Company plans to fund the VSIP ratably over the payout period through salary continuation that started in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continues through the fourth quarter 2019.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018 the truck drivers' union of the New York Daily News ratified a new collective bargaining agreement with the Company that extended the existing agreement from 2021 to 2024 and relinquished to NYDN the right of delivery of the remaining 60 single copy routes in New York City. The agreement allows for the separation of a total of 80 drivers. The remaining 10 drivers' separations will occur later in the term of the contract. In addition, the Company received other rights and reductions, including reduced dock manning, a move to bi-weekly payroll and a move to Company-provided medical benefits. The Company expects to achieve savings derived from driver salaries, overtime, collection pay, medical contributions to the union welfare plan, worker's compensation, fleet expenses, insurance and other expenses, net of the third-party cost of single copy newspaper delivery.

As a result, the Company agreed to certain changes to the union multiemployer pension plan as well as the proposed merger of such plan. See Note 14 for additional information related to the multiemployer pension plan changes. The Company expects to achieve savings derived from driver salaries, overtime, collection pay, worker's compensation, fleet expenses, insurance and other expenses, net of the third-party cost of newspaper delivery. The Company plans to fund the severance over the payout period through salary continuation that started in the first quarter of 2019 and continues through the fourth quarter 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company implemented reductions in staffing levels in its operations of 484 positions for which the Company recorded pretax charges related to these reductions totaling $18.0 million. These reductions include 112 positions related to the outsourcing to a third party of the printing, packaging and delivery of the Orlando Sentinel.

The contractual obligations table does not include actuarially projected minimum funding requirements of the NYDN Pension Plan after 2019. The projected minimum funding requirements contain significant uncertainties regarding the actuarial assumptions involved in making such minimum funding projections, including interest rate levels, asset returns, mortality and cost trends, and what, if any, changes will occur to regulatory requirements. Further contributions are currently projected for 2019 through 20125, however the amounts\ncannot be reasonably estimated. With respect to additional contributions to the Drivers' Plan and contributions to other multiemployer plans, the Company's funding obligation will be subject to changed based on a number of factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining within the unions, actual returns on plan assets as compared to assumed returns, actions taken by trustees who manage the plan, changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the rate used for discounting future benefit obligations, as well as changes in legislation or regulations impacting funding and payment obligations. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's multiemployer pension plans.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies conform with U.S. GAAP and reflect practices appropriate to Tribune's businesses. The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto. The Company bases its estimates on past experience and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates its policies, estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue Recognition-Tribune's primary sources of revenue are from the sales of advertising space in published issues of its newspapers and other publications and on websites owned by, or affiliated with, Tribune; distribution of preprinted advertising inserts; sales of newspapers, digital subscriptions and other publications to distributors and individual subscribers; the provision of commercial printing and delivery services to third parties, primarily other newspaper companies; and ecommerce referral fee revenue. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. Revenues are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied either at a point in time, such as when an advertisement is published or referral fee revenue is earned, or over time, such as for content licensing. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional revenue recognition disclosures.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets-Goodwill and other intangible assets are summarized in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include only newspaper mastheads, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. The Company has determined that the reporting units at which goodwill will be evaluated are the eight newspaper media groups, TCA, BestReviews and the aggregate of the Company's other digital businesses.\nThe Company's annual impairment review measurement date is in the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year. The estimated fair value of goodwill is determined using many critical factors, including projected future operating cash flows, revenue and market growth, market multiples, discount rates and consideration of market valuations of comparable companies. The estimated fair values of other intangible assets subject to the annual impairment review are calculated based on projected future discounted cash flow analysis. The development of estimated fair values requires the use of assumptions, including assumptions regarding revenue and market growth as well as specific economic factors in the publishing industry such as operating margins and royalty rates for newspaper mastheads. These assumptions reflect Tribune's best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of Tribune's control.\nImpairment Review of Long-Lived Assets-Tribune evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group may be impaired. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group may be impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the asset or asset group over its remaining depreciable life are less than its current carrying value.\nPension Plans-With the acquisition of the New York Daily News, the Company became the sponsor of a single-employer pension plan (the NYDN Pension Plan\u201d). The Company follows accounting guidance under ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits\u201d for single employer defined benefit plans. Plan assets and the projected benefit obligation are measured each December 31, and the Company records as an asset or liability the net funded or underfunded position of the plans. Certain changes in actuarial valuations related to returns on plan assets and projected benefit obligations are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) and are amortized to net periodic pension expense over the weighted average remaining life of plan participants. Net periodic pension expense is recognized each period by accruing interest expense on the projected benefit obligation and accruing a return on assets associated with the plan assets.\nOther Postretirement Benefits-Tribune provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired Tribune employees through postretirement benefit plans. The expected cost of providing these benefits is accrued over the years that the employees render services. It is the Company's policy to fund postretirement benefits as claims are incurred.\nThe Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. The amounts included within these Consolidated Financial Statements were actuarially determined based on amounts for eligible Tribune employees.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans-Contributions made to union-sponsored plans are based upon collective bargaining agreements and are accounted for under guidance related to multiemployer plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards issued and/or adopted in the year ended December 30, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA-The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, income taxes, loss on early debt extinguishment, interest expense, other (expense) income, realized gain (loss) on investments, reorganization items, depreciation and amortization, impairment, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, and other items that the Company does not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, certain other charges and gains that the Company does not believe reflects the underlying business performance as detailed below.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.7%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,576\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium on stock buyback\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on equity investments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,535\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reorganization items, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,897\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and transaction costs (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation settlement (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee voluntary separation program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) -\n</td> <td>Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2017-07, which requires certain components of net benefit costs to be presented outside of income from operations.

Management believes that because Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and gain/loss on equity investments) and (ii) expenses that are not reflective of the Company's core operating results over time (such as restructuring costs, including the employee voluntary separation program and gain/losses on employee benefit plan terminations, litigation or dispute settlement charges or gains, premiums on stock buybacks and transaction-related costs), this measure provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company's financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance; (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods; and (c) in communications with the Company's Board of Directors concerning the Company's financial performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, or a similarly calculated measure, has been used as the basis for certain financial maintenance covenants that the Company was subject to in connection with certain credit facilities. Since not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any\nmeasure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, management believes Adjusted EBITDA should be used to supplement the Company's financial measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP to provide a more complete understanding of the trends affecting the business.\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>they do not reflect the Company's interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company's debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and other factors described throughout this Form 10-K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. - Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe believe that the assumptions underlying the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report are reasonable.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on changes in operations during fiscal year 2018. The Company expects to continue to take actions deemed appropriate to enhance profitability but does not currently know whether or when any such actions will occur or the potential costs and expected savings. Depending on the actions taken and the timing of any such actions, the anticipated cost savings could be recognized in fiscal periods that do not correspond to the fiscal period(s) in which the charges are recognized. As a result, the Company's net income trends could be impacted and more difficult to predict.\n2018 Highlights and Recent Events\n \u2022 On January 29, 2018, the Company and Cars.com, LLC agreed to convert the Company's affiliate markets into Cars.com's direct retail channel. \n \u2022 On February 6, 2018, the Company acquired a 60% membership interest in BestReviews LLC ( BestReviews\u201d), a company engaged in the business of testing, researching and reviewing consumer products.

December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the combined impact of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017, BestReviews in the first quarter of 2018 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018. Such acquisitions contributed $175.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $40.2 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was partially offset by a $111.9 million decrease in advertising revenue, $3.4 million decrease in circulation revenue and a $4.7 million decrease in other revenue.

This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $17.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to the increase related to the acquisitions, the Company experienced a 23.1% increase in average cost per ton of newsprint, related to a proposed tariff on certain newsprint products sourced from Canada. These increases were partially offset by a 13.4% decrease in consumption.\nOutside Services Expense-Outside services expense increased 5.3%, or $17.6 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $35.9 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $7.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as expense related to the Consulting Agreement described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases were partially offset by decreases in circulation and distribution expenses of $15.8 million, outsourced services of $2.9 million and outside printing and production expenses of $1.9 million.\nOther Expenses-Other expenses include occupancy costs, promotion and marketing costs, affiliate fees and other miscellaneous expenses. These expenses increased 0.7%, or $1.2 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $48.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was partially offset by a $33.1 million decrease in affiliate fees related to the conversion of the Cars.com agreement and a $7.7 million decrease in bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense-Depreciation and amortization expense increased 12.6%, or $6.0 million, for the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $6.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nImpairment Expense-In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.9 million related to the goodwill associated with the Sun Sentinel Media Group.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense decreased as the Senior Term Facility was repaid in full in June 2018. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt repayment.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt-In June 2018, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance under the Senior Term Facility and terminated the agreement. As a result of the early extinguishment of debt, the Company incurred a $7.7 million loss to expense the remaining balance of original issue discount and debt origination fees. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt repayment.\nPremium on Stock Buyback-On March 23, 2017, the Company repurchased 3,745,947 shares of the Company's stock for $56.2 million, or $15 per common share. The fair value of the stock as of the purchase date was $50.2 million, or $13.39 per common share. The $6.0 million difference between the purchase price and the transaction date fair value was recorded as a a non-operating expense. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLoss on Equity Investments, Net-Loss on equity investments, net was consistent with the prior year.\nOther Income, Net - The increase in other income, net is primarily due to increased credits related to early termination of certain postretirement benefit plans.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the standard change and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefits.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)-Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $19.9 million for the year ended December 30, 2018, over the prior year period primarily due to prior year tax law changes and lower taxable income. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The effects of the changes in tax rates are required to be recognized in the period enacted and as a result, the Company recorded $10.8 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The Company has recorded an additional $0.2 million of expense in the third quarter of 2018, to bring the total expense to $11.0 million. The additional provision resulted from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation of the tax law change.\nThe effective tax rate on pretax income was 24.2% and (31.8)% in the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nOperating Revenues-Operating revenues decreased 4.5%, or $47.9 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period due to a $68.3 million decrease in advertising revenues and a $21.0 million decrease in other revenues. These decreases were partially offset by contributions from acquisitions of $40.2 million in year ended December 31, 2017 and by an increase of $1.2 million in circulation revenues. Overall decreases in circulation volume were generally offset by rate increases.\nCompensation Expense-Compensation expense decreased 8.4%, or $37.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is due primarily to a $24.7 million decrease in accrued incentives, a $18.1 million decrease in salary and payroll tax expense as a result of the reduction in headcount due to current and prior periods personnel restructuring, a $10.3 million decrease in severance costs, and a $9.2 million decrease in health care expense. These decreases were partially offset by compensation expense from acquisitions of $29.0 million.\nNewsprint and Ink Expense-Newsprint and ink expense declined 5.3%, or $3.3 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was due mainly to a 14.1% decline in newsprint consumption due primarily to less advertising space and lower commercial printing revenue, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in the average cost per ton of newsprint. This decrease was partially offset by newsprint and ink expense from acquisitions of $4.6 million.\nOutside Services Expense-Outside services expense decreased 4.5%, or $15.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in circulation and distribution expense of $10.5 million, decreases in legal and consulting expenses of $9.7 million and a decrease in outside printing and production expenses of $5.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by outside service expenses from acquisitions of $7.2 million.\nOther Expenses-Other expenses include occupancy costs, promotion and marketing costs, affiliate fees and other miscellaneous expenses. These expenses decreased 7.6%, or $13.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to decreases in occupancy costs of $8.1 million, promotion and marketing costs of $4.3 million, and $6.7 million in pre-sale shared service costs that were allocated to discontinued operations. These decreases were partially offset by other expenses from acquisitions of $6.1 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense-Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 7.9%, or $4.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the depreciation on prior year fixed asset additions.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense was consistent with the prior year.\nPremium on Stock Buyback-As mentioned above, the Company repurchased shares of the Company's stock for $56.2 million. The fair value of the stock as of the purchase date was $50.2 million. The $6.0 million difference between the purchase price and the transaction date fair value was recorded as a non-operating expense.\nLoss on Equity Investments, net-Loss on equity investments, net was consistent with the prior year.\nOther Income, Net - The increase in other income, net is due to increased credits related to amortization of prior service costs of postretirement plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefits.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)-Income tax expense increased $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year period, primarily due to the additional expense of $11.0 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 mentioned above. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation of the charge.\nThe effective tax rate on pretax income (loss) was (31.8)% and 21.3% in the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2017 as compared with 2016. In the case of a pre-tax loss, the unfavorable permanent differences, such as non-deductible meals and entertainment expense, have the effect of decreasing the tax benefit which, in turn, decreases the effective tax rate.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business as two distinct segments, M and X. The Company measures segment profit using income from operations, which is defined as net income before net interest expense, gain on investment transactions, reorganization items and income taxes. The tables below show the segmentation of income and expenses for the year ended December 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as the year ended December 25, 2016 (in thousands).

Retail advertising revenues fell 19.5%, or $55.3 million, due to declines in all categories. The categories with the largest declines were department stores, furniture and home furnishings, food and drug stores, specialty merchandise, general merchandise and hardware store categories. National advertising revenues fell 16.5%, or $5.8 million, due to declines in several categories, most notably advertising agencies and wireless categories, partially offset by an increase in the media category. Classified advertising revenues decreased 9.7%, or $5.1 million, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreases in the recruitment category. These decreases were partially offset by the combined impact of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018. Such acquisitions contributed $50.5 million in segment M advertising revenues during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCirculation Revenues-Circulation revenues increased 9.5%, or $30.2 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $58.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $17.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase attributable from the acquisitions is partially offset by a decrease in circulation volume which exceeded increases in rates.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues decreased 6.2%, or $9.6 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to declines of $14.3 million in commercial print and delivery, $4.8 million in direct mail and marketing and $3.7 million in content syndication and other revenues. These decreases were partially offset by revenues from the acquisitions which contributed $18.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $5.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased 6.7%, or $53.5 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to expenses from the acquisitions which contributed $169.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $42.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by decreases in all expense categories.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nAdvertising Revenues-Total advertising and marketing services revenues decreased 13.5%, or $59.4 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Retail advertising revenues fell 16.3%, or $55.3 million, due to declines in all categories. The categories with the largest declines were department stores, furniture and home furnishings, specialty merchandise, food and drug stores, car dealerships and lots and personal services categories. National advertising revenues fell 18.4%, or $8.0 million, due to declines in several categories, most notably media, advertising agencies and wireless categories. Classified advertising revenues decreased 8.3%, or $4.8 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the legal and recruitment categories. These decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 which contributed $8.6 million in segment M advertising revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCirculation Revenues-Circulation revenues increased 4.9%, or $15.0 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $17.2 million in circulation revenue in 2017. The increase attributable from the acquisition is partially offset by a decrease in circulation volume which exceeded increases in rates.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues decreased 7.8%, or $13.1 million, in year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to declines in direct mail and marketing of $7.3 million, content syndication and other revenue of $5.8 million and commercial print and delivery revenues of $5.7 million for third-party publications. These decreases were partially offset by revenues from the New York Daily News which contributed $5.6 million in other revenues the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses decreased 5.5%, or $46.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in all expense categories, partially offset by increased expenses from acquisitions and corporate allocations.

Classified advertising revenue decreased $51.7 million primarily due to a decrease in the automotive category as a result of the conversion of the Cars.com agreement. Other advertising revenue decreased $2.5 million primarily due to decreases in revenue shares received from advertising partners due to decreased volume. These decreases were partially offset by\ncontributions from acquisitions and an $8.4 million increase in retail advertising revenue primarily due to increases in the car dealerships and lots category partially offset by decreases in the amusements, food and drug stores and hardware stores categories. National advertising revenue remained consistent with prior periods. The combined contribution in segment X advertising revenues of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018 was $21.2 million during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nContent Revenues-Content revenues increased $34.0 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and an increase of $7.3 million in digital subscription revenue. The combined contribution in segment X content revenues of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News, BestReviews in the first quarter of 2018 and The Virginian-Pilot was $26.7 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses decreased 5.6%, or $9.1 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $33.6 million decrease in affiliate fees related to the conversion of the Cars.com agreement and a $7.3 million decrease in bad debt expense. These decreases were partially offset by operating expense from acquisitions. Such acquisitions contributed $37.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nAdvertising Revenues-Total advertising revenues increased 5.0%, or $6.2 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $7.8 million in advertising revenues in 2017, and a $1.9 million increase in other advertising revenue primarily due to increases in revenue shares received from advertising partners due to increased volume. Retail and National advertising revenue remained consistent year over year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in classified advertising revenue, which decreased $5.0 million, primarily due to decreases in the real estate and recruitment categories.\nContent Revenues-Content revenues decreased 3.4%, or $1.2 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in content syndication of $5.5 million partially offset by increases in digital subscription revenue of $3.4 million and contributions from the acquisition of the New York Daily News of $1.0 million.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased 3.9%, or $6.1 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $5.5 million in operating expenses in 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes that its working capital and future cash from operations will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future. The Company's access to, and the availability of, financing in the future will be impacted by many factors, including its credit rating, the liquidity of the overall capital markets, the current state of the economy and other risks described in Part 1, Item 1A of this report. There can be no assurances that the Company will have access to capital markets on acceptable terms.\nSources and Uses\nThe Company expects to fund capital expenditures, pension payments and other operating requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations and investments. The Company's financial and operating performance remains subject to prevailing economic and industry conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company and, despite the Company's current liquidity position, no assurances can be made that cash flows from operations and investments, or dispositions of assets or operations will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's future liquidity needs.\nThe table below summarizes the total operating, investing and financing activity cash flows from continuing operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128,210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,175\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(359,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash attributable to continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(436,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,844\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,785\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flow generated by operating activities is the Company's primary source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2018, an increase of $11.2 million from $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher working capital contributions partially offset by a decrease in operating results and higher pension contributions. Net cash provided by operating activities was $39.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $39.2 million from $0.6 million in the year ended December 25, 2016. The increase was primarily higher working capital contributions.\nNet cash used for investing activities totaled $128.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, and included $53.2 million used for capital expenditures and $70.9 million used for acquisitions. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $23.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 and included $23.5 million used for capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $17.7 million in the year ended December 25, 2016 primarily due to $10.7 million used for capital expenditures and $4.4 million used for acquisitions. We anticipate that capital expenditures for the year ended December 30, 2019 will be approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million.\nNet cash used for financing activities totaled $359.4 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to $353.3 million used for principal payments on senior debt after the sale of the California Properties. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $83.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to $56.2 million used for the repurchase of shares of the Company's common stock and $26.4 million used for principal payments on senior debt. In the year ended December 25, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $86.3 million primarily due to $113.3 million provided by the private placements of 9.9 million shares of the Company's stock, partially offset by $21.1 million used for principal payments on senior debt.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations totaled $392.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to net proceeds of $497.7 million from the sale of the California Properties and forsalebyowner.com partially offset by $96.7 million of federal tax payments. In the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, net cash provided by discontinued operations totaled $56.3 million and $71.6 million, respectively, primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of the Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune.\nStock Repurchases\nOn March 23, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with investment funds associated with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ( Oaktree\u201d), pursuant to which the Company acquired 3,745,947 shares of the Company's common stock for $15.00 per share or a total purchase price of $56.2 million. See Note 18 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the stock repurchase.\nOn March 13, 2019, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company may purchase up to $25.0 million of its outstanding common stock over the next 24 months. The purchases may be made in open-market transactions or privately negotiated transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume, cash needs and other business factors.\nPrivate Placements\nOn February 3, 2016 and June 1, 2016, the Company completed a $44.4 million and a $70.5 million private placement, pursuant to which the Company sold 5,220,000 shares and 4,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $8.50 per share and $15.00 per share, respectively.

Refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information related to the Company's Term Loan Credit Agreement, Senior Term Facility, ABL Credit Agreement, Senior ABL Facility and Letter of Credit Agreement.\nEmployee Reductions\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2018, the Company implemented reductions in staffing levels in its operations of 840 positions for which the Company recorded pretax charges totaling $45.8 million. These reductions include 190\npositions identified in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a voluntary severance incentive plan; 178 positions identified during the third quarter of 2018, of which approximately 50% were at the New York Daily News; 70 positions related to the New York Daily News truck drivers' union and 38 positions related to the Chicago Tribune truck drivers' union.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company offered a Voluntary Severance Incentive Plan ( VSIP\u201d) which provides enhanced separation benefits to eligible employees with more than 10 years of service. The Company plans to fund the VSIP ratably over the payout period through salary continuation that started in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continues through the fourth quarter 2019.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018 the truck drivers' union of the New York Daily News ratified a new collective bargaining agreement with the Company that extended the existing agreement from 2021 to 2024 and relinquished to NYDN the right of delivery of the remaining 60 single copy routes in New York City. The agreement allows for the separation of a total of 80 drivers. The remaining 10 drivers' separations will occur later in the term of the contract. In addition, the Company received other rights and reductions, including reduced dock manning, a move to bi-weekly payroll and a move to Company-provided medical benefits. The Company expects to achieve savings derived from driver salaries, overtime, collection pay, medical contributions to the union welfare plan, worker's compensation, fleet expenses, insurance and other expenses, net of the third-party cost of single copy newspaper delivery.

As a result, the Company agreed to certain changes to the union multiemployer pension plan as well as the proposed merger of such plan. See Note 14 for additional information related to the multiemployer pension plan changes. The Company expects to achieve savings derived from driver salaries, overtime, collection pay, worker's compensation, fleet expenses, insurance and other expenses, net of the third-party cost of newspaper delivery. The Company plans to fund the severance over the payout period through salary continuation that started in the first quarter of 2019 and continues through the fourth quarter 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company implemented reductions in staffing levels in its operations of 484 positions for which the Company recorded pretax charges related to these reductions totaling $18.0 million. These reductions include 112 positions related to the outsourcing to a third party of the printing, packaging and delivery of the Orlando Sentinel. The related salary continuation payments began in the third quarter of 2017 and continued through the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, these reductions include 86 positions identified at the New York Daily News. The related salary continuation payments began in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continued through the third quarter of 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below represents Tribune's contractual obligations as of December 30, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term capital lease\n</td> <td>7,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>173,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pensions\n</td> <td>70,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The Company leases certain equipment and office and production space under various operating leases. Net lease expense for Tribune was $32.8 million, $33.5 million and $40.15 million for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, respectively.  The contractual obligations table includes the Company's estimated minimum contribution to the NYDN Pension Plan for 2019 and the Company's minimum contributions to the Chicago Newspaper Publishers Drivers' Union Pension Plan (the Drivers' Plan) for 2019 through 2026 pursuant to a rehabilitation plan and merger agreement adopted by the Drivers' Plan in 2018, as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The contractual obligations table does not include actuarially projected minimum funding requirements of the NYDN Pension Plan after 2019. The projected minimum funding requirements contain significant uncertainties regarding the actuarial assumptions involved in making such minimum funding projections, including interest rate levels, asset returns, mortality and cost trends, and what, if any, changes will occur to regulatory requirements. Further contributions are currently projected for 2019 through 20125, however the amounts\ncannot be reasonably estimated. With respect to additional contributions to the Drivers' Plan and contributions to other multiemployer plans, the Company's funding obligation will be subject to changed based on a number of factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining within the unions, actual returns on plan assets as compared to assumed returns, actions taken by trustees who manage the plan, changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the rate used for discounting future benefit obligations, as well as changes in legislation or regulations impacting funding and payment obligations. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's multiemployer pension plans.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies conform with U.S. GAAP and reflect practices appropriate to Tribune's businesses. The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto. The Company bases its estimates on past experience and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates its policies, estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue Recognition-Tribune's primary sources of revenue are from the sales of advertising space in published issues of its newspapers and other publications and on websites owned by, or affiliated with, Tribune; distribution of preprinted advertising inserts; sales of newspapers, digital subscriptions and other publications to distributors and individual subscribers; the provision of commercial printing and delivery services to third parties, primarily other newspaper companies; and ecommerce referral fee revenue. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. Revenues are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied either at a point in time, such as when an advertisement is published or referral fee revenue is earned, or over time, such as for content licensing. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional revenue recognition disclosures.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets-Goodwill and other intangible assets are summarized in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include only newspaper mastheads, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. The Company has determined that the reporting units at which goodwill will be evaluated are the eight newspaper media groups, TCA, BestReviews and the aggregate of the Company's other digital businesses.\nThe Company's annual impairment review measurement date is in the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year. The estimated fair value of goodwill is determined using many critical factors, including projected future operating cash flows, revenue and market growth, market multiples, discount rates and consideration of market valuations of comparable companies. The estimated fair values of other intangible assets subject to the annual impairment review are calculated based on projected future discounted cash flow analysis. The development of estimated fair values requires the use of assumptions, including assumptions regarding revenue and market growth as well as specific economic factors in the publishing industry such as operating margins and royalty rates for newspaper mastheads. These assumptions reflect Tribune's best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of Tribune's control.\nImpairment Review of Long-Lived Assets-Tribune evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group may be impaired. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group may be impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the asset or asset group over its remaining depreciable life are less than its current carrying value.\nPension Plans-With the acquisition of the New York Daily News, the Company became the sponsor of a single-employer pension plan (the NYDN Pension Plan\u201d). The Company follows accounting guidance under ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits\u201d for single employer defined benefit plans. Plan assets and the projected benefit obligation are measured each December 31, and the Company records as an asset or liability the net funded or underfunded position of the plans. Certain changes in actuarial valuations related to returns on plan assets and projected benefit obligations are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) and are amortized to net periodic pension expense over the weighted average remaining life of plan participants. Net periodic pension expense is recognized each period by accruing interest expense on the projected benefit obligation and accruing a return on assets associated with the plan assets.\nOther Postretirement Benefits-Tribune provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired Tribune employees through postretirement benefit plans. The expected cost of providing these benefits is accrued over the years that the employees render services. It is the Company's policy to fund postretirement benefits as claims are incurred.\nThe Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. The amounts included within these Consolidated Financial Statements were actuarially determined based on amounts for eligible Tribune employees.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans-Contributions made to union-sponsored plans are based upon collective bargaining agreements and are accounted for under guidance related to multiemployer plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards issued and/or adopted in the year ended December 30, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA-The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, income taxes, loss on early debt extinguishment, interest expense, other (expense) income, realized gain (loss) on investments, reorganization items, depreciation and amortization, impairment, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, and other items that the Company does not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, certain other charges and gains that the Company does not believe reflects the underlying business performance as detailed below.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.7%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,576\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium on stock buyback\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on equity investments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,535\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reorganization items, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,897\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and transaction costs (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation settlement (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee voluntary separation program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\n (1) - Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2017-07, which requires certain components of net benefit costs to be presented outside of income from operations. The standard required retrospective application. Accordingly, amounts presented in the prior period have been adjusted to conform with the standard. \n (2) - Restructuring and transaction costs include costs related to Tribune's internal restructuring, such as severance, charges associated with vacated space, costs related to completed and potential acquisitions and a one-time charge related to the Consulting Agreement. \nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3) -\n</td> <td>Adjustment to litigation settlement reserve.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). Management believes that because Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and gain/loss on equity investments) and (ii) expenses that are not reflective of the Company's core operating results over time (such as restructuring costs, including the employee voluntary separation program and gain/losses on employee benefit plan terminations, litigation or dispute settlement charges or gains, premiums on stock buybacks and transaction-related costs), this measure provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company's financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance; (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods; and (c) in communications with the Company's Board of Directors concerning the Company's financial performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, or a similarly calculated measure, has been used as the basis for certain financial maintenance covenants that the Company was subject to in connection with certain credit facilities. Since not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any\nmeasure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, management believes Adjusted EBITDA should be used to supplement the Company's financial measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP to provide a more complete understanding of the trends affecting the business.\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are:\n \u2022 they do not reflect the Company's interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company's debt; \n \u2022 they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and \n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and other factors described throughout this Form 10-K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. - Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe believe that the assumptions underlying the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report are reasonable. However, the Consolidated Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows for future periods.\nOVERVIEW\nTribune Publishing Company, formerly tronc, Inc., was formed as a Delaware corporation on November 21, 2013.

References in this discussion to individual markets include daily newspapers in those markets and their related businesses.\n\n* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\nYear ended December 30, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nOperating Revenues-Operating revenues increased 1.5%, or $15.2 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the combined impact of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017, BestReviews in the first quarter of 2018 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018. Such acquisitions contributed $175.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $40.2 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was partially offset by a $111.9 million decrease in advertising revenue, $3.4 million decrease in circulation revenue and a $4.7 million decrease in other revenue. The decrease in advertising revenue includes $39.9 million related to the conversion of the Cars.com agreement.\nCompensation Expense-Compensation expense increased 9.1%, or $36.8 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior period. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $98.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $29.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase from acquisitions was partially offset by a decrease in salary expense of $37.6 million as a result of the reduction in headcount due to current and prior periods personnel restructuring.\nNewsprint and Ink Expense-Newsprint and ink expense increased 11.6%, or $6.9 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $17.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to the increase related to the acquisitions, the Company experienced a 23.1% increase in average cost per ton of newsprint, related to a proposed tariff on certain newsprint products sourced from Canada. These increases were partially offset by a 13.4% decrease in consumption.\nOutside Services Expense-Outside services expense increased 5.3%, or $17.6 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $35.9 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $7.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as expense related to the Consulting Agreement described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases were partially offset by decreases in circulation and distribution expenses of $15.8 million, outsourced services of $2.9 million and outside printing and production expenses of $1.9 million.\nOther Expenses-Other expenses include occupancy costs, promotion and marketing costs, affiliate fees and other miscellaneous expenses. These expenses increased 0.7%, or $1.2 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $48.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was partially offset by a $33.1 million decrease in affiliate fees related to the conversion of the Cars.com agreement and a $7.7 million decrease in bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense-Depreciation and amortization expense increased 12.6%, or $6.0 million, for the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $6.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nImpairment Expense-In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.9 million related to the goodwill associated with the Sun Sentinel Media Group.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense decreased as the Senior Term Facility was repaid in full in June 2018. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt repayment.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt-In June 2018, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance under the Senior Term Facility and terminated the agreement. As a result of the early extinguishment of debt, the Company incurred a $7.7 million loss to expense the remaining balance of original issue discount and debt origination fees. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt repayment.\nPremium on Stock Buyback-On March 23, 2017, the Company repurchased 3,745,947 shares of the Company's stock for $56.2 million, or $15 per common share. The fair value of the stock as of the purchase date was $50.2 million, or $13.39 per common share. The $6.0 million difference between the purchase price and the transaction date fair value was recorded as a a non-operating expense. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLoss on Equity Investments, Net-Loss on equity investments, net was consistent with the prior year.\nOther Income, Net - The increase in other income, net is primarily due to increased credits related to early termination of certain postretirement benefit plans. Due to an accounting standard change, credits for amortization of prior service costs related to such plans are reported in Other Income, Net, instead of Compensation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the standard change and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefits.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)-Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $19.9 million for the year ended December 30, 2018, over the prior year period primarily due to prior year tax law changes and lower taxable income. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The effects of the changes in tax rates are required to be recognized in the period enacted and as a result, the Company recorded $10.8 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The Company has recorded an additional $0.2 million of expense in the third quarter of 2018, to bring the total expense to $11.0 million. The additional provision resulted from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation of the tax law change.\nThe effective tax rate on pretax income was 24.2% and (31.8)% in the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nOperating Revenues-Operating revenues decreased 4.5%, or $47.9 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period due to a $68.3 million decrease in advertising revenues and a $21.0 million decrease in other revenues. These decreases were partially offset by contributions from acquisitions of $40.2 million in year ended December 31, 2017 and by an increase of $1.2 million in circulation revenues. Overall decreases in circulation volume were generally offset by rate increases.\nCompensation Expense-Compensation expense decreased 8.4%, or $37.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is due primarily to a $24.7 million decrease in accrued incentives, a $18.1 million decrease in salary and payroll tax expense as a result of the reduction in headcount due to current and prior periods personnel restructuring, a $10.3 million decrease in severance costs, and a $9.2 million decrease in health care expense. These decreases were partially offset by compensation expense from acquisitions of $29.0 million.\nNewsprint and Ink Expense-Newsprint and ink expense declined 5.3%, or $3.3 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was due mainly to a 14.1% decline in newsprint consumption due primarily to less advertising space and lower commercial printing revenue, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in the average cost per ton of newsprint. This decrease was partially offset by newsprint and ink expense from acquisitions of $4.6 million.\nOutside Services Expense-Outside services expense decreased 4.5%, or $15.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in circulation and distribution expense of $10.5 million, decreases in legal and consulting expenses of $9.7 million and a decrease in outside printing and production expenses of $5.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by outside service expenses from acquisitions of $7.2 million.\nOther Expenses-Other expenses include occupancy costs, promotion and marketing costs, affiliate fees and other miscellaneous expenses. These expenses decreased 7.6%, or $13.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to decreases in occupancy costs of $8.1 million, promotion and marketing costs of $4.3 million, and $6.7 million in pre-sale shared service costs that were allocated to discontinued operations. These decreases were partially offset by other expenses from acquisitions of $6.1 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense-Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 7.9%, or $4.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the depreciation on prior year fixed asset additions.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense was consistent with the prior year.\nPremium on Stock Buyback-As mentioned above, the Company repurchased shares of the Company's stock for $56.2 million. The fair value of the stock as of the purchase date was $50.2 million. The $6.0 million difference between the purchase price and the transaction date fair value was recorded as a non-operating expense.\nLoss on Equity Investments, net-Loss on equity investments, net was consistent with the prior year.\nOther Income, Net - The increase in other income, net is due to increased credits related to amortization of prior service costs of postretirement plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefits.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)-Income tax expense increased $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year period, primarily due to the additional expense of $11.0 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 mentioned above. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation of the charge.\nThe effective tax rate on pretax income (loss) was (31.8)% and 21.3% in the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2017 as compared with 2016. In the case of a pre-tax loss, the unfavorable permanent differences, such as non-deductible meals and entertainment expense, have the effect of decreasing the tax benefit which, in turn, decreases the effective tax rate.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business as two distinct segments, M and X. The Company measures segment profit using income from operations, which is defined as net income before net interest expense, gain on investment transactions, reorganization items and income taxes. The tables below show the segmentation of income and expenses for the year ended December 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as the year ended December 25, 2016 (in thousands). Fiscal year 2018 is a 52-week year, fiscal year 2017 is a 53-week year and fiscal year 2016 is a 52-week year.\n\n(1) - See Non-GAAP Measures for additional information on adjustments.\n\n(1) - See Non-GAAP Measures for additional information on adjustments.\nSegment M\nSegment M's media groups include the Chicago Tribune Media Group, the New York Daily News Media Group, the Sun Sentinel Media Group, the Orlando Sentinel Media Group, The Baltimore Sun Media Group, the Hartford Courant Media Group, the Morning Call Media Group, and the Virginia Media Group (which includes the Daily Press and the recently acquired The Virginian-Pilot).\n\n(1) - See Non-GAAP Measures for additional information on adjustments.\n* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\nYear ended December 30, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nAdvertising Revenues-Total advertising and marketing services revenues decreased 6.4%, or $24.4 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year period. Retail advertising revenues fell 19.5%, or $55.3 million, due to declines in all categories. The categories with the largest declines were department stores, furniture and home furnishings, food and drug stores, specialty merchandise, general merchandise and hardware store categories. National advertising revenues fell 16.5%, or $5.8 million, due to declines in several categories, most notably advertising agencies and wireless categories, partially offset by an increase in the media category. Classified advertising revenues decreased 9.7%, or $5.1 million, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreases in the recruitment category. These decreases were partially offset by the combined impact of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018. Such acquisitions contributed $50.5 million in segment M advertising revenues during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCirculation Revenues-Circulation revenues increased 9.5%, or $30.2 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018. This increase was due primarily to the acquisitions which contributed $58.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $17.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase attributable from the acquisitions is partially offset by a decrease in circulation volume which exceeded increases in rates.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues decreased 6.2%, or $9.6 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to declines of $14.3 million in commercial print and delivery, $4.8 million in direct mail and marketing and $3.7 million in content syndication and other revenues. These decreases were partially offset by revenues from the acquisitions which contributed $18.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $5.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased 6.7%, or $53.5 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to expenses from the acquisitions which contributed $169.3 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $42.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by decreases in all expense categories.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nAdvertising Revenues-Total advertising and marketing services revenues decreased 13.5%, or $59.4 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Retail advertising revenues fell 16.3%, or $55.3 million, due to declines in all categories. The categories with the largest declines were department stores, furniture and home furnishings, specialty merchandise, food and drug stores, car dealerships and lots and personal services categories. National advertising revenues fell 18.4%, or $8.0 million, due to declines in several categories, most notably media, advertising agencies and wireless categories. Classified advertising revenues decreased 8.3%, or $4.8 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the legal and recruitment categories. These decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 which contributed $8.6 million in segment M advertising revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCirculation Revenues-Circulation revenues increased 4.9%, or $15.0 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $17.2 million in circulation revenue in 2017. The increase attributable from the acquisition is partially offset by a decrease in circulation volume which exceeded increases in rates.\nOther Revenues-Other revenues decreased 7.8%, or $13.1 million, in year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to declines in direct mail and marketing of $7.3 million, content syndication and other revenue of $5.8 million and commercial print and delivery revenues of $5.7 million for third-party publications. These decreases were partially offset by revenues from the New York Daily News which contributed $5.6 million in other revenues the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses decreased 5.5%, or $46.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in all expense categories, partially offset by increased expenses from acquisitions and corporate allocations. The New York Daily News contributed $42.6 million in operating expenses the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSegment X\nSegment X is comprised of the Company's digital revenues and related digital expenses from local websites and mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, TCA and BestReviews. On January 29, 2018, the Company and Cars.com agreed to convert the Company's affiliated markets into Cars.com's direct retail channel.\n\n(1) - See Non-GAAP Measures for additional information on adjustments.\n* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\nYear ended December 30, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nAdvertising Revenues-Total advertising revenues decreased 24.8%, or $32.4 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018. Classified advertising revenue decreased $51.7 million primarily due to a decrease in the automotive category as a result of the conversion of the Cars.com agreement. Other advertising revenue decreased $2.5 million primarily due to decreases in revenue shares received from advertising partners due to decreased volume. These decreases were partially offset by\ncontributions from acquisitions and an $8.4 million increase in retail advertising revenue primarily due to increases in the car dealerships and lots category partially offset by decreases in the amusements, food and drug stores and hardware stores categories. National advertising revenue remained consistent with prior periods. The combined contribution in segment X advertising revenues of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News in the third quarter of 2017 and The Virginian-Pilot in the second quarter of 2018 was $21.2 million during the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nContent Revenues-Content revenues increased $34.0 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and an increase of $7.3 million in digital subscription revenue. The combined contribution in segment X content revenues of the acquisitions of the New York Daily News, BestReviews in the first quarter of 2018 and The Virginian-Pilot was $26.7 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses decreased 5.6%, or $9.1 million, in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $33.6 million decrease in affiliate fees related to the conversion of the Cars.com agreement and a $7.3 million decrease in bad debt expense. These decreases were partially offset by operating expense from acquisitions. Such acquisitions contributed $37.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018 compared to $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 25, 2016\nAdvertising Revenues-Total advertising revenues increased 5.0%, or $6.2 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $7.8 million in advertising revenues in 2017, and a $1.9 million increase in other advertising revenue primarily due to increases in revenue shares received from advertising partners due to increased volume. Retail and National advertising revenue remained consistent year over year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in classified advertising revenue, which decreased $5.0 million, primarily due to decreases in the real estate and recruitment categories.\nContent Revenues-Content revenues decreased 3.4%, or $1.2 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in content syndication of $5.5 million partially offset by increases in digital subscription revenue of $3.4 million and contributions from the acquisition of the New York Daily News of $1.0 million.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased 3.9%, or $6.1 million, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of the New York Daily News which contributed $5.5 million in operating expenses in 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes that its working capital and future cash from operations will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future. The Company's access to, and the availability of, financing in the future will be impacted by many factors, including its credit rating, the liquidity of the overall capital markets, the current state of the economy and other risks described in Part 1, Item 1A of this report. There can be no assurances that the Company will have access to capital markets on acceptable terms.\nSources and Uses\nThe Company expects to fund capital expenditures, pension payments and other operating requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations and investments. The Company's financial and operating performance remains subject to prevailing economic and industry conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company and, despite the Company's current liquidity position, no assurances can be made that cash flows from operations and investments, or dispositions of assets or operations will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's future liquidity needs.\nThe table below summarizes the total operating, investing and financing activity cash flows from continuing operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nCash flow generated by operating activities is the Company's primary source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities was $51.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2018, an increase of $11.2 million from $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher working capital contributions partially offset by a decrease in operating results and higher pension contributions. Net cash provided by operating activities was $39.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $39.2 million from $0.6 million in the year ended December 25, 2016. The increase was primarily higher working capital contributions.\nNet cash used for investing activities totaled $128.2 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, and included $53.2 million used for capital expenditures and $70.9 million used for acquisitions. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $23.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 and included $23.5 million used for capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $17.7 million in the year ended December 25, 2016 primarily due to $10.7 million used for capital expenditures and $4.4 million used for acquisitions. We anticipate that capital expenditures for the year ended December 30, 2019 will be approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million.\nNet cash used for financing activities totaled $359.4 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to $353.3 million used for principal payments on senior debt after the sale of the California Properties. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $83.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to $56.2 million used for the repurchase of shares of the Company's common stock and $26.4 million used for principal payments on senior debt. In the year ended December 25, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $86.3 million primarily due to $113.3 million provided by the private placements of 9.9 million shares of the Company's stock, partially offset by $21.1 million used for principal payments on senior debt.\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations totaled $392.8 million in the year ended December 30, 2018, primarily due to net proceeds of $497.7 million from the sale of the California Properties and forsalebyowner.com partially offset by $96.7 million of federal tax payments. In the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, net cash provided by discontinued operations totaled $56.3 million and $71.6 million, respectively, primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of the Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune.\nStock Repurchases\nOn March 23, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with investment funds associated with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ( Oaktree\u201d), pursuant to which the Company acquired 3,745,947 shares of the Company's common stock for $15.00 per share or a total purchase price of $56.2 million. See Note 18 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the stock repurchase.\nOn March 13, 2019, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company may purchase up to $25.0 million of its outstanding common stock over the next 24 months. The purchases may be made in open-market transactions or privately negotiated transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume, cash needs and other business factors.\nPrivate Placements\nOn February 3, 2016 and June 1, 2016, the Company completed a $44.4 million and a $70.5 million private placement, pursuant to which the Company sold 5,220,000 shares and 4,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $8.50 per share and $15.00 per share, respectively. See Note 18 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the private placements.\nAcquisitions\nSee Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on acquisitions.\nAcquisitions - 2018\nVirginian-Pilot\nOn May 28, 2018, Tribune Publishing Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Virginian-Pilot Media Companies, LLC ( Virginian-Pilot\u201d), the owner of The Virginian-Pilot daily newspaper based in Norfolk, Virginia, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, entered into on the same date, by and among the Company, Virginian-Pilot and Landmark Media Enterprises, LLC for a cash purchase price of $34.0 million, less a post-closing working capital adjustment of $0.1 million received from the seller.\nBestReviews\nOn February 6, 2018, the Company acquired a 60% membership interest in BestReviews LLC ( BestReviews\u201d), a company engaged in the business of testing, researching and reviewing consumer products, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement, entered into on the same date, among the Company, BestReviews Inc., a Delaware corporation, BestReviews and the stockholders of Best Reviews Inc. for a total purchase price of $68.3 million, consisting of $33.7 million in cash, less a post-closing working capital adjustment received from the seller of $0.6 million, and $34.6 million in common stock of the Company.\nAcquisitions - 2017\nOn September 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the partnership interests in DNLP, the owner of the New York Daily News in New York City, pursuant to the Partnership Interest Purchase Agreement dated September 3, 2017, for a cash purchase price of one dollar and assumption of various liabilities, subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company finalized the working capital calculation which resulted in an immaterial adjustment. During the third quarter of 2018, the final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was completed.\nAcquisitions - 2016\nIn December 2016, the Company completed acquisitions totaling $7.6 million including Spanfeller Media, a digital platform which includes The Daily Meal and The Active Times, and other immaterial properties. The results of the acquisitions and the related transaction costs were not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) since the date of acquisition.\nDebt\nOn June 21, 2018, the Company used a portion of the proceeds received from the Nant Transaction to repay the outstanding principal amount under the Senior Term Facility and to terminate the Senior ABL Facility. Refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information related to the Company's Term Loan Credit Agreement, Senior Term Facility, ABL Credit Agreement, Senior ABL Facility and Letter of Credit Agreement.\nEmployee Reductions\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2018, the Company implemented reductions in staffing levels in its operations of 840 positions for which the Company recorded pretax charges totaling $45.8 million. These reductions include 190\npositions identified in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a voluntary severance incentive plan; 178 positions identified during the third quarter of 2018, of which approximately 50% were at the New York Daily News; 70 positions related to the New York Daily News truck drivers' union and 38 positions related to the Chicago Tribune truck drivers' union.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company offered a Voluntary Severance Incentive Plan ( VSIP\u201d) which provides enhanced separation benefits to eligible employees with more than 10 years of service. The Company plans to fund the VSIP ratably over the payout period through salary continuation that started in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continues through the fourth quarter 2019.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018 the truck drivers' union of the New York Daily News ratified a new collective bargaining agreement with the Company that extended the existing agreement from 2021 to 2024 and relinquished to NYDN the right of delivery of the remaining 60 single copy routes in New York City. The agreement allows for the separation of a total of 80 drivers. The remaining 10 drivers' separations will occur later in the term of the contract. In addition, the Company received other rights and reductions, including reduced dock manning, a move to bi-weekly payroll and a move to Company-provided medical benefits. The Company expects to achieve savings derived from driver salaries, overtime, collection pay, medical contributions to the union welfare plan, worker's compensation, fleet expenses, insurance and other expenses, net of the third-party cost of single copy newspaper delivery. The severance payments were in the form of lump sum payments and were paid in the first quarter of 2019.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the truck drivers' union of the Chicago Tribune ratified a new collective bargaining agreement with the Company that extended the existing agreement to 2021 and allows the Company to reduce the number of union positions. As a result, the Company agreed to certain changes to the union multiemployer pension plan as well as the proposed merger of such plan. See Note 14 for additional information related to the multiemployer pension plan changes. The Company expects to achieve savings derived from driver salaries, overtime, collection pay, worker's compensation, fleet expenses, insurance and other expenses, net of the third-party cost of newspaper delivery. The Company plans to fund the severance over the payout period through salary continuation that started in the first quarter of 2019 and continues through the fourth quarter 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company implemented reductions in staffing levels in its operations of 484 positions for which the Company recorded pretax charges related to these reductions totaling $18.0 million. These reductions include 112 positions related to the outsourcing to a third party of the printing, packaging and delivery of the Orlando Sentinel. The related salary continuation payments began in the third quarter of 2017 and continued through the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, these reductions include 86 positions identified at the New York Daily News. The related salary continuation payments began in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continued through the third quarter of 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below represents Tribune's contractual obligations as of December 30, 2018 (in thousands):\n\n (1) The Company leases certain equipment and office and production space under various operating leases. Net lease expense for Tribune was $32.8 million, $33.5 million and $40.15 million for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, respectively.  The contractual obligations table includes the Company's estimated minimum contribution to the NYDN Pension Plan for 2019 and the Company's minimum contributions to the Chicago Newspaper Publishers Drivers' Union Pension Plan (the Drivers' Plan) for 2019 through 2026 pursuant to a rehabilitation plan and merger agreement adopted by the Drivers' Plan in 2018, as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The contractual obligations table does not include actuarially projected minimum funding requirements of the NYDN Pension Plan after 2019. The projected minimum funding requirements contain significant uncertainties regarding the actuarial assumptions involved in making such minimum funding projections, including interest rate levels, asset returns, mortality and cost trends, and what, if any, changes will occur to regulatory requirements. Further contributions are currently projected for 2019 through 20125, however the amounts\ncannot be reasonably estimated. With respect to additional contributions to the Drivers' Plan and contributions to other multiemployer plans, the Company's funding obligation will be subject to changed based on a number of factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining within the unions, actual returns on plan assets as compared to assumed returns, actions taken by trustees who manage the plan, changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the rate used for discounting future benefit obligations, as well as changes in legislation or regulations impacting funding and payment obligations. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's multiemployer pension plans.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies conform with U.S. GAAP and reflect practices appropriate to Tribune's businesses. The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto. The Company bases its estimates on past experience and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates its policies, estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue Recognition-Tribune's primary sources of revenue are from the sales of advertising space in published issues of its newspapers and other publications and on websites owned by, or affiliated with, Tribune; distribution of preprinted advertising inserts; sales of newspapers, digital subscriptions and other publications to distributors and individual subscribers; the provision of commercial printing and delivery services to third parties, primarily other newspaper companies; and ecommerce referral fee revenue. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. Revenues are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied either at a point in time, such as when an advertisement is published or referral fee revenue is earned, or over time, such as for content licensing. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional revenue recognition disclosures.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets-Goodwill and other intangible assets are summarized in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include only newspaper mastheads, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. The Company has determined that the reporting units at which goodwill will be evaluated are the eight newspaper media groups, TCA, BestReviews and the aggregate of the Company's other digital businesses.\nThe Company's annual impairment review measurement date is in the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year. The estimated fair value of goodwill is determined using many critical factors, including projected future operating cash flows, revenue and market growth, market multiples, discount rates and consideration of market valuations of comparable companies. The estimated fair values of other intangible assets subject to the annual impairment review are calculated based on projected future discounted cash flow analysis. The development of estimated fair values requires the use of assumptions, including assumptions regarding revenue and market growth as well as specific economic factors in the publishing industry such as operating margins and royalty rates for newspaper mastheads. These assumptions reflect Tribune's best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of Tribune's control.\nImpairment Review of Long-Lived Assets-Tribune evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group may be impaired. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group may be impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the asset or asset group over its remaining depreciable life are less than its current carrying value.\nPension Plans-With the acquisition of the New York Daily News, the Company became the sponsor of a single-employer pension plan (the NYDN Pension Plan\u201d). The Company follows accounting guidance under ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits\u201d for single employer defined benefit plans. Plan assets and the projected benefit obligation are measured each December 31, and the Company records as an asset or liability the net funded or underfunded position of the plans. Certain changes in actuarial valuations related to returns on plan assets and projected benefit obligations are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) and are amortized to net periodic pension expense over the weighted average remaining life of plan participants. Net periodic pension expense is recognized each period by accruing interest expense on the projected benefit obligation and accruing a return on assets associated with the plan assets.\nOther Postretirement Benefits-Tribune provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired Tribune employees through postretirement benefit plans. The expected cost of providing these benefits is accrued over the years that the employees render services. It is the Company's policy to fund postretirement benefits as claims are incurred.\nThe Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. The amounts included within these Consolidated Financial Statements were actuarially determined based on amounts for eligible Tribune employees.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans-Contributions made to union-sponsored plans are based upon collective bargaining agreements and are accounted for under guidance related to multiemployer plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards issued and/or adopted in the year ended December 30, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA-The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, income taxes, loss on early debt extinguishment, interest expense, other (expense) income, realized gain (loss) on investments, reorganization items, depreciation and amortization, impairment, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, and other items that the Company does not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, certain other charges and gains that the Company does not believe reflects the underlying business performance as detailed below.\n\n* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100%\n (1) - Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2017-07, which requires certain components of net benefit costs to be presented outside of income from operations. The standard required retrospective application. Accordingly, amounts presented in the prior period have been adjusted to conform with the standard. \n (2) - Restructuring and transaction costs include costs related to Tribune's internal restructuring, such as severance, charges associated with vacated space, costs related to completed and potential acquisitions and a one-time charge related to the Consulting Agreement. \n Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). Management believes that because Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and gain/loss on equity investments) and (ii) expenses that are not reflective of the Company's core operating results over time (such as restructuring costs, including the employee voluntary separation program and gain/losses on employee benefit plan terminations, litigation or dispute settlement charges or gains, premiums on stock buybacks and transaction-related costs), this measure provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company's financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance; (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods; and (c) in communications with the Company's Board of Directors concerning the Company's financial performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, or a similarly calculated measure, has been used as the basis for certain financial maintenance covenants that the Company was subject to in connection with certain credit facilities. Since not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any\nmeasure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, management believes Adjusted EBITDA should be used to supplement the Company's financial measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP to provide a more complete understanding of the trends affecting the business.\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are:\n \u2022 they do not reflect the Company's interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company's debt; \n \u2022 they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and \n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Tribune Publishing Company operates local media businesses including newspapers and websites in 8 markets under brands like Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News. \n- In 2018, revenues were $1.03 billion, up 1.5% due to acquisitions. Net income was $249.6 million including a $289.5 million gain on sale of discontinued operations.\n\nResults of Operations\n- 2018 operating expenses increased 7% to $1.08 billion due to acquisitions, while advertising and circulation revenues declined. A loss of $46.2 million from operations was recorded versus income of $8.9 million in 2017.\n- Net loss from continuing operations was $39.9 million compared to $29.8 million loss in 2017. Discontinued operations had earnings of $289.5 million.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Operating cash flow was $51 million in 2018. Investing activities used $128 million primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Financing activities used $359 million to repay debt.  \n- The company completed several acquisitions in 2018 including BestReviews and Virginian-Pilot.\n\nOutlook\n- Workforce reductions in 2018 are expected to achieve cost savings going forward. Additional reductions may occur to improve profitability.\n- Capital expenditures for 2019 are estimated to be $20-25 million.\n\nSo in summary, Tribune's revenue increased in 2018 due to acquisitions but underlying advertising revenues declined. The company took actions to reduce costs but still reported a net loss from continuing operations. Significant earnings from sale of discontinued operations drove overall net income."}
