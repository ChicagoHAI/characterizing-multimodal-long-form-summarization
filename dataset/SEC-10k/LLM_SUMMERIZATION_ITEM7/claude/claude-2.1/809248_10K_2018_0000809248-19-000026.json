MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur fiscal years consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 each contained 52 weeks.\nIntroduction\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, Carrols, Carrols LLC and Republic Foods, Inc., and have no assets other than the shares of capital stock of Carrols, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary. The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d ( MD&A\u201d) is written to help the reader understand our company. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying consolidated financial statement footnotes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A, which include the following:\nCompany Overview-a general description of our business and our key financial measures.\nRecent and Future Events Affecting Our Results of Operations-a description of recent events that affect, and future events that may affect, our results of operations.\nResults of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 including a review of the material items and known trends and uncertainties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of our cash flows, including capital expenditures, changes in capital resources and known trends that may impact liquidity.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies-an overview of accounting policies requiring critical judgments and estimates.\nNew accounting pronouncements - a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation, and the impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations, if any.\nCompany Overview\nWe are one of the largest restaurant companies in the United States and have been operating restaurants for more than 55 years. We are the largest Burger King\u00ae franchisee in the United States, based on number of restaurants, and have operated Burger King restaurants since 1976. As of December 30, 2018, our restaurant operations consisted of 849 franchised Burger King restaurants in 18 states.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2018, we acquired 44 restaurants in four separate transactions which we refer to as the \"2018 acquired restaurants\". During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 64 restaurants in three separate transactions, which we refer to as the \"2017 acquired restaurants,\" and during the year ended January 1, 2017, we acquired 56 Burger King\u00ae restaurants in seven separate transactions.\nThe following is an overview of the key financial measures discussed in our results of operations:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restaurant sales consist of food and beverage sales at our restaurants, net of discounts and excluding sales tax collected. Restaurant sales are influenced by changes in comparable restaurant sales, menu price increases, new restaurant development, acquisition of restaurants, and the closures of restaurants. Restaurants, including restaurants we acquire, are included in comparable restaurant sales after they have been open or owned for 12 months and immediately after they open from being remodeled. For comparative purposes, where applicable, the calculation of the changes in comparable restaurant sales is based either on a 53-week or 52-week year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of sales consists of food, paper and beverage costs including packaging costs, less purchase discounts. Cost of sales is generally influenced by changes in commodity costs, the mix of items sold and the level of promotional discounting and the effectiveness of our restaurant-level controls to manage food and paper costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restaurant wages and related expenses include all restaurant management and hourly productive labor costs and related benefits, employer payroll taxes and restaurant-level bonuses. Payroll and related benefits are subject to inflation, including minimum wage increases and increased costs for health insurance, workers' compensation insurance and federal and state unemployment insurance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restaurant rent expense includes base rent and contingent rent on our leases characterized as operating leases and the amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, reduced by the amortization of deferred gains on sale-leaseback transactions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other restaurant operating expenses include all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are royalty expenses paid to BKC, utilities, repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and credit card fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Advertising expense includes advertising payments to BKC based on a percentage of sales as required under our franchise and operating agreements and additional marketing and promotional expenses in certain of our markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our restaurants, legal, auditing and other professional fees, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA represents net income before income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock compensation expense and other income or expense. Restaurant-Level EBITDA represents income from operations adjusted to exclude general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other lease charges and other income or expense. Adjusted net income represents net income adjusted to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, other income and expense, the related income tax effect of these adjustments and the reversal in 2016 of a valuation allowance on all of our net deferred income tax assets. Adjusted net income\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nalso presents the provision or benefit for income taxes as if there was no valuation allowance on our net deferred income tax assets during all periods presented.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We are presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income because we believe that they provide a more meaningful comparison than EBITDA and net income of our core business operating results, as well as with those of other similar companies. Additionally, we present Restaurant-Level EBITDA because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses and other income or expense, which are not directly related to restaurant-level operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA, when viewed with our results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations on page 50, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Also, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies. For the reconciliation between net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and the reconciliation of income from operations to Restaurant-Level EBITDA, see page 50.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income have important limitations as analytical tools. These limitations include the following:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service principal or interest payments on our debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets that we currently depreciate and amortize will likely have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to fund such replacements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that our management does not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations.

The 2016 acquired restaurants included 15 fee-owned properties, of which 14 were subsequently sold in sale-leaseback transactions in 2016 for net proceeds of $19.1 million.\nThe pro forma impact on the results of operations for the 2018 acquired restaurants is included below. The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of any future consolidated operating results. This pro forma financial information does not give effect to any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings or any transaction costs related to the 2018 acquired restaurants. The following table summarizes certain pro forma financial information related to our 2018 operating results:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,217,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nUnder the operating agreement with BKC, beginning on January 1, 2016 and until we exceed operating 1,000 Burger King\u00ae restaurants, a minimum of 10% of our annual new restaurant growth (including acquisitions) must come from the development of new Burger King\u00ae restaurants (which includes restaurants we relocate within their market area). At December 30, 2018, we were in compliance with this commitment.\nWithout giving effect to the Mergers and the Financing being consummated, in 2019, we expect that capital expenditures before discretionary growth-related expenditures (i.e. new restaurant development and acquisitions) will be $50 million to $60 million, although the actual amount of capital expenditures may differ from these estimates. Capital expenditures in 2019 include remodeling 20 to 25 restaurants to the BKC current image standard and upgrading 60 to 70 restaurants currently at the BKC 20/20 restaurant image to the exterior requirements of the Burger King of Tomorrow image including, but not limited to, landscaping, double drive-thru (where applicable), and exterior digital menu boards. We expect to receive a contribution from BKC of approximately $7.0 million to $8.0 million toward the upgrades to restaurants in 2019 whereby BKC is landlord on the lease, should the Area Development Agreement become effective. In addition, capital expenditures include the construction of 15 to 20 new units, of which 3 to 4 restaurants may be relocated within their respective markets. We will review on an ongoing basis our future remodel and development plans in relation to our available capital resources and alternate investment opportunities.\nFuture Restaurant Closures\nWe evaluate the performance of our restaurants on an ongoing basis including an assessment of the current and future operating results of the restaurant in relation to its cash flow and future occupancy costs, and with regard to franchise agreement renewals, the cost of required capital improvements. We may elect to close restaurants based on these evaluations.\nIn 2018, excluding one restaurant relocated within its trade area, we closed nine restaurants. We currently anticipate closing 8 to 12 restaurants in 2019, excluding any restaurants being relocated within their trade area, at the end of their respective lease term.\nOur determination of whether to close restaurants in the future is subject to further evaluation and may change. We may incur lease charges in the future from closures of underperforming restaurants prior to the expiration of their contractual lease term. We do not believe that the future impact on our results of operations due to restaurant closures will be material, although there can be no assurance in this regard.\nEffect of Tax law changes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which we refer to as the \"Act\", was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act made significant changes to the Federal tax code, including a reduction in the Federal income tax statutory rate from 35% to 21%. We recorded of a $0.8 million discrete tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 to remeasure our net deferred taxes due to the lowering of the Federal income tax statutory rate to 21%.\nEffect of Minimum Wage Increases\nCertain of the states and municipalities in which we operate have increased their minimum wage rates for 2018 and in many cases have also approved additional increases for future periods. Most notably, New York State has increased the minimum wage applicable to our business to $12.75 an hour in 2019 ($11.75 per hour in 2018, $10.75 per hour in 2017 and $9.75 an hour in 2016) with subsequent annual increases reaching $15.00 an hour by July 1, 2021. Since 2015 we have been receiving New York State minimum wage tax credits totaling approximately $500,000 per year that partially offset these additional labor costs. However, the New York State minimum wage tax credits expired in the beginning in 2019. We had 128 restaurants in New York State at December 30, 2018. We typically attempt to offset the effects of wage inflation, at least in part, through periodic menu price increases. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset these wage increases in the future.\nRefinancing of Indebtedness and Amendment to Our Senior Credit Facility\nOn June 23, 2017, we issued an additional $75 million principal amount of 8% Notes at a premium of 106.5% in a private placement and used a portion of the net proceeds to repay all of our revolving credit borrowings under our amended senior credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses. We received net proceeds of approximately $35.5 million from the offering which has been and will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including future restaurant acquisitions.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to increase the permitted indebtedness for our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million of 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017.\nAdditionally, on January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings by $18.0 million to a total of $73.0 million.\nSubsequent Events\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn November 30, 2018, Carrols Restaurant Group entered into a Preferred Stock Exchange Agreement whereby BKC exchanged 100 shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Carrols Restaurant Group held by BKC for 100 shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share newly issued by Carrols Restaurant Group. The powers, preferences and rights of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are substantially similar to those of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, that the shares are convertible into the same number of shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's Common Stock on an as-converted basis), except that the shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be transferred by BKC to certain other entities that are both affiliates of BKC and either Restaurant Brands International Inc. or Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership, each an indirect parent of BKC, without the termination of the rights that were previously granted solely to BKC under the Series A Preferred Stock. In connection with the Exchange, Carrols Restaurant Group issued 100 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to BKC and retired the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe Merger Agreement\nOn February 19, 2019, we agreed to purchase the business of the subsidiaries of Cambridge Franchise Holdings, LLC, which includes 166 Burger King\u00ae restaurants, 55 Popeyes\u00ae restaurants, six convenience stores and certain real property through a merger of Carrols CFP Merger Sub and New CFH in consideration of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share equal to 19.9% of outstanding shares of NewCRG Common Stock calculated immediately prior to the issuance of NewCRG Common Stock to Cambridge Holdings and 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. The consummation of the Cambridge Merger is subject to certain conditions and may be terminated, among other things, (i) by mutual consent of us and Cambridge Holdings, (ii) by us or Cambridge Holdings upon a breach of a representation and warranty in the Merger Agreement which has not been cured or (iii) if the closing of the transaction has not occurred on or prior to June 15, 2019.\nSeries C Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn connection with the closing of the Cambridge Merger, Cambridge Holdings will receive 10,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock shall (i) accrue a dividend of 9% per annum (accrued on a\ndaily basis) that will be payable by increasing the Stated Value per share of the Series C Preferred Stock every six months from the date of issuance, provided that if the Series C Preferred Stock is converted into NewCRG Common Stock prior to a Dividend Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid dividend since the date of the prior Dividend Payment Date shall be forfeited upon conversion, (ii) be subject to an Issuance Restriction, (iii) be initially convertible into a number of shares of NewCRG Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the difference of (A) the Equity Consideration Amount and (B) the product of (x) the number of NewCRG Investor Shares and (y) 13.5 and (2) 13.5, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution provisions and (iii) be automatically convertible into shares of NewCRG Common Stock upon Stockholder Approval (as defined below). The Equity Consideration Amount\u201d means the difference of (a) $200,000,000 and (b) the amount, if any, by which Net Debt (as defined in the Merger Agreement) exceeds $115,000,000. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the removal of the Issuance Restriction will be subject to obtaining the approval of NewCRG's stockholders at its next annual meeting of stockholders to be held after the closing of the transaction or at subsequent meetings of stockholders, if necessary, until the approval of NewCRG's stockholders is obtained.\nHolding Company Reorganization\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the completion of the Cambridge Merger, we will implement the Holding Company Reorganization, which will result in NewCRG owning all of the capital stock of Carrols Restaurant Group. NewCRG will initially be a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, Carrols Merger Sub, a newly formed entity and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group, will merge with and into Carrols Restaurant Group, with Carrols Restaurant Group surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG. Each share of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization will automatically be exchanged into an equivalent corresponding share of NewCRG Common Stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock being converted. Each share of Carrols Restaurant Group Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization will automatically be exchanged into an equivalent corresponding share of NewCRG Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Carrols Restaurant Group Series B Preferred Stock being converted. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Carrols Restaurant Group's current stockholders will become stockholders of NewCRG.\nFollowing the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the name of NewCRG will be changed to Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc.\u201d, the name of Carrols Restaurant Group will be changed to Carrols Holdco Inc.\u201d, and shares of NewCRG Common Stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the Carrols Restaurant Group's symbol TAST\u201d.\nArea Development and Remodeling Agreement\nWe have entered into an Area Development and Remodeling Agreement (the Area Development Agreement\u201d) which will be subject to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Mergers, and have a term commencing on, the date of the closing of the Merger Agreement, and ending on September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the Area Development Agreement, which will supersede the amended operating agreement, BKC will grant us franchise pre-approval and assign to us its right of first refusal on franchise restaurant transfers, in 16 states, which include Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia (subject to certain exceptions for certain limited geographic areas within certain states) until the date that Carrols LLC has acquired more than an aggregate of 500 Burger King Restaurants.

Total restaurant sales in 2018 increased 8.3% to $1,179.3 million from $1,088.5 million in 2017. Comparable restaurant sales increased 3.8% due to an increase in average check of 2.8% and an increase in customer traffic of 1.0%. The effect of menu price increases in 2018 was approximately 2.5%. Restaurant sales also increased $25.4 million from the full year impact of restaurants acquired in 2017, restaurant sales of $16.9 million from the acquisition of 44 restaurants during 2018 and sales of $18.8 million from the opening of new restaurants since the end of 2017.\nTotal restaurant sales in 2017 increased 15.4% to $1,088.5 million and included a comparable restaurant sales increase of 5.2% driven by an increase in average check of 4.0% and an increase in customer traffic of 1.2%. The effect of menu price increases in 2017 was approximately 2.3%. Restaurant sales also increased due to the 64 restaurants acquired since the beginning of 2017.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017 selected operating results as a percentage of total restaurant sales:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses (all restaurants):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant wages and related expenses\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant rent expense\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other restaurant operating expenses\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising expense\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Costs and Expenses (percentages stated as a percentage of total restaurant sales unless otherwise noted). Cost of sales decreased to 27.7% in 2018 from 28.0% in 2017 due primarily to the favorable impact of menu price increases (0.8%) and lower commodity costs (0.3%), which included a 4.9% decrease in beef prices compared to the prior year, offset in part by the effect of higher promotional discounting (0.8%).\nCost of sales increased to 28.0% in 2017 from 26.5% in 2016 due primarily to higher commodity costs (1.1%), which included a 9.4% increase in beef prices compared to 2016, higher promotional discounting (0.6%) and the\nnegative impact of changes in product mix offset in part by the effect of menu price increases (0.7%) and the continued improvement in restaurant-level food and cash controls at our acquired restaurants.\nRestaurant wages and related expenses increased to 32.5% in 2018 from 32.2% in 2017 due to wage inflation increasing hourly labor rates, including the effect of minimum wage increases. The increase in restaurant wages and related expenses to 32.2% in 2017 from 31.6% in 2016 was also due to higher hourly labor rates.\nRestaurant rent expense decreased slightly to 6.9% in 2018 from 7.0% in 2017 primarily due to leveraging of fixed rentals on the increased restaurant sales. Restaurant rent expense increased slightly to 7.0% in 2017 from 6.9% in 2016 primarily due to incremental rent from sale-leaseback transactions completed in 2016 offset partially by leveraging of rent on the sales increases.\nOther restaurant operating expenses decreased slightly to 15.2% in 2018 from 15.3% in 2017 and 15.8% in 2016. This reduction is due primarily to leveraging of our fixed operating costs, including utilities and repair and maintenance expense, on higher sales volumes.\nAdvertising expense was 4.1% in both 2018 and 2017. Advertising expense decreased to 4.1% in 2017 from 4.4% in 2016 due to a reduction in local advertising spending in certain of our markets in 2017 from the prior year.\nRestaurant-Level EBITDA. As a result of the factors above Restaurant-Level EBITDA increased 10.4% to $161.7 million in 2018 compared to $146.5 million in 2017 and $140.6 million in 2016. For a reconciliation between Restaurant-Level EBITDA and income from operations see page 50.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $66.6 million in 2018 compared to $60.3 million in 2017, and increased as a percentage of total restaurant sales, from 5.5% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2018. General and administrative expenses increased in dollars during 2018 from additional field management and restaurant manager training costs related to our acquisitions, growth to support our restaurant development and technology initiatives, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million primarily from stock awards granted in 2018 and an increase of $2.2 million in incentive compensation accruals based on our operating results in relation to our plan in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $5.3 million in 2017 to $60.3 million compared to $55.0 million in 2016, and decreased as a percentage of total restaurant sales, from 5.8% in 2016 to 5.5% in 2017. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during 2017 was driven by additional field management and restaurant manager training costs related to the 2017 and 2016 acquisitions and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million from stock awards granted in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in incentive compensation accruals based on our operating results in relation to our plan in 2017 versus 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. As a result of the factors above Adjusted EBITDA increased $10.9 million or 11.9% to $102.3 million in 2018 from $91.4 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.1% in 2017 from $89.5 million in 2016.\nFor a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA see page 50.\nDepreciation and Amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense to $58.5 million in 2018 from $54.2 million in 2017 was primarily due to our ongoing new development, restaurant remodeling initiatives and depreciation and amortization expense related to our acquisition of restaurants in 2017 and 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.9 million during 2017 from $47.3 million in 2016 due to our capital spending on restaurant remodeling and depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the 2016 and 2017 acquisitions.\nImpairment and Other Lease Charges. We recorded impairment and other lease charges of $3.7 million consisting of $0.4 million of capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $0.4 million related to initial impairment charges for six underperforming restaurants, $1.9 million related to the write-off of defective product holding unit kitchen equipment that was replaced, losses of $0.8 million associated with sale-leaseback transactions of four restaurant properties, and other lease charges of $0.2 million.\nWe recorded impairment and other lease charges of $2.8 million in 2017 and included $0.7 million of capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $1.1 million related to initial impairment charges for five underperforming restaurants, $0.9 million of other lease charges primarily due to four restaurants and an administrative office closed during the period and losses of $0.1 million associated with the sale-leaseback of one restaurant property.\nWe recorded impairment and other lease charges during 2016 of $2.4 million including $0.9 million for capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $0.2 million related to initial impairment charges for four underperforming restaurants and losses of $1.2 million associated with the sale-leaseback of seven restaurant properties.\nOther Income and Expense. In 2018, we recorded a gain of $0.4 million related to an insurance recovery from a fire at one restaurant. In 2017, we recorded a net $0.3 million gain primarily related to an insurance recovery from a fire at one restaurant. In 2016, we had a gain of $1.2 million related to insurance recoveries from fires at two restaurants, a gain of $0.5 million related to a settlement for a partial condemnation of one of our operating restaurant properties, and an expense of $1.85 million related to a litigation settlement with our former Chairman and CEO.\nInterest Expense. The increase in interest expense to $23.6 million in 2018 from $21.7 million in 2017 and $18.3 million in 2016 is primarily the result of the issuance of an additional $75.0 million principal amount of 8.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 on June 23, 2017. This increase was offset in part by $0.9 million and $0.5 million of bond premium amortization in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt, excluding lease financing obligations, was 7.9% in 2018, 7.7% in 2017 and 7.9% in 2016.\nIncome Taxes. In 2018, we recorded an income tax benefit as the effect of wage tax credits, which are a large component of offsetting deferred tax assets, more than offset the federal income tax provision at the statutory rate as these credits are not directly related to the amount of pretax income reported for the year.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017, excluding discrete items, was 8.2% and is lower than the statutory rate due to the effect of fixed tax credits relative to our 2017 pretax income as the benefits of these credits are not directly related to the amount of pretax income reported in the period. We also recorded a $0.8 million discrete tax benefit in the fourth quarter to remeasure our net deferred taxes due to the lowering of the Federal statutory income tax rate to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nIn 2016, we reversed the valuation allowance on all of our net deferred income tax assets resulting in a tax benefit of $30.4 million. Excluding the valuation allowance reversal, we recorded a provision for income taxes in 2016 of $2.3 million. The 2016 effective tax rate of 13.2%, exclusive of the valuation allowance reversal, is lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to employment tax credits.\nNet Income. As a result of the above, net income was $10.1 million in 2018, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.2 million in 2017, or $0.16 per diluted share and net income of $45.5 million in 2016, or $1.01 per diluted share.\nReconciliations of net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and income from operations to Restaurant-Level EBITDA for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

We believe cash generated from our operations, our cash balances and availability of revolving credit borrowings under our amended senior credit facility will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the permitted indebtedness of our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million of the 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017. On January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings by $18.0 million to a total of $73.0 million.\nAs is common in the restaurant industry, we maintain relatively low levels of account receivables and inventories and receive trade credit based upon negotiated terms for purchasing food products and other supplies. As a result, we may at times maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets, which results in a working capital deficit. We are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>restaurant operations are primarily conducted on a cash basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash from restaurant sales is usually received before related liabilities for food, supplies and payroll become due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Operating activities. Net cash provided from operating activities for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 was $80.8 million, $72.8 million and $62.3 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased by $8.0 million compared to 2017 due primarily to higher net income and depreciation.\nNet cash provided from operating activities in 2017 increased by $10.5 million compared to 2016 due primarily an increase from the changes in the components of working capital of $10.3 million.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 was $106.9 million, $108.1 million and $96.2 million, respectively. Net cash used for investing activities decreased $1.2 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily\ndue to higher proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. Net cash used for investing activities increased $11.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sale-leaseback proceeds of $49.3 million offset in part by lower acquisition and capital spending.\nCapital expenditures are a large component of our investing activities and include: (1) new restaurant development, which may include the purchase of real estate; (2) restaurant remodeling, which includes the renovation or rebuilding of the interior and exterior of our existing restaurants including expenses associated with our franchise agreement renewals and certain restaurants that we acquire; (3) other restaurant capital expenditures, which include capital maintenance expenditures for the ongoing reinvestment and enhancement of our restaurants, and from time to time, to support BKC's initiatives; and (4) corporate and restaurant information systems, including expenditures for our point-of-sale software for restaurants that we acquire.\nThe following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 30, 2018:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New restaurant development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant remodeling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other restaurant capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and restaurant information systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of new restaurant openings including relocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New restaurant development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant remodeling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other restaurant capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and restaurant information systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of new restaurant openings including relocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended January 1, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New restaurant development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant remodeling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other restaurant capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and restaurant information systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of new restaurant openings including relocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed above, in 2018, we acquired 44 restaurants in four transactions for a total cash purchase price of $38.1 million. In 2017, we acquired 64 restaurants in three transactions for a total cash purchase price of $37.9 million. In 2016, we acquired 56 restaurants in seven transactions for a total cash purchase price of $48.1 million.\nInvesting activities also included sale-leaseback transactions related to our restaurant properties. In 2018, these transactions primarily related to land purchases and new restaurant construction. In 2017 and 2016 the sale-leaseback transactions were primarily fee-owned properties acquired in restaurant acquisitions. The proceeds were $8.4 million in 2018, $4.3 million in 2017 and $53.6 million in 2016 and were used to fund our new development and remodeling initiatives, acquisition of restaurants and other cash requirements.\nWe also had expenditures related to the purchase of restaurant properties to be sold in sale-leaseback transactions of $2.1 million in 2018, $1.4 million in 2017 and $9.0 million in 2016.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 was $0.7 million due primarily to principal payments on capital leases of $1.8 million and proceeds from lease financing obligations of $2.7 million.\nNet cash provided from financing activities in 2017 was $62.7 million due primarily to proceeds of $79.9 million from the issuance of the additional $75.0 million principal amount of 8% Notes at a premium offset by the net repayment of revolving credit borrowings of $13.5 million and principal payments on capital leases of $1.7 million.\n8% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. The $275 million principal amount of 8% Notes mature on May 1, 2022. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. The 8% Notes are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and are secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets (including a pledge of all of the capital stock and equity interests of our subsidiaries).\nThe 8% Notes are redeemable at our option in whole or in part at any time after May 1, 2018 at a price of 104% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed before May 1, 2019, 102% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed after May 1, 2019 but before May 1, 2020 and 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed after May 1, 2020.\nThe 8% Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed, unconditionally and in full by our subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly 100% owned by us. Separate condensed consolidating information is not included because Carrols Restaurant Group is a holding company that has no independent assets or operations. There are no significant restrictions on our ability or any of the guarantor subsidiaries' ability to obtain funds from its respective subsidiaries. All consolidated amounts in our financial statements are representative of the combined guarantors.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes includes certain covenants, including limitations and restrictions on our and our subsidiaries who are guarantors under such indenture to, among other things: incur indebtedness or issue preferred stock; incur liens; pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; sell assets; agree to payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries; enter into transaction with affiliates; or merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance as of December 30, 2018 with the restrictive covenants of the indenture governing the 8% Notes.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes and the security agreement provide that any capital stock and equity interests of any of our subsidiaries will be excluded from the collateral to the extent that the par value, book value or market value of such capital stock or equity interests exceeds 20% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8% Notes then outstanding.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes contains customary default provisions, including without limitation, a cross default provision pursuant to which it is an event of default under the 8% Notes and the indenture governing the 8% Notes if there is a default under any of our indebtedness having an outstanding principal amount of $20.0 million or more which results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its stated maturity or is caused by a failure to pay principal when due.\nSenior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2012, we entered into a senior credit facility, which was most recently amended on June 20, 2017 to increase the permitted indebtedness of our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million principal amount of the 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017. On January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings to $73.0 million (including $20.0 million available for letters of credit). The amended senior credit facility also provides for potential incremental borrowing increases of up to $25.0 million, in the aggregate, and will mature on February 12, 2021.\nAt December 30, 2018 there were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding and $11.6 million of letters of credit were issued under the amended senior credit facility. After reserving for issued letters of credit, $61.4 million was available for revolving credit borrowings under the amended senior credit facility at December 30, 2018.\nBorrowings under the amended senior credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, based on (all terms as defined in our amended senior credit facility):\n(i) the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin of 1.75% to 2.75% based on the our Adjusted Leverage Ratio, or\n(ii) the LIBOR Rate plus the applicable margin of 2.75% to 3.75% based on the our Adjusted Leverage Ratio.\nAt December 30, 2018, our Alternate Base Rate margin was 1.75% and our LIBOR Rate margin was 2.75% based on our Adjusted Leverage Ratio.\nOur obligations under the amended senior credit facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries, including a pledge of all of the capital stock and equity interests of our subsidiaries.\nUnder the amended senior credit facility, we are required to make mandatory prepayments of borrowings in the event of dispositions of assets, debt issuances and insurance and condemnation proceeds (all subject to certain exceptions).\nThe amended senior credit facility contains certain covenants, including without limitation, those limiting our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the character of its business in all material respects, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments, make certain restricted payments or pay dividends. In addition, the amended senior credit facility requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Adjusted Leverage Ratio and First Lien Leverage Ratio (all as defined under the amended senior credit facility). We were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility at December 30, 2018.\nThe amended senior credit facility contains customary default provisions, including that the lenders may terminate their obligation to advance and may declare the unpaid balance of borrowings, or any part thereof, immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of customary defaults which include, without limitation, payment default, covenant defaults, bankruptcy type defaults, cross-defaults on other indebtedness, judgments or upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 30, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations, including interest (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations, including interest (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing obligations, including interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,353,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Our long term debt at December 30, 2018 included $275.0 million of 8% Notes.

Also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers' compensation, general liability and employee healthcare claims for which we pay all claims, subject to annual stop-loss limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate. The majority of our recorded liabilities related to self-insured employee health and insurance plans represent estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. The total of these liabilities was $8.5 million at December 30, 2018.\nFuture restaurant remodeling obligations to BKC have also been excluded from the table above as well as contractual obligations related to royalties and advertising payable to BKC.\nLong-Term Debt Obligations. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for details of our long-term debt.\nLease Guarantees. Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. (\"Fiesta\"), our former wholly-owned subsidiary, was spun-off in 2012 to our stockholders. As of December 30, 2018, we are a guarantor under 27 Fiesta restaurant property leases, of which all except for one are still operating, with lease terms expiring on various dates through 2030. We are the\nprimary lessee on five Fiesta restaurant property leases, which we sublease to Fiesta. We are fully liable for all obligations under the terms of the leases in the event that Fiesta fails to pay any sums due under the lease, subject to indemnification provisions of the separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin-off.\nThe maximum potential liability for future rental payments we could be required to make under these leases at December 30, 2018 was $16.3 million. The obligations under these leases will generally continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire. No payments have been made to date and none are expected to be required to be made in the future. We have not recorded a liability for those guarantees in accordance with ASC 460 - Guarantees as Fiesta has indemnified us for all such obligations and we did not believe it was probable we would be required to perform under any of the guarantees or direct obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than our operating leases, which are primarily for our restaurant properties and not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nInflation\nThe inflationary factors that have historically affected our results of operations include increases in food and paper costs, labor and other operating expenses, the cost of providing medical and prescription drug insurance to our employees and energy costs. Wages paid in our restaurants are impacted by changes in the Federal and state hourly minimum wage rates and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Accordingly, changes in the Federal and state hourly minimum wage rates directly affect our labor costs. We typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation, at least in part, through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Significant Accounting Policies\u201d footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.\nSales recognition at our restaurants is straightforward as customers pay for products at the time of sale and inventory turns over very quickly. Payments to vendors for products sold in the restaurants are generally settled within 30 days. The earnings reporting process is covered by our system of internal controls and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments. However, critical accounting estimates and judgments, as noted below, are inherent in the assessment and recording of the fair market values of acquired restaurant assets and liabilities, insurance liabilities, the valuation of deferred income tax assets, assessing impairment of long-lived assets and lease accounting matters. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions.\nAcquisition Accounting. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, \"Business Combinations\" (\"ASC 805\"). As required by ASC 805, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their respective fair values as of the business combination date. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, favorable and unfavorable leases and intangible assets. We use available information to make these fair value determinations and, when necessary, engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of favorable or unfavorable leases and intangible assets.\nInsurance Liabilities. The amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and medical insurance claims under policies where we pay all claims, subject to annual stop-loss insurance limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate. We record insurance\nliabilities based on historical trends, which are continually monitored, and adjust accruals as warranted by changing circumstances. Since there are estimates and assumptions inherent in recording these insurance liabilities, including the ability to estimate the future development of incurred claims based on historical claims experience and loss reserves, current claim data, and the severity of the claims, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities. As of December 30, 2018, we had $8.5 million accrued for these insurance claims.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We assess the potential impairment of long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine if there is an impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our restaurants. If assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In determining future cash flows, significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term, including sales trends, labor rates, commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions which can be impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. Our fair value estimates are also subject to a high degree of judgment, including our ability to sell the related assets and changing market conditions. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary from those estimates used, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future.\nLease Accounting. Judgments made by management for our lease obligations include the length of the lease term, which includes the determination of renewal options that are reasonably assured. The lease term can affect the classification of a lease as capital or operating for accounting purposes, the term over which related leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized, and any rent holidays and/or changes in rental amounts for recognizing rent expense over the term of the lease. These judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used.\nWe also must evaluate sales of our restaurants which occur in sale-leaseback transactions to determine the proper accounting for the proceeds of such sales either as a sale or a financing. This evaluation requires certain judgments in determining whether clauses in the lease or any related agreements constitute continuing involvement. For those sale-leasebacks that are accounted for as financing transactions, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate, or another rate in cases where the incremental borrowing rate is not appropriate to utilize, for purposes of determining interest expense and the resulting amortization of the lease financing obligation. Changes in the determination of the incremental borrowing rates or other rates utilized in connection with the accounting for lease financing transactions could have a significant effect on the interest expense and underlying balance of the lease financing obligations.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur fiscal years consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 each contained 52 weeks.\nIntroduction\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, Carrols, Carrols LLC and Republic Foods, Inc., and have no assets other than the shares of capital stock of Carrols, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary. The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d ( MD&A\u201d) is written to help the reader understand our company. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying consolidated financial statement footnotes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A, which include the following:\nCompany Overview-a general description of our business and our key financial measures.\nRecent and Future Events Affecting Our Results of Operations-a description of recent events that affect, and future events that may affect, our results of operations.\nResults of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 including a review of the material items and known trends and uncertainties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of our cash flows, including capital expenditures, changes in capital resources and known trends that may impact liquidity.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies-an overview of accounting policies requiring critical judgments and estimates.\nNew accounting pronouncements - a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation, and the impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations, if any.\nCompany Overview\nWe are one of the largest restaurant companies in the United States and have been operating restaurants for more than 55 years. We are the largest Burger King\u00ae franchisee in the United States, based on number of restaurants, and have operated Burger King restaurants since 1976. As of December 30, 2018, our restaurant operations consisted of 849 franchised Burger King restaurants in 18 states.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2018, we acquired 44 restaurants in four separate transactions which we refer to as the \"2018 acquired restaurants\". During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 64 restaurants in three separate transactions, which we refer to as the \"2017 acquired restaurants,\" and during the year ended January 1, 2017, we acquired 56 Burger King\u00ae restaurants in seven separate transactions.\nThe following is an overview of the key financial measures discussed in our results of operations:\n \u2022 Restaurant sales consist of food and beverage sales at our restaurants, net of discounts and excluding sales tax collected. Restaurant sales are influenced by changes in comparable restaurant sales, menu price increases, new restaurant development, acquisition of restaurants, and the closures of restaurants. Restaurants, including restaurants we acquire, are included in comparable restaurant sales after they have been open or owned for 12 months and immediately after they open from being remodeled. For comparative purposes, where applicable, the calculation of the changes in comparable restaurant sales is based either on a 53-week or 52-week year. \n \u2022 Cost of sales consists of food, paper and beverage costs including packaging costs, less purchase discounts. Cost of sales is generally influenced by changes in commodity costs, the mix of items sold and the level of promotional discounting and the effectiveness of our restaurant-level controls to manage food and paper costs. \n \u2022 Restaurant wages and related expenses include all restaurant management and hourly productive labor costs and related benefits, employer payroll taxes and restaurant-level bonuses. Payroll and related benefits are subject to inflation, including minimum wage increases and increased costs for health insurance, workers' compensation insurance and federal and state unemployment insurance. \n \u2022 Restaurant rent expense includes base rent and contingent rent on our leases characterized as operating leases and the amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, reduced by the amortization of deferred gains on sale-leaseback transactions. \n \u2022 Other restaurant operating expenses include all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are royalty expenses paid to BKC, utilities, repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and credit card fees. \n \u2022 Advertising expense includes advertising payments to BKC based on a percentage of sales as required under our franchise and operating agreements and additional marketing and promotional expenses in certain of our markets. \n \u2022 General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our restaurants, legal, auditing and other professional fees, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation expense. \n \u2022 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA represents net income before income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock compensation expense and other income or expense. Restaurant-Level EBITDA represents income from operations adjusted to exclude general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other lease charges and other income or expense. Adjusted net income represents net income adjusted to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, other income and expense, the related income tax effect of these adjustments and the reversal in 2016 of a valuation allowance on all of our net deferred income tax assets. Adjusted net income \nalso presents the provision or benefit for income taxes as if there was no valuation allowance on our net deferred income tax assets during all periods presented.\n \u2022 We are presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income because we believe that they provide a more meaningful comparison than EBITDA and net income of our core business operating results, as well as with those of other similar companies. Additionally, we present Restaurant-Level EBITDA because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses and other income or expense, which are not directly related to restaurant-level operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA, when viewed with our results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations on page 50, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.  However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Also, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies. For the reconciliation between net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and the reconciliation of income from operations to Restaurant-Level EBITDA, see page 50.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income have important limitations as analytical tools. These limitations include the following:\n \u2022 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment; \n \u2022 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service principal or interest payments on our debt; \n \u2022 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets that we currently depreciate and amortize will likely have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to fund such replacements; and \n \u2022 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that our management does not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. However, some of these charges (such as impairment and other lease charges and acquisition costs) have recurred and may reoccur. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization primarily includes the depreciation of fixed assets, including equipment, owned buildings and leasehold improvements utilized in our restaurants, the amortization of franchise rights from our acquisitions of Burger King\u00ae restaurants and the amortization of franchise fees paid to BKC. \n \u2022 Impairment and other lease charges are determined through our assessment of the recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of these assets can be recovered over their respective remaining lives through undiscounted future operating cash flows. A potential impairment charge is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Losses on sale-leaseback transactions are recognized when they are incurred. Lease charges are recorded for our obligations under the related leases for closed locations net of estimated sublease recoveries. \n \u2022 Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our $275.0 million of 8% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 (the \"8% Notes\"), our prior 11.25% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2018 (the \"11.25% Notes\"), amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of bond premium and interest on revolving credit borrowings under our senior credit facility. \nRecent and Future Events Affecting our Results of Operations\nBurger King\u00ae Restaurant Acquisitions\nFrom the beginning of 2016 through December 30, 2018, we have acquired 164 restaurants from other franchisees, in the following transactions ($ in thousands):\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closing Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Restaurants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Fee-Owned Restaurants\n</td> <td>Market Location\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 Acquisitions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 23, 2016\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 25, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>Detroit, Michigan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 14, 2016\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>Detroit, Michigan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 23, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>Portland, Maine\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 4, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Raleigh, North Carolina\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pittsburgh and Johnstown, Pennsylvania\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>Columbus, Ohio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 Acquisitions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cincinnati, Ohio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 5, 2017\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, DC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maine\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Acquisitions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 13, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New York\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 21, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Detroit, Michigan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 5, 2018\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Western Virginia\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>South Carolina and Georgia\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Acquisitions resulting from the exercise of our ROFR.  All of the 2018 and 2017 acquired restaurants were leased properties. The 2016 acquired restaurants included 15 fee-owned properties, of which 14 were subsequently sold in sale-leaseback transactions in 2016 for net proceeds of $19.1 million.\nThe pro forma impact on the results of operations for the 2018 acquired restaurants is included below. The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of any future consolidated operating results. This pro forma financial information does not give effect to any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings or any transaction costs related to the 2018 acquired restaurants. The following table summarizes certain pro forma financial information related to our 2018 operating results:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,217,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nUnder the operating agreement with BKC, beginning on January 1, 2016 and until we exceed operating 1,000 Burger King\u00ae restaurants, a minimum of 10% of our annual new restaurant growth (including acquisitions) must come from the development of new Burger King\u00ae restaurants (which includes restaurants we relocate within their market area). At December 30, 2018, we were in compliance with this commitment.\nWithout giving effect to the Mergers and the Financing being consummated, in 2019, we expect that capital expenditures before discretionary growth-related expenditures (i.e. new restaurant development and acquisitions) will be $50 million to $60 million, although the actual amount of capital expenditures may differ from these estimates. Capital expenditures in 2019 include remodeling 20 to 25 restaurants to the BKC current image standard and upgrading 60 to 70 restaurants currently at the BKC 20/20 restaurant image to the exterior requirements of the Burger King of Tomorrow image including, but not limited to, landscaping, double drive-thru (where applicable), and exterior digital menu boards. We expect to receive a contribution from BKC of approximately $7.0 million to $8.0 million toward the upgrades to restaurants in 2019 whereby BKC is landlord on the lease, should the Area Development Agreement become effective. In addition, capital expenditures include the construction of 15 to 20 new units, of which 3 to 4 restaurants may be relocated within their respective markets. We will review on an ongoing basis our future remodel and development plans in relation to our available capital resources and alternate investment opportunities.\nFuture Restaurant Closures\nWe evaluate the performance of our restaurants on an ongoing basis including an assessment of the current and future operating results of the restaurant in relation to its cash flow and future occupancy costs, and with regard to franchise agreement renewals, the cost of required capital improvements. We may elect to close restaurants based on these evaluations.\nIn 2018, excluding one restaurant relocated within its trade area, we closed nine restaurants. We currently anticipate closing 8 to 12 restaurants in 2019, excluding any restaurants being relocated within their trade area, at the end of their respective lease term.\nOur determination of whether to close restaurants in the future is subject to further evaluation and may change. We may incur lease charges in the future from closures of underperforming restaurants prior to the expiration of their contractual lease term. We do not believe that the future impact on our results of operations due to restaurant closures will be material, although there can be no assurance in this regard.\nEffect of Tax law changes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which we refer to as the \"Act\", was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act made significant changes to the Federal tax code, including a reduction in the Federal income tax statutory rate from 35% to 21%. We recorded of a $0.8 million discrete tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 to remeasure our net deferred taxes due to the lowering of the Federal income tax statutory rate to 21%.\nEffect of Minimum Wage Increases\nCertain of the states and municipalities in which we operate have increased their minimum wage rates for 2018 and in many cases have also approved additional increases for future periods. Most notably, New York State has increased the minimum wage applicable to our business to $12.75 an hour in 2019 ($11.75 per hour in 2018, $10.75 per hour in 2017 and $9.75 an hour in 2016) with subsequent annual increases reaching $15.00 an hour by July 1, 2021. Since 2015 we have been receiving New York State minimum wage tax credits totaling approximately $500,000 per year that partially offset these additional labor costs. However, the New York State minimum wage tax credits expired in the beginning in 2019. We had 128 restaurants in New York State at December 30, 2018. We typically attempt to offset the effects of wage inflation, at least in part, through periodic menu price increases. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset these wage increases in the future.\nRefinancing of Indebtedness and Amendment to Our Senior Credit Facility\nOn June 23, 2017, we issued an additional $75 million principal amount of 8% Notes at a premium of 106.5% in a private placement and used a portion of the net proceeds to repay all of our revolving credit borrowings under our amended senior credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses. We received net proceeds of approximately $35.5 million from the offering which has been and will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including future restaurant acquisitions.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to increase the permitted indebtedness for our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million of 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017.\nAdditionally, on January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings by $18.0 million to a total of $73.0 million.\nSubsequent Events\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn November 30, 2018, Carrols Restaurant Group entered into a Preferred Stock Exchange Agreement whereby BKC exchanged 100 shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Carrols Restaurant Group held by BKC for 100 shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share newly issued by Carrols Restaurant Group. The powers, preferences and rights of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are substantially similar to those of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, that the shares are convertible into the same number of shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's Common Stock on an as-converted basis), except that the shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be transferred by BKC to certain other entities that are both affiliates of BKC and either Restaurant Brands International Inc. or Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership, each an indirect parent of BKC, without the termination of the rights that were previously granted solely to BKC under the Series A Preferred Stock. In connection with the Exchange, Carrols Restaurant Group issued 100 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to BKC and retired the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe Merger Agreement\nOn February 19, 2019, we agreed to purchase the business of the subsidiaries of Cambridge Franchise Holdings, LLC, which includes 166 Burger King\u00ae restaurants, 55 Popeyes\u00ae restaurants, six convenience stores and certain real property through a merger of Carrols CFP Merger Sub and New CFH in consideration of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share equal to 19.9% of outstanding shares of NewCRG Common Stock calculated immediately prior to the issuance of NewCRG Common Stock to Cambridge Holdings and 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. The consummation of the Cambridge Merger is subject to certain conditions and may be terminated, among other things, (i) by mutual consent of us and Cambridge Holdings, (ii) by us or Cambridge Holdings upon a breach of a representation and warranty in the Merger Agreement which has not been cured or (iii) if the closing of the transaction has not occurred on or prior to June 15, 2019.\nSeries C Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn connection with the closing of the Cambridge Merger, Cambridge Holdings will receive 10,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock shall (i) accrue a dividend of 9% per annum (accrued on a\ndaily basis) that will be payable by increasing the Stated Value per share of the Series C Preferred Stock every six months from the date of issuance, provided that if the Series C Preferred Stock is converted into NewCRG Common Stock prior to a Dividend Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid dividend since the date of the prior Dividend Payment Date shall be forfeited upon conversion, (ii) be subject to an Issuance Restriction, (iii) be initially convertible into a number of shares of NewCRG Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the difference of (A) the Equity Consideration Amount and (B) the product of (x) the number of NewCRG Investor Shares and (y) 13.5 and (2) 13.5, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution provisions and (iii) be automatically convertible into shares of NewCRG Common Stock upon Stockholder Approval (as defined below). The Equity Consideration Amount\u201d means the difference of (a) $200,000,000 and (b) the amount, if any, by which Net Debt (as defined in the Merger Agreement) exceeds $115,000,000. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the removal of the Issuance Restriction will be subject to obtaining the approval of NewCRG's stockholders at its next annual meeting of stockholders to be held after the closing of the transaction or at subsequent meetings of stockholders, if necessary, until the approval of NewCRG's stockholders is obtained.\nHolding Company Reorganization\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the completion of the Cambridge Merger, we will implement the Holding Company Reorganization, which will result in NewCRG owning all of the capital stock of Carrols Restaurant Group. NewCRG will initially be a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, Carrols Merger Sub, a newly formed entity and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group, will merge with and into Carrols Restaurant Group, with Carrols Restaurant Group surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG. Each share of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization will automatically be exchanged into an equivalent corresponding share of NewCRG Common Stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock being converted. Each share of Carrols Restaurant Group Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization will automatically be exchanged into an equivalent corresponding share of NewCRG Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Carrols Restaurant Group Series B Preferred Stock being converted. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Carrols Restaurant Group's current stockholders will become stockholders of NewCRG.\nFollowing the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the name of NewCRG will be changed to Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc.\u201d, the name of Carrols Restaurant Group will be changed to Carrols Holdco Inc.\u201d, and shares of NewCRG Common Stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the Carrols Restaurant Group's symbol TAST\u201d.\nArea Development and Remodeling Agreement\nWe have entered into an Area Development and Remodeling Agreement (the Area Development Agreement\u201d) which will be subject to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Mergers, and have a term commencing on, the date of the closing of the Merger Agreement, and ending on September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the Area Development Agreement, which will supersede the amended operating agreement, BKC will grant us franchise pre-approval and assign to us its right of first refusal on franchise restaurant transfers, in 16 states, which include Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia (subject to certain exceptions for certain limited geographic areas within certain states) until the date that Carrols LLC has acquired more than an aggregate of 500 Burger King Restaurants. The continued assignment of the ADA ROFR is subject to suspension or termination in the event of non-compliance by Carrols LLC with certain terms as set forth in the Area Development Agreement.

Total restaurant sales in 2018 increased 8.3% to $1,179.3 million from $1,088.5 million in 2017. Comparable restaurant sales increased 3.8% due to an increase in average check of 2.8% and an increase in customer traffic of 1.0%. The effect of menu price increases in 2018 was approximately 2.5%. Restaurant sales also increased $25.4 million from the full year impact of restaurants acquired in 2017, restaurant sales of $16.9 million from the acquisition of 44 restaurants during 2018 and sales of $18.8 million from the opening of new restaurants since the end of 2017.\nTotal restaurant sales in 2017 increased 15.4% to $1,088.5 million and included a comparable restaurant sales increase of 5.2% driven by an increase in average check of 4.0% and an increase in customer traffic of 1.2%. The effect of menu price increases in 2017 was approximately 2.3%. Restaurant sales also increased due to the 64 restaurants acquired since the beginning of 2017.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017 selected operating results as a percentage of total restaurant sales:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses (all restaurants):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant wages and related expenses\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant rent expense\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other restaurant operating expenses\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising expense\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Costs and Expenses (percentages stated as a percentage of total restaurant sales unless otherwise noted). Cost of sales decreased to 27.7% in 2018 from 28.0% in 2017 due primarily to the favorable impact of menu price increases (0.8%) and lower commodity costs (0.3%), which included a 4.9% decrease in beef prices compared to the prior year, offset in part by the effect of higher promotional discounting (0.8%).\nCost of sales increased to 28.0% in 2017 from 26.5% in 2016 due primarily to higher commodity costs (1.1%), which included a 9.4% increase in beef prices compared to 2016, higher promotional discounting (0.6%) and the\nnegative impact of changes in product mix offset in part by the effect of menu price increases (0.7%) and the continued improvement in restaurant-level food and cash controls at our acquired restaurants.\nRestaurant wages and related expenses increased to 32.5% in 2018 from 32.2% in 2017 due to wage inflation increasing hourly labor rates, including the effect of minimum wage increases. The increase in restaurant wages and related expenses to 32.2% in 2017 from 31.6% in 2016 was also due to higher hourly labor rates.\nRestaurant rent expense decreased slightly to 6.9% in 2018 from 7.0% in 2017 primarily due to leveraging of fixed rentals on the increased restaurant sales. Restaurant rent expense increased slightly to 7.0% in 2017 from 6.9% in 2016 primarily due to incremental rent from sale-leaseback transactions completed in 2016 offset partially by leveraging of rent on the sales increases.\nOther restaurant operating expenses decreased slightly to 15.2% in 2018 from 15.3% in 2017 and 15.8% in 2016. This reduction is due primarily to leveraging of our fixed operating costs, including utilities and repair and maintenance expense, on higher sales volumes.\nAdvertising expense was 4.1% in both 2018 and 2017. Advertising expense decreased to 4.1% in 2017 from 4.4% in 2016 due to a reduction in local advertising spending in certain of our markets in 2017 from the prior year.\nRestaurant-Level EBITDA. As a result of the factors above Restaurant-Level EBITDA increased 10.4% to $161.7 million in 2018 compared to $146.5 million in 2017 and $140.6 million in 2016. For a reconciliation between Restaurant-Level EBITDA and income from operations see page 50.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $66.6 million in 2018 compared to $60.3 million in 2017, and increased as a percentage of total restaurant sales, from 5.5% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2018. General and administrative expenses increased in dollars during 2018 from additional field management and restaurant manager training costs related to our acquisitions, growth to support our restaurant development and technology initiatives, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million primarily from stock awards granted in 2018 and an increase of $2.2 million in incentive compensation accruals based on our operating results in relation to our plan in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $5.3 million in 2017 to $60.3 million compared to $55.0 million in 2016, and decreased as a percentage of total restaurant sales, from 5.8% in 2016 to 5.5% in 2017. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during 2017 was driven by additional field management and restaurant manager training costs related to the 2017 and 2016 acquisitions and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million from stock awards granted in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in incentive compensation accruals based on our operating results in relation to our plan in 2017 versus 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. As a result of the factors above Adjusted EBITDA increased $10.9 million or 11.9% to $102.3 million in 2018 from $91.4 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.1% in 2017 from $89.5 million in 2016.\nFor a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA see page 50.\nDepreciation and Amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense to $58.5 million in 2018 from $54.2 million in 2017 was primarily due to our ongoing new development, restaurant remodeling initiatives and depreciation and amortization expense related to our acquisition of restaurants in 2017 and 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.9 million during 2017 from $47.3 million in 2016 due to our capital spending on restaurant remodeling and depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the 2016 and 2017 acquisitions.\nImpairment and Other Lease Charges. We recorded impairment and other lease charges of $3.7 million consisting of $0.4 million of capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $0.4 million related to initial impairment charges for six underperforming restaurants, $1.9 million related to the write-off of defective product holding unit kitchen equipment that was replaced, losses of $0.8 million associated with sale-leaseback transactions of four restaurant properties, and other lease charges of $0.2 million.\nWe recorded impairment and other lease charges of $2.8 million in 2017 and included $0.7 million of capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $1.1 million related to initial impairment charges for five underperforming restaurants, $0.9 million of other lease charges primarily due to four restaurants and an administrative office closed during the period and losses of $0.1 million associated with the sale-leaseback of one restaurant property.\nWe recorded impairment and other lease charges during 2016 of $2.4 million including $0.9 million for capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $0.2 million related to initial impairment charges for four underperforming restaurants and losses of $1.2 million associated with the sale-leaseback of seven restaurant properties.\nOther Income and Expense. In 2018, we recorded a gain of $0.4 million related to an insurance recovery from a fire at one restaurant. In 2017, we recorded a net $0.3 million gain primarily related to an insurance recovery from a fire at one restaurant. In 2016, we had a gain of $1.2 million related to insurance recoveries from fires at two restaurants, a gain of $0.5 million related to a settlement for a partial condemnation of one of our operating restaurant properties, and an expense of $1.85 million related to a litigation settlement with our former Chairman and CEO.\nInterest Expense. The increase in interest expense to $23.6 million in 2018 from $21.7 million in 2017 and $18.3 million in 2016 is primarily the result of the issuance of an additional $75.0 million principal amount of 8.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 on June 23, 2017. This increase was offset in part by $0.9 million and $0.5 million of bond premium amortization in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt, excluding lease financing obligations, was 7.9% in 2018, 7.7% in 2017 and 7.9% in 2016.\nIncome Taxes. In 2018, we recorded an income tax benefit as the effect of wage tax credits, which are a large component of offsetting deferred tax assets, more than offset the federal income tax provision at the statutory rate as these credits are not directly related to the amount of pretax income reported for the year.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017, excluding discrete items, was 8.2% and is lower than the statutory rate due to the effect of fixed tax credits relative to our 2017 pretax income as the benefits of these credits are not directly related to the amount of pretax income reported in the period. We also recorded a $0.8 million discrete tax benefit in the fourth quarter to remeasure our net deferred taxes due to the lowering of the Federal statutory income tax rate to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nIn 2016, we reversed the valuation allowance on all of our net deferred income tax assets resulting in a tax benefit of $30.4 million. Excluding the valuation allowance reversal, we recorded a provision for income taxes in 2016 of $2.3 million. The 2016 effective tax rate of 13.2%, exclusive of the valuation allowance reversal, is lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to employment tax credits.\nNet Income. As a result of the above, net income was $10.1 million in 2018, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.2 million in 2017, or $0.16 per diluted share and net income of $45.5 million in 2016, or $1.01 per diluted share.\nReconciliations of net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and income from operations to Restaurant-Level EBITDA for the years ended

The year ended January 1, 2017 includes gains of $1.2 million related to insurance recoveries from fires at two of our restaurants and a gain of $0.5 million related to a settlement for a partial condemnation on one of our operating restaurant properties. \n (3) Includes an expense of $1.85 million related to a litigation settlement. \n (4) The income tax effect related to the adjustments (other than the deferred income tax adjustment) was calculated using an effective income tax rate of 22.2% for the year ended December 30, 2018 and 38% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017. \n (5) The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2017 reflects a $0.8 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter to to remeasure our net deferred taxes due to the lowering of the Federal income tax rate to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in the fourth quarter of 2017. The benefit for income taxes in 2016 reflects a $30.4 million income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 to reverse the previously recorded valuation allowance on net deferred income tax assets as well as the full year deferred income tax provision of $2.3 million which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n (6) Adjusted diluted net income per share is calculated based on Adjusted net income and the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective periods. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to acquire additional restaurants, develop new restaurants, enhance existing restaurants and to reduce debt.\nInterest payments under our debt obligations, capital expenditures, including our new restaurant development and restaurant remodeling initiatives in 2019, payments of royalties and advertising to BKC and payments related to our lease obligations represent significant liquidity requirements for us as well as any discretionary expenditures for the acquisition of additional Burger King\u00ae restaurants. We believe cash generated from our operations, our cash balances and availability of revolving credit borrowings under our amended senior credit facility will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the permitted indebtedness of our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million of the 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017. On January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings by $18.0 million to a total of $73.0 million.\nAs is common in the restaurant industry, we maintain relatively low levels of account receivables and inventories and receive trade credit based upon negotiated terms for purchasing food products and other supplies. As a result, we may at times maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets, which results in a working capital deficit. We are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because:\n \u2022 restaurant operations are primarily conducted on a cash basis; \n \u2022 rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories; and \n \u2022 cash from restaurant sales is usually received before related liabilities for food, supplies and payroll become due.  Operating activities. Net cash provided from operating activities for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 was $80.8 million, $72.8 million and $62.3 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased by $8.0 million compared to 2017 due primarily to higher net income and depreciation.\nNet cash provided from operating activities in 2017 increased by $10.5 million compared to 2016 due primarily an increase from the changes in the components of working capital of $10.3 million.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 was $106.9 million, $108.1 million and $96.2 million, respectively. Net cash used for investing activities decreased $1.2 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily\ndue to higher proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. Net cash used for investing activities increased $11.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sale-leaseback proceeds of $49.3 million offset in part by lower acquisition and capital spending.\nCapital expenditures are a large component of our investing activities and include: (1) new restaurant development, which may include the purchase of real estate; (2) restaurant remodeling, which includes the renovation or rebuilding of the interior and exterior of our existing restaurants including expenses associated with our franchise agreement renewals and certain restaurants that we acquire; (3) other restaurant capital expenditures, which include capital maintenance expenditures for the ongoing reinvestment and enhancement of our restaurants, and from time to time, to support BKC's initiatives; and (4) corporate and restaurant information systems, including expenditures for our point-of-sale software for restaurants that we acquire.\nThe following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 30, 2018:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New restaurant development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant remodeling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other restaurant capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and restaurant information systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of new restaurant openings including relocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New restaurant development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant remodeling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other restaurant capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and restaurant information systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of new restaurant openings including relocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended January 1, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New restaurant development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant remodeling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other restaurant capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and restaurant information systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of new restaurant openings including relocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed above, in 2018, we acquired 44 restaurants in four transactions for a total cash purchase price of $38.1 million. In 2017, we acquired 64 restaurants in three transactions for a total cash purchase price of $37.9 million. In 2016, we acquired 56 restaurants in seven transactions for a total cash purchase price of $48.1 million.\nInvesting activities also included sale-leaseback transactions related to our restaurant properties. In 2018, these transactions primarily related to land purchases and new restaurant construction. In 2017 and 2016 the sale-leaseback transactions were primarily fee-owned properties acquired in restaurant acquisitions. The proceeds were $8.4 million in 2018, $4.3 million in 2017 and $53.6 million in 2016 and were used to fund our new development and remodeling initiatives, acquisition of restaurants and other cash requirements.\nWe also had expenditures related to the purchase of restaurant properties to be sold in sale-leaseback transactions of $2.1 million in 2018, $1.4 million in 2017 and $9.0 million in 2016.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 was $0.7 million due primarily to principal payments on capital leases of $1.8 million and proceeds from lease financing obligations of $2.7 million.\nNet cash provided from financing activities in 2017 was $62.7 million due primarily to proceeds of $79.9 million from the issuance of the additional $75.0 million principal amount of 8% Notes at a premium offset by the net repayment of revolving credit borrowings of $13.5 million and principal payments on capital leases of $1.7 million.\n8% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. The $275 million principal amount of 8% Notes mature on May 1, 2022. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. The 8% Notes are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and are secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets (including a pledge of all of the capital stock and equity interests of our subsidiaries).\nThe 8% Notes are redeemable at our option in whole or in part at any time after May 1, 2018 at a price of 104% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed before May 1, 2019, 102% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed after May 1, 2019 but before May 1, 2020 and 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed after May 1, 2020.\nThe 8% Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed, unconditionally and in full by our subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly 100% owned by us. Separate condensed consolidating information is not included because Carrols Restaurant Group is a holding company that has no independent assets or operations. There are no significant restrictions on our ability or any of the guarantor subsidiaries' ability to obtain funds from its respective subsidiaries. All consolidated amounts in our financial statements are representative of the combined guarantors.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes includes certain covenants, including limitations and restrictions on our and our subsidiaries who are guarantors under such indenture to, among other things: incur indebtedness or issue preferred stock; incur liens; pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; sell assets; agree to payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries; enter into transaction with affiliates; or merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance as of December 30, 2018 with the restrictive covenants of the indenture governing the 8% Notes.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes and the security agreement provide that any capital stock and equity interests of any of our subsidiaries will be excluded from the collateral to the extent that the par value, book value or market value of such capital stock or equity interests exceeds 20% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8% Notes then outstanding.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes contains customary default provisions, including without limitation, a cross default provision pursuant to which it is an event of default under the 8% Notes and the indenture governing the 8% Notes if there is a default under any of our indebtedness having an outstanding principal amount of $20.0 million or more which results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its stated maturity or is caused by a failure to pay principal when due.\nSenior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2012, we entered into a senior credit facility, which was most recently amended on June 20, 2017 to increase the permitted indebtedness of our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million principal amount of the 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017. On January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings to $73.0 million (including $20.0 million available for letters of credit). The amended senior credit facility also provides for potential incremental borrowing increases of up to $25.0 million, in the aggregate, and will mature on February 12, 2021.\nAt December 30, 2018 there were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding and $11.6 million of letters of credit were issued under the amended senior credit facility. After reserving for issued letters of credit, $61.4 million was available for revolving credit borrowings under the amended senior credit facility at December 30, 2018.\nBorrowings under the amended senior credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, based on (all terms as defined in our amended senior credit facility):\n(i) the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin of 1.75% to 2.75% based on the our Adjusted Leverage Ratio, or\n(ii) the LIBOR Rate plus the applicable margin of 2.75% to 3.75% based on the our Adjusted Leverage Ratio.\nAt December 30, 2018, our Alternate Base Rate margin was 1.75% and our LIBOR Rate margin was 2.75% based on our Adjusted Leverage Ratio.\nOur obligations under the amended senior credit facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries, including a pledge of all of the capital stock and equity interests of our subsidiaries.\nUnder the amended senior credit facility, we are required to make mandatory prepayments of borrowings in the event of dispositions of assets, debt issuances and insurance and condemnation proceeds (all subject to certain exceptions).\nThe amended senior credit facility contains certain covenants, including without limitation, those limiting our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the character of its business in all material respects, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments, make certain restricted payments or pay dividends. In addition, the amended senior credit facility requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Adjusted Leverage Ratio and First Lien Leverage Ratio (all as defined under the amended senior credit facility). We were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility at December 30, 2018.\nThe amended senior credit facility contains customary default provisions, including that the lenders may terminate their obligation to advance and may declare the unpaid balance of borrowings, or any part thereof, immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of customary defaults which include, without limitation, payment default, covenant defaults, bankruptcy type defaults, cross-defaults on other indebtedness, judgments or upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 30, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations, including interest (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations, including interest (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing obligations, including interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,353,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Our long term debt at December 30, 2018 included $275.0 million of 8% Notes. Total interest payments on our Notes of $77.0 million for all years presented are included at the coupon rate of 8%. \n (2) Includes total interest of $0.4 million for all years presented. \n (3) Represents the aggregate minimum lease payments under operating leases. Many of our leases also require contingent rent based on a percentage of sales in addition to the minimum base rent and require expenses incidental to the use of the property all of which have been excluded from this table. \n (4) Includes total interest of $0.5 million for all years presented.  We have not included obligations under our postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table as our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance, but is funded as retiree medical claims are paid. Also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers' compensation, general liability and employee healthcare claims for which we pay all claims, subject to annual stop-loss limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate. The majority of our recorded liabilities related to self-insured employee health and insurance plans represent estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. The total of these liabilities was $8.5 million at December 30, 2018.\nFuture restaurant remodeling obligations to BKC have also been excluded from the table above as well as contractual obligations related to royalties and advertising payable to BKC.\nLong-Term Debt Obligations. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for details of our long-term debt.\nLease Guarantees. Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. (\"Fiesta\"), our former wholly-owned subsidiary, was spun-off in 2012 to our stockholders. As of December 30, 2018, we are a guarantor under 27 Fiesta restaurant property leases, of which all except for one are still operating, with lease terms expiring on various dates through 2030. We are the\nprimary lessee on five Fiesta restaurant property leases, which we sublease to Fiesta. We are fully liable for all obligations under the terms of the leases in the event that Fiesta fails to pay any sums due under the lease, subject to indemnification provisions of the separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin-off.\nThe maximum potential liability for future rental payments we could be required to make under these leases at December 30, 2018 was $16.3 million. The obligations under these leases will generally continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire. No payments have been made to date and none are expected to be required to be made in the future. We have not recorded a liability for those guarantees in accordance with ASC 460 - Guarantees as Fiesta has indemnified us for all such obligations and we did not believe it was probable we would be required to perform under any of the guarantees or direct obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than our operating leases, which are primarily for our restaurant properties and not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nInflation\nThe inflationary factors that have historically affected our results of operations include increases in food and paper costs, labor and other operating expenses, the cost of providing medical and prescription drug insurance to our employees and energy costs. Wages paid in our restaurants are impacted by changes in the Federal and state hourly minimum wage rates and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Accordingly, changes in the Federal and state hourly minimum wage rates directly affect our labor costs. We typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation, at least in part, through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Significant Accounting Policies\u201d footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.\nSales recognition at our restaurants is straightforward as customers pay for products at the time of sale and inventory turns over very quickly. Payments to vendors for products sold in the restaurants are generally settled within 30 days. The earnings reporting process is covered by our system of internal controls and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments. However, critical accounting estimates and judgments, as noted below, are inherent in the assessment and recording of the fair market values of acquired restaurant assets and liabilities, insurance liabilities, the valuation of deferred income tax assets, assessing impairment of long-lived assets and lease accounting matters. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions.\nAcquisition Accounting. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, \"Business Combinations\" (\"ASC 805\"). As required by ASC 805, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their respective fair values as of the business combination date. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, favorable and unfavorable leases and intangible assets. We use available information to make these fair value determinations and, when necessary, engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of favorable or unfavorable leases and intangible assets.\nInsurance Liabilities. The amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and medical insurance claims under policies where we pay all claims, subject to annual stop-loss insurance limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate. We record insurance\nliabilities based on historical trends, which are continually monitored, and adjust accruals as warranted by changing circumstances. Since there are estimates and assumptions inherent in recording these insurance liabilities, including the ability to estimate the future development of incurred claims based on historical claims experience and loss reserves, current claim data, and the severity of the claims, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities. As of December 30, 2018, we had $8.5 million accrued for these insurance claims.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We assess the potential impairment of long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine if there is an impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our restaurants. If assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In determining future cash flows, significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term, including sales trends, labor rates, commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions which can be impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. Our fair value estimates are also subject to a high degree of judgment, including our ability to sell the related assets and changing market conditions. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary from those estimates used, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future.\nLease Accounting. Judgments made by management for our lease obligations include the length of the lease term, which includes the determination of renewal options that are reasonably assured. The lease term can affect the classification of a lease as capital or operating for accounting purposes, the term over which related leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized, and any rent holidays and/or changes in rental amounts for recognizing rent expense over the term of the lease. These judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used.\nWe also must evaluate sales of our restaurants which occur in sale-leaseback transactions to determine the proper accounting for the proceeds of such sales either as a sale or a financing. This evaluation requires certain judgments in determining whether clauses in the lease or any related agreements constitute continuing involvement. For those sale-leasebacks that are accounted for as financing transactions, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate, or another rate in cases where the incremental borrowing rate is not appropriate to utilize, for purposes of determining interest expense and the resulting amortization of the lease financing obligation. Changes in the determination of the incremental borrowing rates or other rates utilized in connection with the accounting for lease financing transactions could have a significant effect on the interest expense and underlying balance of the lease financing obligations.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur fiscal years consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 each contained 52 weeks.\nIntroduction\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, Carrols, Carrols LLC and Republic Foods, Inc., and have no assets other than the shares of capital stock of Carrols, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary. The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d ( MD&A\u201d) is written to help the reader understand our company. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying consolidated financial statement footnotes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A, which include the following:\nCompany Overview-a general description of our business and our key financial measures.\nRecent and Future Events Affecting Our Results of Operations-a description of recent events that affect, and future events that may affect, our results of operations.\nResults of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 including a review of the material items and known trends and uncertainties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of our cash flows, including capital expenditures, changes in capital resources and known trends that may impact liquidity.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies-an overview of accounting policies requiring critical judgments and estimates.\nNew accounting pronouncements - a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation, and the impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations, if any.\nCompany Overview\nWe are one of the largest restaurant companies in the United States and have been operating restaurants for more than 55 years. We are the largest Burger King\u00ae franchisee in the United States, based on number of restaurants, and have operated Burger King restaurants since 1976. As of December 30, 2018, our restaurant operations consisted of 849 franchised Burger King restaurants in 18 states.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2018, we acquired 44 restaurants in four separate transactions which we refer to as the \"2018 acquired restaurants\". During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 64 restaurants in three separate transactions, which we refer to as the \"2017 acquired restaurants,\" and during the year ended January 1, 2017, we acquired 56 Burger King\u00ae restaurants in seven separate transactions.\nThe following is an overview of the key financial measures discussed in our results of operations:\n \u2022 Restaurant sales consist of food and beverage sales at our restaurants, net of discounts and excluding sales tax collected. Restaurant sales are influenced by changes in comparable restaurant sales, menu price increases, new restaurant development, acquisition of restaurants, and the closures of restaurants. Restaurants, including restaurants we acquire, are included in comparable restaurant sales after they have been open or owned for 12 months and immediately after they open from being remodeled. For comparative purposes, where applicable, the calculation of the changes in comparable restaurant sales is based either on a 53-week or 52-week year. \n \u2022 Cost of sales consists of food, paper and beverage costs including packaging costs, less purchase discounts. Cost of sales is generally influenced by changes in commodity costs, the mix of items sold and the level of promotional discounting and the effectiveness of our restaurant-level controls to manage food and paper costs. \n \u2022 Restaurant wages and related expenses include all restaurant management and hourly productive labor costs and related benefits, employer payroll taxes and restaurant-level bonuses. Payroll and related benefits are subject to inflation, including minimum wage increases and increased costs for health insurance, workers' compensation insurance and federal and state unemployment insurance. \n \u2022 Restaurant rent expense includes base rent and contingent rent on our leases characterized as operating leases and the amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, reduced by the amortization of deferred gains on sale-leaseback transactions. \n \u2022 Other restaurant operating expenses include all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are royalty expenses paid to BKC, utilities, repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and credit card fees. \n \u2022 Advertising expense includes advertising payments to BKC based on a percentage of sales as required under our franchise and operating agreements and additional marketing and promotional expenses in certain of our markets. \n \u2022 General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our restaurants, legal, auditing and other professional fees, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation expense. \n \u2022 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA represents net income before income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock compensation expense and other income or expense. Restaurant-Level EBITDA represents income from operations adjusted to exclude general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other lease charges and other income or expense. Adjusted net income represents net income adjusted to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, other income and expense, the related income tax effect of these adjustments and the reversal in 2016 of a valuation allowance on all of our net deferred income tax assets. Adjusted net income \nalso presents the provision or benefit for income taxes as if there was no valuation allowance on our net deferred income tax assets during all periods presented.\n \u2022 We are presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income because we believe that they provide a more meaningful comparison than EBITDA and net income of our core business operating results, as well as with those of other similar companies. Additionally, we present Restaurant-Level EBITDA because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses and other income or expense, which are not directly related to restaurant-level operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA, when viewed with our results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations on page 50, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.  However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Also, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies. For the reconciliation between net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and the reconciliation of income from operations to Restaurant-Level EBITDA, see page 50.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income have important limitations as analytical tools. These limitations include the following:\n \u2022 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment; \n \u2022 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service principal or interest payments on our debt; \n \u2022 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets that we currently depreciate and amortize will likely have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to fund such replacements; and \n \u2022 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that our management does not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. However, some of these charges (such as impairment and other lease charges and acquisition costs) have recurred and may reoccur. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization primarily includes the depreciation of fixed assets, including equipment, owned buildings and leasehold improvements utilized in our restaurants, the amortization of franchise rights from our acquisitions of Burger King\u00ae restaurants and the amortization of franchise fees paid to BKC. \n \u2022 Impairment and other lease charges are determined through our assessment of the recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of these assets can be recovered over their respective remaining lives through undiscounted future operating cash flows. A potential impairment charge is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Losses on sale-leaseback transactions are recognized when they are incurred. Lease charges are recorded for our obligations under the related leases for closed locations net of estimated sublease recoveries. \n \u2022 Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our $275.0 million of 8% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 (the \"8% Notes\"), our prior 11.25% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2018 (the \"11.25% Notes\"), amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of bond premium and interest on revolving credit borrowings under our senior credit facility. \nRecent and Future Events Affecting our Results of Operations\nBurger King\u00ae Restaurant Acquisitions\nFrom the beginning of 2016 through December 30, 2018, we have acquired 164 restaurants from other franchisees, in the following transactions ($ in thousands):\n\n (1) Acquisitions resulting from the exercise of our ROFR.  All of the 2018 and 2017 acquired restaurants were leased properties. The 2016 acquired restaurants included 15 fee-owned properties, of which 14 were subsequently sold in sale-leaseback transactions in 2016 for net proceeds of $19.1 million.\nThe pro forma impact on the results of operations for the 2018 acquired restaurants is included below. The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of any future consolidated operating results. This pro forma financial information does not give effect to any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings or any transaction costs related to the 2018 acquired restaurants. The following table summarizes certain pro forma financial information related to our 2018 operating results:\n\nCapital Expenditures\nUnder the operating agreement with BKC, beginning on January 1, 2016 and until we exceed operating 1,000 Burger King\u00ae restaurants, a minimum of 10% of our annual new restaurant growth (including acquisitions) must come from the development of new Burger King\u00ae restaurants (which includes restaurants we relocate within their market area). At December 30, 2018, we were in compliance with this commitment.\nWithout giving effect to the Mergers and the Financing being consummated, in 2019, we expect that capital expenditures before discretionary growth-related expenditures (i.e. new restaurant development and acquisitions) will be $50 million to $60 million, although the actual amount of capital expenditures may differ from these estimates. Capital expenditures in 2019 include remodeling 20 to 25 restaurants to the BKC current image standard and upgrading 60 to 70 restaurants currently at the BKC 20/20 restaurant image to the exterior requirements of the Burger King of Tomorrow image including, but not limited to, landscaping, double drive-thru (where applicable), and exterior digital menu boards. We expect to receive a contribution from BKC of approximately $7.0 million to $8.0 million toward the upgrades to restaurants in 2019 whereby BKC is landlord on the lease, should the Area Development Agreement become effective. In addition, capital expenditures include the construction of 15 to 20 new units, of which 3 to 4 restaurants may be relocated within their respective markets. We will review on an ongoing basis our future remodel and development plans in relation to our available capital resources and alternate investment opportunities.\nFuture Restaurant Closures\nWe evaluate the performance of our restaurants on an ongoing basis including an assessment of the current and future operating results of the restaurant in relation to its cash flow and future occupancy costs, and with regard to franchise agreement renewals, the cost of required capital improvements. We may elect to close restaurants based on these evaluations.\nIn 2018, excluding one restaurant relocated within its trade area, we closed nine restaurants. We currently anticipate closing 8 to 12 restaurants in 2019, excluding any restaurants being relocated within their trade area, at the end of their respective lease term.\nOur determination of whether to close restaurants in the future is subject to further evaluation and may change. We may incur lease charges in the future from closures of underperforming restaurants prior to the expiration of their contractual lease term. We do not believe that the future impact on our results of operations due to restaurant closures will be material, although there can be no assurance in this regard.\nEffect of Tax law changes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which we refer to as the \"Act\", was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act made significant changes to the Federal tax code, including a reduction in the Federal income tax statutory rate from 35% to 21%. We recorded of a $0.8 million discrete tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 to remeasure our net deferred taxes due to the lowering of the Federal income tax statutory rate to 21%.\nEffect of Minimum Wage Increases\nCertain of the states and municipalities in which we operate have increased their minimum wage rates for 2018 and in many cases have also approved additional increases for future periods. Most notably, New York State has increased the minimum wage applicable to our business to $12.75 an hour in 2019 ($11.75 per hour in 2018, $10.75 per hour in 2017 and $9.75 an hour in 2016) with subsequent annual increases reaching $15.00 an hour by July 1, 2021. Since 2015 we have been receiving New York State minimum wage tax credits totaling approximately $500,000 per year that partially offset these additional labor costs. However, the New York State minimum wage tax credits expired in the beginning in 2019. We had 128 restaurants in New York State at December 30, 2018. We typically attempt to offset the effects of wage inflation, at least in part, through periodic menu price increases. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset these wage increases in the future.\nRefinancing of Indebtedness and Amendment to Our Senior Credit Facility\nOn June 23, 2017, we issued an additional $75 million principal amount of 8% Notes at a premium of 106.5% in a private placement and used a portion of the net proceeds to repay all of our revolving credit borrowings under our amended senior credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses. We received net proceeds of approximately $35.5 million from the offering which has been and will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including future restaurant acquisitions.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to increase the permitted indebtedness for our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million of 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017.\nAdditionally, on January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings by $18.0 million to a total of $73.0 million.\nSubsequent Events\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn November 30, 2018, Carrols Restaurant Group entered into a Preferred Stock Exchange Agreement whereby BKC exchanged 100 shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Carrols Restaurant Group held by BKC for 100 shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share newly issued by Carrols Restaurant Group. The powers, preferences and rights of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are substantially similar to those of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, that the shares are convertible into the same number of shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's Common Stock on an as-converted basis), except that the shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be transferred by BKC to certain other entities that are both affiliates of BKC and either Restaurant Brands International Inc. or Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership, each an indirect parent of BKC, without the termination of the rights that were previously granted solely to BKC under the Series A Preferred Stock. In connection with the Exchange, Carrols Restaurant Group issued 100 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to BKC and retired the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe Merger Agreement\nOn February 19, 2019, we agreed to purchase the business of the subsidiaries of Cambridge Franchise Holdings, LLC, which includes 166 Burger King\u00ae restaurants, 55 Popeyes\u00ae restaurants, six convenience stores and certain real property through a merger of Carrols CFP Merger Sub and New CFH in consideration of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share equal to 19.9% of outstanding shares of NewCRG Common Stock calculated immediately prior to the issuance of NewCRG Common Stock to Cambridge Holdings and 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. The consummation of the Cambridge Merger is subject to certain conditions and may be terminated, among other things, (i) by mutual consent of us and Cambridge Holdings, (ii) by us or Cambridge Holdings upon a breach of a representation and warranty in the Merger Agreement which has not been cured or (iii) if the closing of the transaction has not occurred on or prior to June 15, 2019.\nSeries C Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn connection with the closing of the Cambridge Merger, Cambridge Holdings will receive 10,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock shall (i) accrue a dividend of 9% per annum (accrued on a\ndaily basis) that will be payable by increasing the Stated Value per share of the Series C Preferred Stock every six months from the date of issuance, provided that if the Series C Preferred Stock is converted into NewCRG Common Stock prior to a Dividend Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid dividend since the date of the prior Dividend Payment Date shall be forfeited upon conversion, (ii) be subject to an Issuance Restriction, (iii) be initially convertible into a number of shares of NewCRG Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the difference of (A) the Equity Consideration Amount and (B) the product of (x) the number of NewCRG Investor Shares and (y) 13.5 and (2) 13.5, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution provisions and (iii) be automatically convertible into shares of NewCRG Common Stock upon Stockholder Approval (as defined below). The Equity Consideration Amount\u201d means the difference of (a) $200,000,000 and (b) the amount, if any, by which Net Debt (as defined in the Merger Agreement) exceeds $115,000,000. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the removal of the Issuance Restriction will be subject to obtaining the approval of NewCRG's stockholders at its next annual meeting of stockholders to be held after the closing of the transaction or at subsequent meetings of stockholders, if necessary, until the approval of NewCRG's stockholders is obtained.\nHolding Company Reorganization\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the completion of the Cambridge Merger, we will implement the Holding Company Reorganization, which will result in NewCRG owning all of the capital stock of Carrols Restaurant Group. NewCRG will initially be a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, Carrols Merger Sub, a newly formed entity and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group, will merge with and into Carrols Restaurant Group, with Carrols Restaurant Group surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG. Each share of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization will automatically be exchanged into an equivalent corresponding share of NewCRG Common Stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock being converted. Each share of Carrols Restaurant Group Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization will automatically be exchanged into an equivalent corresponding share of NewCRG Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Carrols Restaurant Group Series B Preferred Stock being converted. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Carrols Restaurant Group's current stockholders will become stockholders of NewCRG.\nFollowing the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the name of NewCRG will be changed to Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc.\u201d, the name of Carrols Restaurant Group will be changed to Carrols Holdco Inc.\u201d, and shares of NewCRG Common Stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the Carrols Restaurant Group's symbol TAST\u201d.\nArea Development and Remodeling Agreement\nWe have entered into an Area Development and Remodeling Agreement (the Area Development Agreement\u201d) which will be subject to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Mergers, and have a term commencing on, the date of the closing of the Merger Agreement, and ending on September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the Area Development Agreement, which will supersede the amended operating agreement, BKC will grant us franchise pre-approval and assign to us its right of first refusal on franchise restaurant transfers, in 16 states, which include Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia (subject to certain exceptions for certain limited geographic areas within certain states) until the date that Carrols LLC has acquired more than an aggregate of 500 Burger King Restaurants. The continued assignment of the ADA ROFR is subject to suspension or termination in the event of non-compliance by Carrols LLC with certain terms as set forth in the Area Development Agreement. Carrols LLC will pay BKC $3.0 million for the ADA ROFR payable in four equal installment payments in 2019.\nPursuant to the Area Development Agreement, Carrols LLC will agree to open, build and operate 200 new Burger King restaurants including 7 Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2019, 32 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2020, 41 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2021, 41 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 40 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023 and 39 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024. In addition, Carrols LLC will agree to remodel or upgrade 748 Burger\nKing restaurants to BKC's Burger King of Tomorrow restaurant image, including 90 Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2019, 130 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2020, 118 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2021, 131 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 138 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023 and 141 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024, which will include a contribution by BKC of $10 million to $12 million for upgrades of approximately 50 to 60 Burger King restaurants in 2019 and 2020 where BKC is the landlord on the lease.\nOn October 1 of each year following the commencement date of the Area Development Agreement, Carrols LLC will pay BKC pre-paid franchise fees in the following amounts which will be applied to new Burger King restaurants opened and operated by us: (a) $350,000 on the commencement date of the Area Development Agreement, (b) $1,600,000 on October 1, 2019, (c) $2,050,000 on October 1, 2020, (d) $2,050,000 on October 1, 2021, (e) $2,000,000 on October 1, 2022 and (f) $1,950,000 on October 1, 2023.\nCommitment Letter\nIn connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement, we entered into the Commitment Letter with Wells Fargo Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, Rabobank, M&T Bank, SunTrust Bank and STRH pursuant to which Wells Fargo Bank, Rabobank, M&T Bank, and SunTrust Bank committed to provide $500.0 million in debt financing to our new subsidiary, NewCRG.\nPursuant to which and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, the Lenders have committed to provide to NewCRG, substantially contemporaneously with the consummation of the Mergers, senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million, consisting of (i) a term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the Term Loan B Facility\u201d) and (ii) a revolving credit facility (including a sub-facility for standby letters of credit) in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the New Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan B Facility, the New Senior Credit Facilities\u201d), all on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter.\nThe proceeds of the Term Loan B Facility will be used to refinance the existing indebtedness of (i) Carrols Restaurant Group and (ii) New CFH and its subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent provided in the Commitment Letter and the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Commitment Letter. The proceeds of the New Revolving Credit Facility will be used to finance (i) the Refinancing, (ii) the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes of NewCRG and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions and required expenditures under development agreements.\nThe obligation of the Lenders to provide the Financing is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, (i) the consummation of the Mergers substantially contemporaneously with the initial funding of the New Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) the accuracy of certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, as well as certain other specified representations of NewCRG that are customary for a loan facility of this type, (iii) execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the Commitment Letter with respect to the New Senior Credit Facilities, (iv) delivery of certain customary closing documents (including, among others, a customary solvency certificate), specified items of collateral and certain financial statements, all as more fully described in the Commitment Letter, (v) payment of applicable fees and expenses, (vi) receipt of one or more customary confidential information memoranda to be used for syndication of the New Senior Credit Facilities and the expiration of a 15 business day period following delivery of such Confidential information memorandum, and (vii) that there has been no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) since the date of the Merger Agreement.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and to Fiscal 2016\nThe following table highlights the key components of sales and the number of restaurants in operation for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1) New restaurants opened in 2018 include two restaurants relocated within their market area and restaurants closed include one restaurant closed as result of relocation.\nRestaurant Sales. Total restaurant sales in 2018 increased 8.3% to $1,179.3 million from $1,088.5 million in 2017. Comparable restaurant sales increased 3.8% due to an increase in average check of 2.8% and an increase in customer traffic of 1.0%. The effect of menu price increases in 2018 was approximately 2.5%. Restaurant sales also increased $25.4 million from the full year impact of restaurants acquired in 2017, restaurant sales of $16.9 million from the acquisition of 44 restaurants during 2018 and sales of $18.8 million from the opening of new restaurants since the end of 2017.\nTotal restaurant sales in 2017 increased 15.4% to $1,088.5 million and included a comparable restaurant sales increase of 5.2% driven by an increase in average check of 4.0% and an increase in customer traffic of 1.2%. The effect of menu price increases in 2017 was approximately 2.3%. Restaurant sales also increased due to the 64 restaurants acquired since the beginning of 2017.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017 selected operating results as a percentage of total restaurant sales:\n\nOperating Costs and Expenses (percentages stated as a percentage of total restaurant sales unless otherwise noted). Cost of sales decreased to 27.7% in 2018 from 28.0% in 2017 due primarily to the favorable impact of menu price increases (0.8%) and lower commodity costs (0.3%), which included a 4.9% decrease in beef prices compared to the prior year, offset in part by the effect of higher promotional discounting (0.8%).\nCost of sales increased to 28.0% in 2017 from 26.5% in 2016 due primarily to higher commodity costs (1.1%), which included a 9.4% increase in beef prices compared to 2016, higher promotional discounting (0.6%) and the\nnegative impact of changes in product mix offset in part by the effect of menu price increases (0.7%) and the continued improvement in restaurant-level food and cash controls at our acquired restaurants.\nRestaurant wages and related expenses increased to 32.5% in 2018 from 32.2% in 2017 due to wage inflation increasing hourly labor rates, including the effect of minimum wage increases. The increase in restaurant wages and related expenses to 32.2% in 2017 from 31.6% in 2016 was also due to higher hourly labor rates.\nRestaurant rent expense decreased slightly to 6.9% in 2018 from 7.0% in 2017 primarily due to leveraging of fixed rentals on the increased restaurant sales. Restaurant rent expense increased slightly to 7.0% in 2017 from 6.9% in 2016 primarily due to incremental rent from sale-leaseback transactions completed in 2016 offset partially by leveraging of rent on the sales increases.\nOther restaurant operating expenses decreased slightly to 15.2% in 2018 from 15.3% in 2017 and 15.8% in 2016. This reduction is due primarily to leveraging of our fixed operating costs, including utilities and repair and maintenance expense, on higher sales volumes.\nAdvertising expense was 4.1% in both 2018 and 2017. Advertising expense decreased to 4.1% in 2017 from 4.4% in 2016 due to a reduction in local advertising spending in certain of our markets in 2017 from the prior year.\nRestaurant-Level EBITDA. As a result of the factors above Restaurant-Level EBITDA increased 10.4% to $161.7 million in 2018 compared to $146.5 million in 2017 and $140.6 million in 2016. For a reconciliation between Restaurant-Level EBITDA and income from operations see page 50.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $66.6 million in 2018 compared to $60.3 million in 2017, and increased as a percentage of total restaurant sales, from 5.5% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2018. General and administrative expenses increased in dollars during 2018 from additional field management and restaurant manager training costs related to our acquisitions, growth to support our restaurant development and technology initiatives, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million primarily from stock awards granted in 2018 and an increase of $2.2 million in incentive compensation accruals based on our operating results in relation to our plan in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $5.3 million in 2017 to $60.3 million compared to $55.0 million in 2016, and decreased as a percentage of total restaurant sales, from 5.8% in 2016 to 5.5% in 2017. The increase in total general and administrative expenses during 2017 was driven by additional field management and restaurant manager training costs related to the 2017 and 2016 acquisitions and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million from stock awards granted in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in incentive compensation accruals based on our operating results in relation to our plan in 2017 versus 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. As a result of the factors above Adjusted EBITDA increased $10.9 million or 11.9% to $102.3 million in 2018 from $91.4 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.1% in 2017 from $89.5 million in 2016.\nFor a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA see page 50.\nDepreciation and Amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense to $58.5 million in 2018 from $54.2 million in 2017 was primarily due to our ongoing new development, restaurant remodeling initiatives and depreciation and amortization expense related to our acquisition of restaurants in 2017 and 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.9 million during 2017 from $47.3 million in 2016 due to our capital spending on restaurant remodeling and depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the 2016 and 2017 acquisitions.\nImpairment and Other Lease Charges. We recorded impairment and other lease charges of $3.7 million consisting of $0.4 million of capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $0.4 million related to initial impairment charges for six underperforming restaurants, $1.9 million related to the write-off of defective product holding unit kitchen equipment that was replaced, losses of $0.8 million associated with sale-leaseback transactions of four restaurant properties, and other lease charges of $0.2 million.\nWe recorded impairment and other lease charges of $2.8 million in 2017 and included $0.7 million of capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $1.1 million related to initial impairment charges for five underperforming restaurants, $0.9 million of other lease charges primarily due to four restaurants and an administrative office closed during the period and losses of $0.1 million associated with the sale-leaseback of one restaurant property.\nWe recorded impairment and other lease charges during 2016 of $2.4 million including $0.9 million for capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $0.2 million related to initial impairment charges for four underperforming restaurants and losses of $1.2 million associated with the sale-leaseback of seven restaurant properties.\nOther Income and Expense. In 2018, we recorded a gain of $0.4 million related to an insurance recovery from a fire at one restaurant. In 2017, we recorded a net $0.3 million gain primarily related to an insurance recovery from a fire at one restaurant. In 2016, we had a gain of $1.2 million related to insurance recoveries from fires at two restaurants, a gain of $0.5 million related to a settlement for a partial condemnation of one of our operating restaurant properties, and an expense of $1.85 million related to a litigation settlement with our former Chairman and CEO.\nInterest Expense. The increase in interest expense to $23.6 million in 2018 from $21.7 million in 2017 and $18.3 million in 2016 is primarily the result of the issuance of an additional $75.0 million principal amount of 8.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 on June 23, 2017. This increase was offset in part by $0.9 million and $0.5 million of bond premium amortization in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt, excluding lease financing obligations, was 7.9% in 2018, 7.7% in 2017 and 7.9% in 2016.\nIncome Taxes. In 2018, we recorded an income tax benefit as the effect of wage tax credits, which are a large component of offsetting deferred tax assets, more than offset the federal income tax provision at the statutory rate as these credits are not directly related to the amount of pretax income reported for the year.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017, excluding discrete items, was 8.2% and is lower than the statutory rate due to the effect of fixed tax credits relative to our 2017 pretax income as the benefits of these credits are not directly related to the amount of pretax income reported in the period. We also recorded a $0.8 million discrete tax benefit in the fourth quarter to remeasure our net deferred taxes due to the lowering of the Federal statutory income tax rate to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nIn 2016, we reversed the valuation allowance on all of our net deferred income tax assets resulting in a tax benefit of $30.4 million. Excluding the valuation allowance reversal, we recorded a provision for income taxes in 2016 of $2.3 million. The 2016 effective tax rate of 13.2%, exclusive of the valuation allowance reversal, is lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to employment tax credits.\nNet Income. As a result of the above, net income was $10.1 million in 2018, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.2 million in 2017, or $0.16 per diluted share and net income of $45.5 million in 2016, or $1.01 per diluted share.\nReconciliations of net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and income from operations to Restaurant-Level EBITDA for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):\n\n\n\n (1) Acquisition costs included in general and administrative expense primarily include legal and professional fees incurred in connection with restaurant acquisitions, and in 2017, certain payroll and other costs associated with the wind-down of the corporate headquarters from the acquisition of Republic Foods, Inc. \n (2) The year ended December 30, 2018 includes a gain of $0.4 million related to an insurance recovery from a fire at one of our restaurants. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes a gain of $0.4 million related to an insurance recovery from a fire at one of our restaurants. The year ended January 1, 2017 includes gains of $1.2 million related to insurance recoveries from fires at two of our restaurants and a gain of $0.5 million related to a settlement for a partial condemnation on one of our operating restaurant properties. \n (3) Includes an expense of $1.85 million related to a litigation settlement. \n (4) The income tax effect related to the adjustments (other than the deferred income tax adjustment) was calculated using an effective income tax rate of 22.2% for the year ended December 30, 2018 and 38% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017. \n (5) The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2017 reflects a $0.8 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter to to remeasure our net deferred taxes due to the lowering of the Federal income tax rate to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in the fourth quarter of 2017. The benefit for income taxes in 2016 reflects a $30.4 million income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 to reverse the previously recorded valuation allowance on net deferred income tax assets as well as the full year deferred income tax provision of $2.3 million which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n (6) Adjusted diluted net income per share is calculated based on Adjusted net income and the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective periods. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to acquire additional restaurants, develop new restaurants, enhance existing restaurants and to reduce debt.\nInterest payments under our debt obligations, capital expenditures, including our new restaurant development and restaurant remodeling initiatives in 2019, payments of royalties and advertising to BKC and payments related to our lease obligations represent significant liquidity requirements for us as well as any discretionary expenditures for the acquisition of additional Burger King\u00ae restaurants. We believe cash generated from our operations, our cash balances and availability of revolving credit borrowings under our amended senior credit facility will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the permitted indebtedness of our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million of the 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017. On January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings by $18.0 million to a total of $73.0 million.\nAs is common in the restaurant industry, we maintain relatively low levels of account receivables and inventories and receive trade credit based upon negotiated terms for purchasing food products and other supplies. As a result, we may at times maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets, which results in a working capital deficit. We are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because:\n \u2022 restaurant operations are primarily conducted on a cash basis; \n \u2022 rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories; and \n \u2022 cash from restaurant sales is usually received before related liabilities for food, supplies and payroll become due.  Operating activities. Net cash provided from operating activities for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 was $80.8 million, $72.8 million and $62.3 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased by $8.0 million compared to 2017 due primarily to higher net income and depreciation.\nNet cash provided from operating activities in 2017 increased by $10.5 million compared to 2016 due primarily an increase from the changes in the components of working capital of $10.3 million.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 was $106.9 million, $108.1 million and $96.2 million, respectively. Net cash used for investing activities decreased $1.2 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily\ndue to higher proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. Net cash used for investing activities increased $11.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sale-leaseback proceeds of $49.3 million offset in part by lower acquisition and capital spending.\nCapital expenditures are a large component of our investing activities and include: (1) new restaurant development, which may include the purchase of real estate; (2) restaurant remodeling, which includes the renovation or rebuilding of the interior and exterior of our existing restaurants including expenses associated with our franchise agreement renewals and certain restaurants that we acquire; (3) other restaurant capital expenditures, which include capital maintenance expenditures for the ongoing reinvestment and enhancement of our restaurants, and from time to time, to support BKC's initiatives; and (4) corporate and restaurant information systems, including expenditures for our point-of-sale software for restaurants that we acquire.\nThe following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nAs discussed above, in 2018, we acquired 44 restaurants in four transactions for a total cash purchase price of $38.1 million. In 2017, we acquired 64 restaurants in three transactions for a total cash purchase price of $37.9 million. In 2016, we acquired 56 restaurants in seven transactions for a total cash purchase price of $48.1 million.\nInvesting activities also included sale-leaseback transactions related to our restaurant properties. In 2018, these transactions primarily related to land purchases and new restaurant construction. In 2017 and 2016 the sale-leaseback transactions were primarily fee-owned properties acquired in restaurant acquisitions. The proceeds were $8.4 million in 2018, $4.3 million in 2017 and $53.6 million in 2016 and were used to fund our new development and remodeling initiatives, acquisition of restaurants and other cash requirements.\nWe also had expenditures related to the purchase of restaurant properties to be sold in sale-leaseback transactions of $2.1 million in 2018, $1.4 million in 2017 and $9.0 million in 2016.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 was $0.7 million due primarily to principal payments on capital leases of $1.8 million and proceeds from lease financing obligations of $2.7 million.\nNet cash provided from financing activities in 2017 was $62.7 million due primarily to proceeds of $79.9 million from the issuance of the additional $75.0 million principal amount of 8% Notes at a premium offset by the net repayment of revolving credit borrowings of $13.5 million and principal payments on capital leases of $1.7 million.\n8% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. The $275 million principal amount of 8% Notes mature on May 1, 2022. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. The 8% Notes are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and are secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets (including a pledge of all of the capital stock and equity interests of our subsidiaries).\nThe 8% Notes are redeemable at our option in whole or in part at any time after May 1, 2018 at a price of 104% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed before May 1, 2019, 102% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed after May 1, 2019 but before May 1, 2020 and 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if redeemed after May 1, 2020.\nThe 8% Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed, unconditionally and in full by our subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly 100% owned by us. Separate condensed consolidating information is not included because Carrols Restaurant Group is a holding company that has no independent assets or operations. There are no significant restrictions on our ability or any of the guarantor subsidiaries' ability to obtain funds from its respective subsidiaries. All consolidated amounts in our financial statements are representative of the combined guarantors.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes includes certain covenants, including limitations and restrictions on our and our subsidiaries who are guarantors under such indenture to, among other things: incur indebtedness or issue preferred stock; incur liens; pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; sell assets; agree to payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries; enter into transaction with affiliates; or merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance as of December 30, 2018 with the restrictive covenants of the indenture governing the 8% Notes.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes and the security agreement provide that any capital stock and equity interests of any of our subsidiaries will be excluded from the collateral to the extent that the par value, book value or market value of such capital stock or equity interests exceeds 20% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8% Notes then outstanding.\nThe indenture governing the 8% Notes contains customary default provisions, including without limitation, a cross default provision pursuant to which it is an event of default under the 8% Notes and the indenture governing the 8% Notes if there is a default under any of our indebtedness having an outstanding principal amount of $20.0 million or more which results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its stated maturity or is caused by a failure to pay principal when due.\nSenior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2012, we entered into a senior credit facility, which was most recently amended on June 20, 2017 to increase the permitted indebtedness of our second lien notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million principal amount of the 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017. On January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum revolving credit borrowings to $73.0 million (including $20.0 million available for letters of credit). The amended senior credit facility also provides for potential incremental borrowing increases of up to $25.0 million, in the aggregate, and will mature on February 12, 2021.\nAt December 30, 2018 there were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding and $11.6 million of letters of credit were issued under the amended senior credit facility. After reserving for issued letters of credit, $61.4 million was available for revolving credit borrowings under the amended senior credit facility at December 30, 2018.\nBorrowings under the amended senior credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, based on (all terms as defined in our amended senior credit facility):\n(i) the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin of 1.75% to 2.75% based on the our Adjusted Leverage Ratio, or\n(ii) the LIBOR Rate plus the applicable margin of 2.75% to 3.75% based on the our Adjusted Leverage Ratio.\nAt December 30, 2018, our Alternate Base Rate margin was 1.75% and our LIBOR Rate margin was 2.75% based on our Adjusted Leverage Ratio.\nOur obligations under the amended senior credit facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries, including a pledge of all of the capital stock and equity interests of our subsidiaries.\nUnder the amended senior credit facility, we are required to make mandatory prepayments of borrowings in the event of dispositions of assets, debt issuances and insurance and condemnation proceeds (all subject to certain exceptions).\nThe amended senior credit facility contains certain covenants, including without limitation, those limiting our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the character of its business in all material respects, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments, make certain restricted payments or pay dividends. In addition, the amended senior credit facility requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Adjusted Leverage Ratio and First Lien Leverage Ratio (all as defined under the amended senior credit facility). We were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility at December 30, 2018.\nThe amended senior credit facility contains customary default provisions, including that the lenders may terminate their obligation to advance and may declare the unpaid balance of borrowings, or any part thereof, immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of customary defaults which include, without limitation, payment default, covenant defaults, bankruptcy type defaults, cross-defaults on other indebtedness, judgments or upon the occurrence of a change of control.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 30, 2018 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Our long term debt at December 30, 2018 included $275.0 million of 8% Notes. Total interest payments on our Notes of $77.0 million for all years presented are included at the coupon rate of 8%. \n (2) Includes total interest of $0.4 million for all years presented. \n (3) Represents the aggregate minimum lease payments under operating leases. Many of our leases also require contingent rent based on a percentage of sales in addition to the minimum base rent and require expenses incidental to the use of the property all of which have been excluded from this table. \n (4) Includes total interest of $0.5 million for all years presented.  We have not included obligations under our postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table as our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance, but is funded as retiree medical claims are paid. Also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers' compensation, general liability and employee healthcare claims for which we pay all claims, subject to annual stop-loss limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate. The majority of our recorded liabilities related to self-insured employee health and insurance plans represent estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. The total of these liabilities was $8.5 million at December 30, 2018.\nFuture restaurant remodeling obligations to BKC have also been excluded from the table above as well as contractual obligations related to royalties and advertising payable to BKC.\nLong-Term Debt Obligations. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for details of our long-term debt.\nLease Guarantees. Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. (\"Fiesta\"), our former wholly-owned subsidiary, was spun-off in 2012 to our stockholders. As of December 30, 2018, we are a guarantor under 27 Fiesta restaurant property leases, of which all except for one are still operating, with lease terms expiring on various dates through 2030. We are the\nprimary lessee on five Fiesta restaurant property leases, which we sublease to Fiesta. We are fully liable for all obligations under the terms of the leases in the event that Fiesta fails to pay any sums due under the lease, subject to indemnification provisions of the separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin-off.\nThe maximum potential liability for future rental payments we could be required to make under these leases at December 30, 2018 was $16.3 million. The obligations under these leases will generally continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire. No payments have been made to date and none are expected to be required to be made in the future. We have not recorded a liability for those guarantees in accordance with ASC 460 - Guarantees as Fiesta has indemnified us for all such obligations and we did not believe it was probable we would be required to perform under any of the guarantees or direct obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than our operating leases, which are primarily for our restaurant properties and not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nInflation\nThe inflationary factors that have historically affected our results of operations include increases in food and paper costs, labor and other operating expenses, the cost of providing medical and prescription drug insurance to our employees and energy costs. Wages paid in our restaurants are impacted by changes in the Federal and state hourly minimum wage rates and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Accordingly, changes in the Federal and state hourly minimum wage rates directly affect our labor costs. We typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation, at least in part, through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Significant Accounting Policies\u201d footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.\nSales recognition at our restaurants is straightforward as customers pay for products at the time of sale and inventory turns over very quickly. Payments to vendors for products sold in the restaurants are generally settled within 30 days. The earnings reporting process is covered by our system of internal controls and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments. However, critical accounting estimates and judgments, as noted below, are inherent in the assessment and recording of the fair market values of acquired restaurant assets and liabilities, insurance liabilities, the valuation of deferred income tax assets, assessing impairment of long-lived assets and lease accounting matters. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions.\nAcquisition Accounting. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, \"Business Combinations\" (\"ASC 805\"). As required by ASC 805, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their respective fair values as of the business combination date. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, favorable and unfavorable leases and intangible assets. We use available information to make these fair value determinations and, when necessary, engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of favorable or unfavorable leases and intangible assets.\nInsurance Liabilities. The amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and medical insurance claims under policies where we pay all claims, subject to annual stop-loss insurance limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate. We record insurance\nliabilities based on historical trends, which are continually monitored, and adjust accruals as warranted by changing circumstances. Since there are estimates and assumptions inherent in recording these insurance liabilities, including the ability to estimate the future development of incurred claims based on historical claims experience and loss reserves, current claim data, and the severity of the claims, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities. As of December 30, 2018, we had $8.5 million accrued for these insurance claims.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We assess the potential impairment of long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine if there is an impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our restaurants. If assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In determining future cash flows, significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term, including sales trends, labor rates, commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions which can be impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. Our fair value estimates are also subject to a high degree of judgment, including our ability to sell the related assets and changing market conditions. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary from those estimates used, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future.\nLease Accounting. Judgments made by management for our lease obligations include the length of the lease term, which includes the determination of renewal options that are reasonably assured. The lease term can affect the classification of a lease as capital or operating for accounting purposes, the term over which related leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized, and any rent holidays and/or changes in rental amounts for recognizing rent expense over the term of the lease. These judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used.\nWe also must evaluate sales of our restaurants which occur in sale-leaseback transactions to determine the proper accounting for the proceeds of such sales either as a sale or a financing. This evaluation requires certain judgments in determining whether clauses in the lease or any related agreements constitute continuing involvement. For those sale-leasebacks that are accounted for as financing transactions, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate, or another rate in cases where the incremental borrowing rate is not appropriate to utilize, for purposes of determining interest expense and the resulting amortization of the lease financing obligation. Changes in the determination of the incremental borrowing rates or other rates utilized in connection with the accounting for lease financing transactions could have a significant effect on the interest expense and underlying balance of the lease financing obligations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
