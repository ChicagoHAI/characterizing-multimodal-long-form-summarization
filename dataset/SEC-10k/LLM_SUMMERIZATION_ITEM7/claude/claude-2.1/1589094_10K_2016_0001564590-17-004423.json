As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of this report captioned Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should read the following discussion and analysis together with the audited financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. Throughout this discussion and analysis we refer to our years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, as 2016,\u201d 2015\u201d and 2014.\u201d\nOverview\nAs a leading provider of domain name services, we enable businesses and consumers to find, establish, and maintain their digital address-the starting point for connecting with their online audience. Millions of digital destinations, and businesses and consumers rely upon our comprehensive platform for the discovery, registration, usage and monetization of domain names. As a result, we are a leader in the multi-billion dollar domain name services industry, with a complete suite of services that our customers use as the foundation to build their entire online presence.\nOn January 20, 2017, we completed the divestiture (the eNom Divestiture\u201d) of eNom, Incorporated ( eNom\u201d), our wholly-owned registrar services business, to Tucows Inc. ( Tucows\u201d). eNom's registrar services business provides infrastructure services that enable a network of active resellers to offer domain name registration services to their customers. As part of the eNom Divestiture, Tucows also acquired eNom's interest in its joint venture with Web.com for NameJet, LLC ( NameJet\u201d), which offers domain name auction services to consumers. All references made to financial data, non-financial metrics and our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to the Company's continuing operations (after giving effect to the eNom Divestiture), unless specifically noted. eNom's revenue was $155.8 million for 2016. See Note 3-Business Divestiture within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe are a leading domain name registry with a portfolio of 40 gTLDs acquired from ICANN's New gTLD Program. To date, we have launched all 40 of our gTLDs into the market, including .LIVE, .NEWS, and .ROCKS. Our registry services business continues to build a diverse distribution network of over 135 ICANN accredited registrars, including Name.com, eNom and GoDaddy, as well as other complementary distribution partners such as website builders and email service providers that offer our gTLD domain names to businesses and consumers. Furthermore, our distribution network includes registrars and other partners in international markets, positioning our company to capture additional sales on a global scale. In addition to operating our own registry, we provide technical back-end infrastructure services to Donuts, a third-party operator of new gTLDs (collectively with the New gTLD Program, our gTLD Initiative\u201d).\nOur retail registrar, Name.com, directly offers domain name registration services to more than 248,000 consumers and businesses worldwide. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2.1 million domain names under management. Our domain name registration and related services, as well as our developed proprietary tools and services enable us to identify and acquire, as well as monetize and sell, domain names, both for our own portfolio of domain names as well as for our customers' domain names.\nThe combination of our registry and registrar services businesses makes us a leading provider of end-to-end domain name services. This uniquely positions us to capitalize on the New gTLD Program because we can distribute owned and third-party gTLDs through our retail registrar brand, Name.com, and our third-party registrar distribution channel.\nWe generate revenue through domain name registration subscriptions, including registrations of domain names for our owned gTLDs, and related value-added services. We also generate revenue from advertising on, and from the sale of, domain names that are registered to our customers or ourselves. Our business model is characterized by non-refundable, up-front payments, which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow. We had revenue of $62.1 million, net loss of $33.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million for 2016; compared to revenue of $57.4 million, net loss of $11.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million for 2015.\nSeparation from Demand Media\nPrior to August 1, 2014, Rightside was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Demand Media. On August 1, 2014, Demand Media completed a tax-free transaction involving the distribution of all outstanding shares of Rightside common stock to holders of Demand Media common stock as of the record date. Upon the Separation, holders of Demand Media common stock on the record date received one share of Rightside common stock for every five shares of Demand Media common stock. Rightside became an independent, publicly-traded company on the NASDAQ using the symbol: NAME.\u201d\nWe had agreements with Demand Media that impacted our results of operations and financial condition. This included a Transition Services Agreement (the TSA\u201d) and Tax Matters Agreement. Under the TSA, Demand Media provided us with certain financial, administrative, and accounting-related support and systems. The transition services were completed in February 2016.\nOur ability to raise equity capital is subject to the restrictions in the Tax Matters Agreement, which requires us to comply with the representations made in the IRS private letter ruling or in materials submitted to the IRS and our tax counsel in connection with the Separation. These representations contain restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the Separation to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including entering into any transaction or series of transactions as a results of which any person or group of persons would acquire or have the right to acquire from us or stockholders our stock greater than certain threshold amounts, or issuing our stock in an offering in amounts greater than certain threshold amounts. Some of these restrictions will apply for the two-year period after the Separation. If the Separation fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be responsible for taxes arising from the actions that cause the Separation to not qualify as tax-free.\nFull Year 2016 Highlights\nBelow are our key highlights as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. All comparisons are relative to the fiscal full year 2015.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total revenue was $62.1 million compared to $57.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Registry services revenue increased 40% to $11.8 million from $8.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Registrar services revenue increased 17% to $29.1 million from $24.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net loss was $33.7 million compared to $11.3 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $9.2 million compared to $4.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Cash and cash equivalents were $31.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fully repaid and extinguished our term loan credit facility with Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC on November 7, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $12.8 million draw on the revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank on November 4, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOpportunities, Challenges and Risks\nOur revenue is derived from domain name registrations and related value-added service subscriptions from our retail customers of our registrar platform, as well as from our Aftermarket and other services business. Over the past few years our revenue growth has been driven by strong growth in Name.com, our leading retail registrar, and significant growth from our Registry services business since launch in the first quarter of 2014. Going forward, we expect growth in our Registry services business as we narrow our focus on this faster growing, stronger margin and more profitable business.\nGrowth in revenue from our Registrar services business is dependent upon our ability to attract retail customers to our registrar platform, to sustain those recurring revenue relationships by maintaining consistent domain name registration and value-added service renewal rates and to grow those relationships through competitive pricing on domain name registrations, differentiated value-added services and customer service offerings. We also generate advertising revenue through our monetization platform for websites or domain names that we or our customers own. Going forward, we expect downward pressure on the revenue associated with these websites as we continue to see low traffic and advertising yields in the marketplace.\nWe received returns of deposits of $3.1 million, and made payments and deposits of $9.7 million and $32.0 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for gTLD applications under the New gTLD Program. These payments and deposits represent amounts paid directly to ICANN and third parties in the pursuit of certain exclusive gTLD operator rights. We capitalize payments made for gTLD applications and other acquisition related costs, and include them in other long-term assets and intangible assets on the balance sheets. As part of the New gTLD Program, we have received partial cash refunds for certain gTLD applications and to the extent we elect to sell or withdraw certain gTLD applications throughout the process, we will continue to incur gains or losses on amounts invested. Gains on the sale of our interest in gTLDs applications are recognized when realized, while losses are recognized when deemed probable. Upon the delegation of operator rights for each gTLD by ICANN, gTLD application fees and other acquisition-related costs are reclassified as finite-lived intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. We expense as incurred other costs incurred as part of this gTLD Initiative and not directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD operator rights.\nOur cost of revenue, which is the largest component of our operating expenses, can vary from period to period, particularly as a percentage of revenue. With the recent revenue growth coming from the sales of our higher margin Registry services business and the realization of pricing optimization initiatives launched in early 2016, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has decreased in 2016 compared to 2015.\nOur marketing expense has grown in recent years as we have promoted our Name.com retail registrar and the New gTLD Program. Marketing activity primarily flows through our sales and marketing expense line item. Although to the extent that our registry offers performance incentive rebates or other business incentives to our partners, those incentives are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nOver the long term, we expect our overall revenue to increase as the Registry services business becomes a larger contributor to our overall revenue mix. In addition, we are driving initiatives in the area of price optimization and other operating cost reduction programs that we believe will further expand our direct profit in the Registrar services business.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe review a number of business metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our Registry and Registrar services businesses, measure the performance of our business model, identify trends impacting our business, determine resource allocations, formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions.\nWe believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our performance:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Domain: We define a domain as an individual domain name registered by a third-party customer on Rightside's registry or registrar platform for which Rightside has begun to recognize revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Average revenue per domain ( ARPD\u201d): We calculate Registry ARPD by dividing Registry services revenue for a period by the average number of domains registered on Rightside's registry platform in that period.

ARPD for partial year periods is annualized.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Renewal rate: We define the renewal rate as the percentage of domain names on our registry or registrar platform that are renewed after their original term expires.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegistry Services Metrics\nThe following table sets forth performance highlights of key business metrics for our Registry services for the periods presented (in thousands, except for per domain and percentage data):\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> End of period domains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 169.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per domain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Renewal rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegistrar Services Metrics\nThe following table sets forth performance highlights of key business metrics for our Registrar services for the periods presented (in millions, except for per domain and percentage data):\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> End of period domains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per domain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Renewal rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Revenue per Domain\nThe Registry average revenue per domain for 2016 decreased 20.5% to $24.40 from $30.69 in 2015. The Registry average revenue per domain for 2015 increased 19.1% to $30.69 from $25.76 in 2014. The increase in 2015 was driven primarily by premium sales and launch related fees.\nThe Registrar average revenue per domain for 2016 increased 9.5% to $15.84 from $14.46 in 2015. The Registrar average revenue per domain for 2015 increased 9.5% to $14.46 from $13.20 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to our profitability initiatives, as well as an increasing mix of higher margin new gTLDs, which have an average selling price approximately two to three times that of legacy gTLDs.\nRenewal Rate\nThe Registry renewal rate for 2016 was 56.3% compared to 58.6% in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to promotional units renewing at a lower rate.\nThe Registrar renewal rate for 2016 was 68.4% compared to 70.5% in 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by churn of customers with higher domains under management.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is principally comprised of registration fees charged to businesses and consumers in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations, including registrations of domain names for our own gTLDs. In addition, our registrar also generates revenue from the sale of other value-added services that are designed to help our customers easily build, enhance and protect their domain names, including security services, email accounts and web hosting, and the performance of services for registries. Finally, we generate advertising and domain name sales revenue as part of our aftermarket service offering. We generate this aftermarket revenue on domain names that we own, as well as by providing these services to third parties. Our revenue varies based upon the number of domain names registered or utilizing our aftermarket service offerings, the rates we charge our customers, our ability to sell value-added services, our ability to sell domain names from our portfolio, and the monetization we are able to achieve through our aftermarket service offerings. Performance incentive rebates and certain other business incentives are recognized as a reduction in revenue. We primarily market our retail registration services under our Name.com brand.\nOur revenue also includes registration fees from our portfolio of 40 gTLDs in general availability for which we are the exclusive registry operator, as part of the gTLD Initiative. The amount as well as the timing of revenue is uncertain and is dependent upon the demand and level of user adoption of new gTLDs, the timing and number of our back-end registry customers' launches of gTLDs, and the continued progress of the New gTLD Program. To the extent that our registry offers performance incentive rebates or certain other business incentives to our partners, those incentives are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs we incur with selling an incremental product to our customers. Substantially all cost of revenue relates to domain name registration costs, payment processing fees, third-party commissions and customer care. Similar to our billing practices, we pay domain costs at the time of purchase, but recognize the costs of service ratably over the life of the registration. Customer care expense represents the costs to consult, advise and service our customers' needs. Customer care expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) and are expensed as incurred. We expect cost of revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in future periods as we experience continued downward pressure on the revenue from our domain name monetization platform. Domain name costs include fees paid to the various domain registries and ICANN. We prepay these costs in advance for the life of the registration. The terms of registry pricing are established by an agreement between registries and registrars. Cost of revenue may increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue, depending on the mix of products sold in a particular period and the sales and marketing channels used.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing consists primarily of sales and marketing personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense), sales support, advertising, marketing and general promotional expenditures. We anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development consists primarily of costs associated with creation, development and distribution of our products and websites. These expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) associated with the design, development, deployment, testing, operation and enhancement of our products, as well as costs associated with the data centers and systems infrastructure supporting those products. Technology and development expenses may increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue depending on our level of investment in future headcount and global infrastructure footprint. We anticipate that our technology and development expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative consists primarily of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) from our executive, legal, finance, human resources and information technology organizations and facilities-related expenditures, as well as third-party professional fees, and insurance expenses. Professional fees are largely comprised of outside legal, audit and information technology consulting. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation expense consists of charges relating to the depreciation of the property and equipment used in our business. Depreciation expense may increase or decrease in absolute dollars in future periods depending on the future level of capital investments in hardware and other equipment. We expect the depreciation of property and equipment to remain relatively flat in the near term.\nAmortization expense consists of charges relating to the amortization of capitalized identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of domain names, including initial registration costs, as well as costs to acquire gTLDs, and intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the related expected useful lives of these assets. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on its historical experience of intangible assets of similar quality and value. We capitalize gTLD assets once they become available for their intended use and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the remaining contractual period of the registry operator agreement, which is approximately 10 years. We expect the amortization of intangible assets to remain relatively flat in the near term.\n(Gain) Loss on Other Assets, Net\n(Gain) loss on other assets, net consists of gains and losses on withdrawals or settlement of costs related to our interest in certain gTLD applications, as well as other sales of assets. We expect our gains and losses will vary depending upon potential gains or losses resulting from our resolution of gTLD applications for which there were multiple bidders.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense on our credit facilities. Interest expense includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount. We expect interest expense to significantly decrease in the near term, as we extinguished our debt and reduced our outstanding letters of credit. Please refer to Note 9-Debt and Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on the extinguishment of this debt.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net, consists primarily of realized gains related to the sale of marketable securities, transaction gains and losses on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and interest income.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes principally in the United States, and certain other countries where we have a legal presence, including Ireland, Canada and Cayman Islands. We anticipate that as we expand our operations outside the United States, we will become subject to taxation based on foreign statutory rates, and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates on income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nBasis of Presentation\nRefer to Note 1-Company Background and Basis of Presentation within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on our basis of presentation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances; such estimates and judgments are periodically reviewed. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nThe estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are those we consider the most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, including those that require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, intangible assets, goodwill, long-lived assets and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (2) performance of services has occurred; (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We consider persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement to be the receipt of a signed contract. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including transaction history and the credit worthiness of a customer. If we determine that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. We recognize performance incentive rebates and certain other business incentives as a reduction in revenue. We record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue.\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate revenue to each deliverable if the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company. We determine the fair value of the selling price for a deliverable using a hierarchy of (1) Company specific objective and reliable evidence, then (2) third-party evidence, then (3) best estimate of selling price. We allocate any arrangement fee to each of the elements based on their relative selling prices. To the extent that we offer performance incentive rebates or certain other business incentives to our partners, those incentives will be recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nWe eliminate all intercompany revenue and transactions in consolidation.\nDomain Name Registration Fees\nWe recognize revenue from registration fees charged to third parties in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations on a straight-line basis over the registration term, which ranges from one to ten years. We record payments received in advance of the domain name registration term in deferred revenue in our balance sheets. The registration term and related revenue recognition commences once we confirm that the requested domain name has been recorded in the appropriate registry under accepted contractual performance standards. We defer the associated direct and incremental costs, which principally consist of registry and ICANN fees, and expense them as costs of revenue on a straight-line basis over the registration term. Deferred costs are recorded as assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur business includes Name.com, an ICANN accredited registrar. Thus, we are the primary obligor with our retail registrant customers and are responsible for the fulfillment of our registrar services to those parties. As a result, we report revenue in the amount of the fees we receive directly from our retail registrant customers.\nValue-added Services\nWe recognize revenue from online registrar value-added services, which include, but are not limited to, security certificates, domain name identification protection, charges associated with alternative payment methodologies, web hosting services and email services on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are provided. We include payments received in advance of services being provided in deferred revenue.\nDomain Name Monetization Services\nDomain name monetization service revenue represents advertising revenue and primarily includes revenue derived from cost-per-click advertising links we place on websites owned by us, which we acquire and sell on a regular basis, and on websites owned by certain of our customers, with whom we have revenue sharing arrangements. Where we enter into revenue sharing arrangements with our customers, such as those relating to advertising on our customers' domains, and when we are considered the primary obligor, we report the underlying revenue on a gross basis in our statements of operations, and record these revenue-sharing payments to our customers as revenue-sharing expenses, which are included in cost of revenue.\nDomain Name Sales\nDomain name sales revenue represents proceeds received from selling domain names from our portfolio, as well as proceeds received from selling domain names that are not renewed by customers of our registrar platform. Domain name sales are primarily conducted through our direct sales efforts as well as through third-party auction platforms. While certain domain names sold are registered on our registrar platform upon sale, we have determined that sales revenue and related registration revenue represent separate units of accounting. Because the domain name has value to the customers on a stand-alone basis, where a customer could resell it separately, without the registration service, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the registration service and no general rights of return. We evaluated each deliverable, domain name sale and domain name registration, to determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) or third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE\u201d) existed in order to determine the selling price for each unit of accounting.\nWe determined that there is VSOE for domain name registrations through analysis of historical stand-alone transactions sold by us, which have been consistently priced with limited discounts. For domain name sales, we have determined that TPE is not a practical alternative due to uniqueness of domain names compared to those sold by competitors and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. We have not established VSOE for domain names due to the lack of pricing consistency and other factors. Accordingly, we allocate revenue to the domain name sale deliverable in the arrangement based on best estimate of the selling price ( BESP\u201d). We determine BESP by reference to the total transaction price and an estimate of what a market participant would pay without the registration service. Based on the nature of the transaction and its elements, we believe that there are no meaningful discounts embedded in the overall arrangement. We recognize domain name sales revenue when title to the name is transferred to the buyer and the related registration fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the registration term. If we sell a domain name, we recognize any unamortized cost basis as a cost of revenue over the registration term.\nFor sales of domain names generated through third-party auction platforms, we recognize revenue net of auction service fee payments.\nIntangible Assets\nRegistration and Acquisition Costs of Monetized Domains\nWe capitalize the initial registration and acquisition costs of our monetized domain names, and amortize these costs over the expected useful life of the underlying domain name on a straight-line basis, which approximates the estimated pattern in which the underlying economic benefits are consumed. The expected useful lives of the monetized domain names range from 12 months to 72 months. We determine the appropriate useful life by performing an annual analysis of expected cash flows based on historical experience with domain names of similar quality and value.\nIn order to maintain the rights to each monetized domain name acquired, we pay periodic renewal registration fees, which cover a minimum period of twelve months. We record renewal registration fees of domain name intangible assets in deferred registration costs and recognize the costs over the renewal registration period, which is included in cost of revenue.\nAcquired in Business Combinations\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to our respective net tangible and intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include: trade names, non-compete agreements, owned website names, customer relationships, and technology. We determine the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to 20 years, using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.\ngTLDs\nWe capitalize payments for gTLD applications and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD registry operator rights and include them in other long-term assets. We have received and may continue to receive partial cash refunds for certain gTLD applications, and to the extent we elect to sell or withdraw certain gTLD applications throughout the process, we may also incur gains or losses on amounts invested. These gains have been recorded as gains on other assets, net, on the statements of operations. As gTLDs become available for their intended use, gTLD application fees and acquisition related costs are reclassified as finite lived intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 10 years, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed. Other costs incurred as part of the gTLD Initiative and not directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD registry operator rights are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, an impairment test would be performed by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. We have not recognized any such impairment loss associated with our finite-lived intangible assets during 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and the identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, as of October 1, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company's business outlook, legal factors, financial performance, industry environment, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. A triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter, and as such, an interim impairment test was performed (refer to Note 6-Goodwill within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information). Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to the reporting units, assignment of goodwill to the reporting units and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. Management has determined that we have only one reporting unit.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment using a two-step process. First, we determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than carrying value, then goodwill may be impaired and we perform the second step of the test to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step, we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount in order to determine if there is an impairment loss. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nWe estimate the fair value of the reporting unit in step one using the market approach. The market approach utilizes the Company's number of outstanding shares and the share price on the date of the annual test to determine a market capitalization value. We estimate the implied fair value of goodwill using the discounted cash flows approach. The implied fair value is primarily based on an estimate of the cash flows expected to result from the reporting unit but may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as our software, technology, patents and trademarks, and then discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. These estimates and the resulting valuations require significant judgment.\nThere were no impairment charges recorded related to goodwill during 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, an impairment test would be performed by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. We have not recognized any such impairment loss associated with our long-lived assets during 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or in our tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and we provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon technical merits, relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if we believe it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax benefit in the accompanying statements of operations.\nWe allocate the total tax expense (or benefit) between continuing operations and discontinued operations utilizing the intraperiod allocation rules of ASC 740. These rules provide for allocation of total tax expense (or benefit) among the various financial statement components.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Accounting Pronouncements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on our recently adopted accounting guidance and accounting guidance not yet adopted.\nDiscontinued Operations\nSubsequent to year-end, we completed the eNom Divestiture. eNom's wholesale and retail registrar provided infrastructure services that enabled a network of active resellers to offer domain name registration services and related value-added services to their customers. This revenue was previously included as part of the Registrar services revenue line item. Additionally, revenue and cost of revenue from NameJet related to eNom were included as part of the divestiture. This revenue was previously included as part of the Aftermarket and other services revenue line item.\nOnly those costs and expenses directly attributable to the eNom business were included in the results of discontinued operations. Additionally, transaction costs associated with the eNom Divestiture were included in the results of discontinued operations. Corporate overhead allocations were not included in discontinued operations.\nThe eNom Divestiture met the criteria of a discontinued operation\u201d as defined by ASC 205-20. eNom's assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale in the Company's balance sheet for all periods presented and eNom's results of operations are included in income from discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe following table sets forth our results of discontinued operations for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 155,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 156,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on other assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from discontinued operations before income tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Continuing Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands).

Registrar services revenue for 2016 increased by $4.2 million, or 17%, to $29.1 million compared to $24.9 million in 2015. The increase was driven by an increase of $1.1 million from registrations of new gTLD domain names and an increase of $1.3 million from legacy domain names. Additionally, the increase was due to $1.8 million of growth from value-added services and other monetization efforts.\n2015 compared to 2014. Registrar services revenue for 2015 increased by $5.5 million, or 28%, to $24.9 million compared to $19.4 million in 2014. The increase was driven by an increase of $2.4 million from registrations of new gTLD domain names and an increase of $1.9 million from legacy domain names. Additionally, the increase was due to $1.2 million of growth from value-added services and other monetization efforts.\nRegistry Services\n2016 compared to 2015. Registry services revenue for 2016 increased by $3.4 million, or 40%, to $11.8 million compared to $8.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by registrations of our owned and operated new gTLDs. As of December 31, 2016, our Registry services end of period domains increased 40% to 565,000 from 401,000 in 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014. Registry services revenue for 2015 increased by $6.5 million, to $8.4 million compared to $1.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by registrations of our owned and operated new gTLDs. Sales from the portfolio of new gTLDs we exclusively own and operate began in the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our Registry services end of period domains increased to 401,000 from 149,000 in 2014.\nAftermarket and Other\n2016 compared to 2015. Aftermarket and other revenue for 2016 decreased by $2.8 million, or 11%, to $22.6 million compared to $25.4 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our domain name monetization revenue of $3.9 million from a decrease in traffic on websites by lower margin third party advertising partners, partially offset by an increase in our domain sales of $1.1 million.\n2015 compared to 2014. Aftermarket and other revenue for 2015 increased by $3.4 million, or 15%, to $25.4 million compared to $22.0 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our domain name monetization revenue of $4.0 million from improved performance by third party advertising partners, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in our domain sales, driven by lower sales of domain names in our portfolio.\nCost and Expenses\nCosts and expenses were as follows (in thousands, except percentage data):\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation\nand amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on other assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (853\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,103\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (91\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,196\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,178\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,360\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (190\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenue\n2016 compared to 2015. Cost of revenue for 2016 increased by $0.6 million, or 2%, to $37.1 million compared to $36.5 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in domain name registration fees associated with our growth in registered domain names and related revenue, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in revenue sharing costs paid to our domain name monetization customers.\n2015 compared to 2014. Cost of revenue for 2015 increased by $6.6 million, or 22%, to $36.5 million compared to $29.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in revenue sharing costs paid to our domain name monetization customers and $2.7 million in domain name registration fees associated with our growth in registered domain names and related revenue, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million decline in personnel-related expenses.\nSales and Marketing\n2016 compared to 2015. Sales and marketing for 2016 decreased by $0.4 million, or 5%, to $8.1 million compared to $8.5 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease in advertising and marketing costs for marketing campaigns, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related costs of $0.2 million.\n2015 compared to 2014. Sales and marketing for 2015 increased by $2.3 million, or 37%, to $8.5 million compared to $6.2 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in advertising and marketing costs for new marketing campaigns for our owned gTLDs, as well as an increase of $0.9 million in personnel-related costs.\nTechnology and Development\n2016 compared to 2015. Technology and development for 2016 decreased by $2.1 million, or 16%, to $10.6 million compared to $12.7 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to $1.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs and a $0.6 million decrease in infrastructure and technology costs.\n2015 compared to 2014. Technology and development for 2015 increased by $0.5 million, or 4%, to $12.7 million compared to $12.2 million in 2014.

General and administrative for 2016 increased by $0.4 million, or 2%, to $19.6 million compared to $19.2 million in 2015. The increase was driven by a $0.2 million increase in personnel-related costs and a $0.2 million increase in facilities and infrastructure costs.\n2015 compared to 2014. General and administrative for 2015 decreased by $0.7 million, or 3%, to $19.2 million compared to $19.9 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.9 million decrease in infrastructure and technology costs, partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million of personnel-related costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2016 compared to 2015. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 decreased by $0.3 million, or 3%, to $12.7 million compared to $13.0 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.8 million in amortization expense due to the duration of useful life of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in depreciation expense on property and equipment.\n2015 compared to 2014. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 increased by $1.1 million, or 9%, to $13.0 million compared to $11.9 million in 2014.

Other (income) expense, net in 2014 included a $1.4 million gain on the sale of marketable securities.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n2016 compared to 2015. Income tax expense for 2016 was $7.3 million, compared to income tax benefit of $8.2 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to implementation of a valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets, a decrease in pre-tax book loss, and an increase in non-deductible warrant expense.\n2015 compared to 2014. Income tax benefit for 2015 was $8.2 million, compared to $8.4 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible warrant expense and stock based compensation shortfalls, and a decrease in research and development credits.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and certain gains, losses, and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of ongoing core business operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as loss from continuing operations adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and certain gains, losses, and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of ongoing core business operating results.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are helpful in understanding our financial performance and potential future results. These are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies and do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. In addition, we believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is useful to investors because they enhance the ability of investors to compare our results from period to period and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics we use in making operating decisions.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (33,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,324\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add (deduct):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,314\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,328\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on other assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,153\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,103\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition and realignment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction-related advisory and consulting fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,092\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $4.4 million, to $9.2 million, compared to $4.8 million in 2015.

Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash based investments in operations, including working capital, and corporate infrastructure to support our ability to generate revenue and conduct operations through cost of revenue, technology and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative activities. Cash used in investing activities has historically been, and is expected to be, significantly impacted by our ongoing investments in our platform, company infrastructure, equipment and our investments in gTLD applications. Our capital expenditures and investments in gTLDs have to date been funded by cash flows from operations, as well as proceeds from our credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $31.9 million along with our $30.0 million revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year-end, in connection with the eNom Divestiture, we received proceeds of approximately $76.7 million, which is subject to customary adjustments following the closing, including a working capital adjustment to the extent such amount is greater or less than the estimated net working capital amount determined at closing.\nIn connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement related to the eNom Divestiture, we are required to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $8.35 million until September 20, 2017, which amount will be reduced to $6.35 million thereafter until January 20, 2018, and further reduced to $5.35 million thereafter until April 20, 2018, subject to certain conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement.\nCredit Facilities\nSilicon Valley Bank Credit Facility\nIn August 2014, we entered into a $30.0 million revolving credit facility ( SVB Credit Facility\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d). Under this facility we may repay and reborrow until the maturity date in August 2017. The SVB Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $15.0 million.\nThe SVB Credit Facility provides us with the option to select the annual interest rate on borrowings in an amount equal to: (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of: (a) the prime rate; (b) 0.50% per annum above the federal funds effective rate; and (c) the Eurodollar base rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%, depending on our consolidated senior leverage ratio (as determined under the SVB Credit Facility), or (2) a Eurodollar base rate determined by reference to LIBOR for the interest period equivalent to such borrowing adjusted for certain reserve requirements, plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%, depending on our consolidated senior leverage ratio (as determined under the SVB Credit Facility). In addition, we pay a 2.00% fee for the balance of letters of credit issued under the SVB Credit Facility.\nWe pay fees on the portion of the facility that is not drawn. The unused fee is payable to SVB in arrears on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to 0.25% multiplied by the daily amount by which the aggregate commitments exceed the sum of the outstanding amount of loans and the outstanding amount of letter of credit obligations.\nThe SVB Credit Facility allows SVB to require mandatory prepayments of outstanding borrowings from amounts otherwise required to prepay the term loan under the Tennenbaum Credit Facility. In March 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 3\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank, which approves a one-time distribution of $10.0 million for the partial prepayment of our term loan under the Tennenbaum Credit Facility.\nThe SVB Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. This facility has financial covenants, including a requirement that we maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, minimum liquidity ratio, and minimum consolidated EBITDA. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under the SVB Credit Facility.\nWe incurred $0.6 million in fees to establish this facility that we have capitalized on our balance sheet as deferred financing costs, which we will amortize on a straight-line basis into interest expense over the term of the SVB Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had letters of credit with a face amount of $10.7 million that were issued under the SVB Credit Facility. On February 27, 2017, we reduced our outstanding letters of credit to $2.8 million.\nWe also drew $12.8 million under the SVB Credit Facility in November 2016. On January 20, 2017, we fully paid off and extinguished the outstanding principal balance of $12.8 million of our SVB Credit Facility and entered into a Limited Consent and Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 4\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank to release eNom as a party to the SVB Credit Facility in connection with the eNom Divestiture. In addition, the availability period for revolving loans under our credit facility is currently suspended until we satisfy certain conditions, including delivery of financial projections after giving effect to the eNom Divestiture. During this period of suspension, we are not required to comply with certain liquidity financial covenants under our credit facility until the availability period for our revolving loan is reinstated.\nTennenbaum Credit Facility\nIn August 2014, we entered into a $30.0 million term loan credit facility with certain funds managed by Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC ( Tennenbaum Credit Facility\u201d). Under this facility interest is based on a rate per year equal to LIBOR plus 8.75% and is payable quarterly. Quarterly principal payments of $375,000 on the term loan began March 31, 2015.\nIn November 2016, we fully paid off and extinguished the aggregate outstanding principal balance of $27.4 million of our Tennenbaum Credit Facility, and recognized a loss of $4.3 million representing the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt.\nIn connection with the Tennenbaum Credit Facility, we issued warrants to Tennebaum Capital Partners LLC to purchase up to an aggregate of 997,710 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $15.05 per share and will be exercisable in accordance with their terms at any time on or after February 6, 2015, through August 6, 2019. The warrants contain a cashless exercise\u201d feature that allows the warrant holders to exercise such warrants by surrendering a number of shares underlying the portion of the warrant being exercised with a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price payable to us.\nWe estimated the fair value of the warrants by using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method ( Black-Scholes\u201d). Under the Black-Scholes approach our key assumptions included the following: Stock price of $14.49, strike price of $15.05, volatility of 42.44%, risk-free rate of 1.67%, dividend yield of 0% and 5 year term. We used the resulting fair value to allocate the proceeds from the Tennenbaum Credit Facility between liability and equity components.\nSince the warrants are classified as equity, we allocated the proceeds from the debt and warrants using the relative fair value method. Under this method we allocated $4.4 million to the warrants which we recorded to equity, with the remaining portion assigned to the liability component. The excess of the principal amount of the credit facility over its carrying value of $25.6 million represents a note discount that we amortized to interest expense.\nWe incurred $3.2 million in fees to establish the Tennenbaum Credit Facility, which includes $2.3 million of deferred financing costs and $0.9 million of note discount. We capitalized these fees on our balance sheet and amortized the fees on an effective interest method into interest expense. In connection with the extinguishment in November 2016, we wrote-off the unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs of $4.0 million.\nWe believe our capital structure is appropriate for this stage of our operations and is sufficient to grow the business while pursuing our strategic objectives. However, we are participating in a dynamic and emerging environment, and will continuously evaluate our position relative to the opportunities available in the marketplace. We believe that our current cash balance and future cash from operations, together with our ability to access sources of financing, including debt and equity, will provide sufficient resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and new business development activities for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nHistorical Cash Flow Trends\nThe following table sets forth our major sources and (uses) of cash for each period as set forth below (in thousands):\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,611\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,776\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,798\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\nfrom continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,822\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,709\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,486\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities consists of cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities consist of domain registration costs paid to registries, personnel-related costs, discretionary marketing and advertising costs, and technology and development costs.\nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $4.6 million, $8.8 million and $16.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2016 was $41.1 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $0.9 million, a loss on the extinguishment of our Tennebaum Credit Facility of $4.3 million, and non-cash charges of $30.7 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $2.3 million.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2015 was $19.9 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $9.4 million, and non-cash charges of $17.5 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $3.0 million.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2014 was $7.4 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $22.1 million, gain on the sale of marketable securities of $1.4 million, and non-cash charges of $10.2 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $3.8 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur investing activities primarily consist of strategic acquisitions of gTLDs, purchases of intangible assets and purchases of property and equipment to support the overall growth in our business.\nNet cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $1.8 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $(1.8) million for 2015. The change in cash from investing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $12.8 million of payments and deposits for investments in gTLD applications, which was offset by a decrease in proceeds of $8.6 million from gTLD application withdrawals. Additionally, we had an increase of $1.5 million on the purchases of property and equipment and lower investments in intangible assets of $0.7 million. Cash invested in purchases of intangible assets and property and equipment, including internally developed software, was to support the growth of our business and infrastructure during these periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $(1.8) million in 2015 compared to $(9.3) million for 2014. The improvement was primarily due to a decrease of $22.3 million of payments and deposits for investments in gTLD applications, which was offset by a decrease in proceeds of $13.5 million from gTLD application withdrawals. Additionally, we had a decrease of $0.9 million on the purchases of property and equipment, lower investments in intangible assets of $0.6 million, and an increase of $3.0 million from the change in restricted cash and proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities in 2014.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur financing activities primarily consist of the repayment of principal on long-term debt and restricted stock unit activity.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $18.7 million in 2016 compared to $2.7 million in 2015. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment and extinguishment of the Tennenbaum Credit Facility of $27.7 million, the principal payments on the capital lease obligation of $1.0 million and the tax withholdings on restricted stock awards of $0.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $12.8 million draw on the SVB Credit Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $2.7 million in 2015 compared to $3.5 million in 2014. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of our credit facility and related debt financing costs in 2014 of $27.2 million, which was entered into to increase our liquidity and financial flexibility in pursuing our strategic objectives, including the acquisition of additional gTLDs. Additionally, the decrease was due to the principal payments on our credit facility of $1.5 million and the tax withholdings on restricted stock awards of $0.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $29.2 million parent company investment in 2014 and a $1.0 million payment for an acquisition holdback.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources other than those contractual obligations disclosed below.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Capital Lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating Lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Purchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes principal and interest on our credit facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Capital lease commitments are related to certain equipment under non-cancelable capital lease, as well as support for this equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Operating lease commitments are related to office facilities in various locations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> Purchase obligations consist of enforceable and legally binding arrangements with third parties related to services to support operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we have made certain indemnities under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. Those indemnities include intellectual property indemnities to our customers, indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware and indemnifications related to lease agreements. In addition, certain of our advertiser and distribution partner agreements contain certain indemnification provisions, which are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry. We have not incurred significant obligations under indemnification provisions historically, and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, we have no recorded liability for any of these indemnities. We have also agreed to customary indemnification provisions to Tucows in connection with the eNom Divestiture. We are required to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $8.35 million until September 20, 2017, which amount will be reduced to $6.35 million thereafter until January 20, 2018, and further reduced to $5.35 million thereafter until April 20, 2018, subject to certain conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of this report captioned Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should read the following discussion and analysis together with the audited financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. Throughout this discussion and analysis we refer to our years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, as 2016,\u201d 2015\u201d and 2014.\u201d\nOverview\nAs a leading provider of domain name services, we enable businesses and consumers to find, establish, and maintain their digital address-the starting point for connecting with their online audience. Millions of digital destinations, and businesses and consumers rely upon our comprehensive platform for the discovery, registration, usage and monetization of domain names. As a result, we are a leader in the multi-billion dollar domain name services industry, with a complete suite of services that our customers use as the foundation to build their entire online presence.\nOn January 20, 2017, we completed the divestiture (the eNom Divestiture\u201d) of eNom, Incorporated ( eNom\u201d), our wholly-owned registrar services business, to Tucows Inc. ( Tucows\u201d). eNom's registrar services business provides infrastructure services that enable a network of active resellers to offer domain name registration services to their customers. As part of the eNom Divestiture, Tucows also acquired eNom's interest in its joint venture with Web.com for NameJet, LLC ( NameJet\u201d), which offers domain name auction services to consumers. All references made to financial data, non-financial metrics and our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to the Company's continuing operations (after giving effect to the eNom Divestiture), unless specifically noted. eNom's revenue was $155.8 million for 2016. See Note 3-Business Divestiture within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe are a leading domain name registry with a portfolio of 40 gTLDs acquired from ICANN's New gTLD Program. To date, we have launched all 40 of our gTLDs into the market, including .LIVE, .NEWS, and .ROCKS. Our registry services business continues to build a diverse distribution network of over 135 ICANN accredited registrars, including Name.com, eNom and GoDaddy, as well as other complementary distribution partners such as website builders and email service providers that offer our gTLD domain names to businesses and consumers. Furthermore, our distribution network includes registrars and other partners in international markets, positioning our company to capture additional sales on a global scale. In addition to operating our own registry, we provide technical back-end infrastructure services to Donuts, a third-party operator of new gTLDs (collectively with the New gTLD Program, our gTLD Initiative\u201d).\nOur retail registrar, Name.com, directly offers domain name registration services to more than 248,000 consumers and businesses worldwide. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2.1 million domain names under management. Our domain name registration and related services, as well as our developed proprietary tools and services enable us to identify and acquire, as well as monetize and sell, domain names, both for our own portfolio of domain names as well as for our customers' domain names.\nThe combination of our registry and registrar services businesses makes us a leading provider of end-to-end domain name services. This uniquely positions us to capitalize on the New gTLD Program because we can distribute owned and third-party gTLDs through our retail registrar brand, Name.com, and our third-party registrar distribution channel.\nWe generate revenue through domain name registration subscriptions, including registrations of domain names for our owned gTLDs, and related value-added services. We also generate revenue from advertising on, and from the sale of, domain names that are registered to our customers or ourselves. Our business model is characterized by non-refundable, up-front payments, which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow. We had revenue of $62.1 million, net loss of $33.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million for 2016; compared to revenue of $57.4 million, net loss of $11.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million for 2015.\nSeparation from Demand Media\nPrior to August 1, 2014, Rightside was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Demand Media. On August 1, 2014, Demand Media completed a tax-free transaction involving the distribution of all outstanding shares of Rightside common stock to holders of Demand Media common stock as of the record date. Upon the Separation, holders of Demand Media common stock on the record date received one share of Rightside common stock for every five shares of Demand Media common stock. Rightside became an independent, publicly-traded company on the NASDAQ using the symbol: NAME.\u201d\nWe had agreements with Demand Media that impacted our results of operations and financial condition. This included a Transition Services Agreement (the TSA\u201d) and Tax Matters Agreement. Under the TSA, Demand Media provided us with certain financial, administrative, and accounting-related support and systems. The transition services were completed in February 2016.\nOur ability to raise equity capital is subject to the restrictions in the Tax Matters Agreement, which requires us to comply with the representations made in the IRS private letter ruling or in materials submitted to the IRS and our tax counsel in connection with the Separation. These representations contain restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the Separation to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including entering into any transaction or series of transactions as a results of which any person or group of persons would acquire or have the right to acquire from us or stockholders our stock greater than certain threshold amounts, or issuing our stock in an offering in amounts greater than certain threshold amounts. Some of these restrictions will apply for the two-year period after the Separation. If the Separation fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be responsible for taxes arising from the actions that cause the Separation to not qualify as tax-free.\nFull Year 2016 Highlights\nBelow are our key highlights as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. All comparisons are relative to the fiscal full year 2015.\n \u2022 Total revenue was $62.1 million compared to $57.4 million. \n \u2022 Registry services revenue increased 40% to $11.8 million from $8.4 million. \n \u2022 Registrar services revenue increased 17% to $29.1 million from $24.9 million. \n \u2022 Net loss was $33.7 million compared to $11.3 million. \n \u2022 Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $9.2 million compared to $4.8 million. \n \u2022 Cash and cash equivalents were $31.9 million. \n \u2022 Fully repaid and extinguished our term loan credit facility with Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC on November 7, 2016. \n \u2022 $12.8 million draw on the revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank on November 4, 2016. \nOpportunities, Challenges and Risks\nOur revenue is derived from domain name registrations and related value-added service subscriptions from our retail customers of our registrar platform, as well as from our Aftermarket and other services business. Over the past few years our revenue growth has been driven by strong growth in Name.com, our leading retail registrar, and significant growth from our Registry services business since launch in the first quarter of 2014. Going forward, we expect growth in our Registry services business as we narrow our focus on this faster growing, stronger margin and more profitable business.\nGrowth in revenue from our Registrar services business is dependent upon our ability to attract retail customers to our registrar platform, to sustain those recurring revenue relationships by maintaining consistent domain name registration and value-added service renewal rates and to grow those relationships through competitive pricing on domain name registrations, differentiated value-added services and customer service offerings. We also generate advertising revenue through our monetization platform for websites or domain names that we or our customers own. Going forward, we expect downward pressure on the revenue associated with these websites as we continue to see low traffic and advertising yields in the marketplace.\nWe received returns of deposits of $3.1 million, and made payments and deposits of $9.7 million and $32.0 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for gTLD applications under the New gTLD Program. These payments and deposits represent amounts paid directly to ICANN and third parties in the pursuit of certain exclusive gTLD operator rights. We capitalize payments made for gTLD applications and other acquisition related costs, and include them in other long-term assets and intangible assets on the balance sheets. As part of the New gTLD Program, we have received partial cash refunds for certain gTLD applications and to the extent we elect to sell or withdraw certain gTLD applications throughout the process, we will continue to incur gains or losses on amounts invested. Gains on the sale of our interest in gTLDs applications are recognized when realized, while losses are recognized when deemed probable. Upon the delegation of operator rights for each gTLD by ICANN, gTLD application fees and other acquisition-related costs are reclassified as finite-lived intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. We expense as incurred other costs incurred as part of this gTLD Initiative and not directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD operator rights.\nOur cost of revenue, which is the largest component of our operating expenses, can vary from period to period, particularly as a percentage of revenue. With the recent revenue growth coming from the sales of our higher margin Registry services business and the realization of pricing optimization initiatives launched in early 2016, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has decreased in 2016 compared to 2015.\nOur marketing expense has grown in recent years as we have promoted our Name.com retail registrar and the New gTLD Program. Marketing activity primarily flows through our sales and marketing expense line item. Although to the extent that our registry offers performance incentive rebates or other business incentives to our partners, those incentives are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nOver the long term, we expect our overall revenue to increase as the Registry services business becomes a larger contributor to our overall revenue mix. In addition, we are driving initiatives in the area of price optimization and other operating cost reduction programs that we believe will further expand our direct profit in the Registrar services business.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe review a number of business metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our Registry and Registrar services businesses, measure the performance of our business model, identify trends impacting our business, determine resource allocations, formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions.\nWe believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our performance:\n \u2022 Domain: We define a domain as an individual domain name registered by a third-party customer on Rightside's registry or registrar platform for which Rightside has begun to recognize revenue. \n \u2022 Average revenue per domain ( ARPD\u201d): We calculate Registry ARPD by dividing Registry services revenue for a period by the average number of domains registered on Rightside's registry platform in that period. We calculate Registrar ARPD by dividing Registrar services revenue for a period by the average number of domains registered on Rightside's registrar platform in that period. ARPD for partial year periods is annualized. \n \u2022 Renewal rate: We define the renewal rate as the percentage of domain names on our registry or registrar platform that are renewed after their original term expires. \nRegistry Services Metrics\nThe following table sets forth performance highlights of key business metrics for our Registry services for the periods presented (in thousands, except for per domain and percentage data):\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> End of period domains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 169.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per domain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Renewal rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegistrar Services Metrics\nThe following table sets forth performance highlights of key business metrics for our Registrar services for the periods presented (in millions, except for per domain and percentage data):\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> End of period domains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per domain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Renewal rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Revenue per Domain\nThe Registry average revenue per domain for 2016 decreased 20.5% to $24.40 from $30.69 in 2015. The Registry average revenue per domain for 2015 increased 19.1% to $30.69 from $25.76 in 2014. The increase in 2015 was driven primarily by premium sales and launch related fees.\nThe Registrar average revenue per domain for 2016 increased 9.5% to $15.84 from $14.46 in 2015. The Registrar average revenue per domain for 2015 increased 9.5% to $14.46 from $13.20 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to our profitability initiatives, as well as an increasing mix of higher margin new gTLDs, which have an average selling price approximately two to three times that of legacy gTLDs.\nRenewal Rate\nThe Registry renewal rate for 2016 was 56.3% compared to 58.6% in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to promotional units renewing at a lower rate.\nThe Registrar renewal rate for 2016 was 68.4% compared to 70.5% in 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by churn of customers with higher domains under management.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is principally comprised of registration fees charged to businesses and consumers in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations, including registrations of domain names for our own gTLDs. In addition, our registrar also generates revenue from the sale of other value-added services that are designed to help our customers easily build, enhance and protect their domain names, including security services, email accounts and web hosting, and the performance of services for registries. Finally, we generate advertising and domain name sales revenue as part of our aftermarket service offering. We generate this aftermarket revenue on domain names that we own, as well as by providing these services to third parties. Our revenue varies based upon the number of domain names registered or utilizing our aftermarket service offerings, the rates we charge our customers, our ability to sell value-added services, our ability to sell domain names from our portfolio, and the monetization we are able to achieve through our aftermarket service offerings. Performance incentive rebates and certain other business incentives are recognized as a reduction in revenue. We primarily market our retail registration services under our Name.com brand.\nOur revenue also includes registration fees from our portfolio of 40 gTLDs in general availability for which we are the exclusive registry operator, as part of the gTLD Initiative. The amount as well as the timing of revenue is uncertain and is dependent upon the demand and level of user adoption of new gTLDs, the timing and number of our back-end registry customers' launches of gTLDs, and the continued progress of the New gTLD Program. To the extent that our registry offers performance incentive rebates or certain other business incentives to our partners, those incentives are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs we incur with selling an incremental product to our customers. Substantially all cost of revenue relates to domain name registration costs, payment processing fees, third-party commissions and customer care. Similar to our billing practices, we pay domain costs at the time of purchase, but recognize the costs of service ratably over the life of the registration. Customer care expense represents the costs to consult, advise and service our customers' needs. Customer care expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) and are expensed as incurred. We expect cost of revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in future periods as we experience continued downward pressure on the revenue from our domain name monetization platform. Domain name costs include fees paid to the various domain registries and ICANN. We prepay these costs in advance for the life of the registration. The terms of registry pricing are established by an agreement between registries and registrars. Cost of revenue may increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue, depending on the mix of products sold in a particular period and the sales and marketing channels used.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing consists primarily of sales and marketing personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense), sales support, advertising, marketing and general promotional expenditures. We anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development consists primarily of costs associated with creation, development and distribution of our products and websites. These expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) associated with the design, development, deployment, testing, operation and enhancement of our products, as well as costs associated with the data centers and systems infrastructure supporting those products. Technology and development expenses may increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue depending on our level of investment in future headcount and global infrastructure footprint. We anticipate that our technology and development expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative consists primarily of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) from our executive, legal, finance, human resources and information technology organizations and facilities-related expenditures, as well as third-party professional fees, and insurance expenses. Professional fees are largely comprised of outside legal, audit and information technology consulting. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation expense consists of charges relating to the depreciation of the property and equipment used in our business. Depreciation expense may increase or decrease in absolute dollars in future periods depending on the future level of capital investments in hardware and other equipment. We expect the depreciation of property and equipment to remain relatively flat in the near term.\nAmortization expense consists of charges relating to the amortization of capitalized identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of domain names, including initial registration costs, as well as costs to acquire gTLDs, and intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the related expected useful lives of these assets. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on its historical experience of intangible assets of similar quality and value. We capitalize gTLD assets once they become available for their intended use and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the remaining contractual period of the registry operator agreement, which is approximately 10 years. We expect the amortization of intangible assets to remain relatively flat in the near term.\n(Gain) Loss on Other Assets, Net\n(Gain) loss on other assets, net consists of gains and losses on withdrawals or settlement of costs related to our interest in certain gTLD applications, as well as other sales of assets. We expect our gains and losses will vary depending upon potential gains or losses resulting from our resolution of gTLD applications for which there were multiple bidders.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense on our credit facilities. Interest expense includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount. We expect interest expense to significantly decrease in the near term, as we extinguished our debt and reduced our outstanding letters of credit. Please refer to Note 9-Debt and Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on the extinguishment of this debt.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net, consists primarily of realized gains related to the sale of marketable securities, transaction gains and losses on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and interest income.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes principally in the United States, and certain other countries where we have a legal presence, including Ireland, Canada and Cayman Islands. We anticipate that as we expand our operations outside the United States, we will become subject to taxation based on foreign statutory rates, and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates on income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nBasis of Presentation\nRefer to Note 1-Company Background and Basis of Presentation within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on our basis of presentation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances; such estimates and judgments are periodically reviewed. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nThe estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are those we consider the most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, including those that require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, intangible assets, goodwill, long-lived assets and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (2) performance of services has occurred; (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We consider persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement to be the receipt of a signed contract. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including transaction history and the credit worthiness of a customer. If we determine that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. We recognize performance incentive rebates and certain other business incentives as a reduction in revenue. We record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue.\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate revenue to each deliverable if the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company. We determine the fair value of the selling price for a deliverable using a hierarchy of (1) Company specific objective and reliable evidence, then (2) third-party evidence, then (3) best estimate of selling price. We allocate any arrangement fee to each of the elements based on their relative selling prices. To the extent that we offer performance incentive rebates or certain other business incentives to our partners, those incentives will be recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nWe eliminate all intercompany revenue and transactions in consolidation.\nDomain Name Registration Fees\nWe recognize revenue from registration fees charged to third parties in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations on a straight-line basis over the registration term, which ranges from one to ten years. We record payments received in advance of the domain name registration term in deferred revenue in our balance sheets. The registration term and related revenue recognition commences once we confirm that the requested domain name has been recorded in the appropriate registry under accepted contractual performance standards. We defer the associated direct and incremental costs, which principally consist of registry and ICANN fees, and expense them as costs of revenue on a straight-line basis over the registration term. Deferred costs are recorded as assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur business includes Name.com, an ICANN accredited registrar. Thus, we are the primary obligor with our retail registrant customers and are responsible for the fulfillment of our registrar services to those parties. As a result, we report revenue in the amount of the fees we receive directly from our retail registrant customers.\nValue-added Services\nWe recognize revenue from online registrar value-added services, which include, but are not limited to, security certificates, domain name identification protection, charges associated with alternative payment methodologies, web hosting services and email services on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are provided. We include payments received in advance of services being provided in deferred revenue.\nDomain Name Monetization Services\nDomain name monetization service revenue represents advertising revenue and primarily includes revenue derived from cost-per-click advertising links we place on websites owned by us, which we acquire and sell on a regular basis, and on websites owned by certain of our customers, with whom we have revenue sharing arrangements. Where we enter into revenue sharing arrangements with our customers, such as those relating to advertising on our customers' domains, and when we are considered the primary obligor, we report the underlying revenue on a gross basis in our statements of operations, and record these revenue-sharing payments to our customers as revenue-sharing expenses, which are included in cost of revenue.\nDomain Name Sales\nDomain name sales revenue represents proceeds received from selling domain names from our portfolio, as well as proceeds received from selling domain names that are not renewed by customers of our registrar platform. Domain name sales are primarily conducted through our direct sales efforts as well as through third-party auction platforms. While certain domain names sold are registered on our registrar platform upon sale, we have determined that sales revenue and related registration revenue represent separate units of accounting. Because the domain name has value to the customers on a stand-alone basis, where a customer could resell it separately, without the registration service, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the registration service and no general rights of return. We evaluated each deliverable, domain name sale and domain name registration, to determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) or third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE\u201d) existed in order to determine the selling price for each unit of accounting.\nWe determined that there is VSOE for domain name registrations through analysis of historical stand-alone transactions sold by us, which have been consistently priced with limited discounts. For domain name sales, we have determined that TPE is not a practical alternative due to uniqueness of domain names compared to those sold by competitors and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. We have not established VSOE for domain names due to the lack of pricing consistency and other factors. Accordingly, we allocate revenue to the domain name sale deliverable in the arrangement based on best estimate of the selling price ( BESP\u201d). We determine BESP by reference to the total transaction price and an estimate of what a market participant would pay without the registration service. Based on the nature of the transaction and its elements, we believe that there are no meaningful discounts embedded in the overall arrangement. We recognize domain name sales revenue when title to the name is transferred to the buyer and the related registration fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the registration term. If we sell a domain name, we recognize any unamortized cost basis as a cost of revenue over the registration term.\nFor sales of domain names generated through third-party auction platforms, we recognize revenue net of auction service fee payments.\nIntangible Assets\nRegistration and Acquisition Costs of Monetized Domains\nWe capitalize the initial registration and acquisition costs of our monetized domain names, and amortize these costs over the expected useful life of the underlying domain name on a straight-line basis, which approximates the estimated pattern in which the underlying economic benefits are consumed. The expected useful lives of the monetized domain names range from 12 months to 72 months. We determine the appropriate useful life by performing an annual analysis of expected cash flows based on historical experience with domain names of similar quality and value.\nIn order to maintain the rights to each monetized domain name acquired, we pay periodic renewal registration fees, which cover a minimum period of twelve months. We record renewal registration fees of domain name intangible assets in deferred registration costs and recognize the costs over the renewal registration period, which is included in cost of revenue.\nAcquired in Business Combinations\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to our respective net tangible and intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include: trade names, non-compete agreements, owned website names, customer relationships, and technology. We determine the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to 20 years, using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.\ngTLDs\nWe capitalize payments for gTLD applications and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD registry operator rights and include them in other long-term assets. We have received and may continue to receive partial cash refunds for certain gTLD applications, and to the extent we elect to sell or withdraw certain gTLD applications throughout the process, we may also incur gains or losses on amounts invested. These gains have been recorded as gains on other assets, net, on the statements of operations. As gTLDs become available for their intended use, gTLD application fees and acquisition related costs are reclassified as finite lived intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 10 years, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed. Other costs incurred as part of the gTLD Initiative and not directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD registry operator rights are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, an impairment test would be performed by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. We have not recognized any such impairment loss associated with our finite-lived intangible assets during 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and the identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, as of October 1, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company's business outlook, legal factors, financial performance, industry environment, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. A triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter, and as such, an interim impairment test was performed (refer to Note 6-Goodwill within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information). Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to the reporting units, assignment of goodwill to the reporting units and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. Management has determined that we have only one reporting unit.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment using a two-step process. First, we determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than carrying value, then goodwill may be impaired and we perform the second step of the test to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step, we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount in order to determine if there is an impairment loss. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nWe estimate the fair value of the reporting unit in step one using the market approach. The market approach utilizes the Company's number of outstanding shares and the share price on the date of the annual test to determine a market capitalization value. We estimate the implied fair value of goodwill using the discounted cash flows approach. The implied fair value is primarily based on an estimate of the cash flows expected to result from the reporting unit but may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as our software, technology, patents and trademarks, and then discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. These estimates and the resulting valuations require significant judgment.\nThere were no impairment charges recorded related to goodwill during 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, an impairment test would be performed by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. We have not recognized any such impairment loss associated with our long-lived assets during 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or in our tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and we provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon technical merits, relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if we believe it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax benefit in the accompanying statements of operations.\nWe allocate the total tax expense (or benefit) between continuing operations and discontinued operations utilizing the intraperiod allocation rules of ASC 740. These rules provide for allocation of total tax expense (or benefit) among the various financial statement components.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Accounting Pronouncements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on our recently adopted accounting guidance and accounting guidance not yet adopted.\nDiscontinued Operations\nSubsequent to year-end, we completed the eNom Divestiture. eNom's wholesale and retail registrar provided infrastructure services that enabled a network of active resellers to offer domain name registration services and related value-added services to their customers. This revenue was previously included as part of the Registrar services revenue line item. Additionally, revenue and cost of revenue from NameJet related to eNom were included as part of the divestiture.

Registrar services revenue for 2016 increased by $4.2 million, or 17%, to $29.1 million compared to $24.9 million in 2015. The increase was driven by an increase of $1.1 million from registrations of new gTLD domain names and an increase of $1.3 million from legacy domain names. Additionally, the increase was due to $1.8 million of growth from value-added services and other monetization efforts.\n2015 compared to 2014. Registrar services revenue for 2015 increased by $5.5 million, or 28%, to $24.9 million compared to $19.4 million in 2014. The increase was driven by an increase of $2.4 million from registrations of new gTLD domain names and an increase of $1.9 million from legacy domain names. Additionally, the increase was due to $1.2 million of growth from value-added services and other monetization efforts.\nRegistry Services\n2016 compared to 2015. Registry services revenue for 2016 increased by $3.4 million, or 40%, to $11.8 million compared to $8.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by registrations of our owned and operated new gTLDs. As of December 31, 2016, our Registry services end of period domains increased 40% to 565,000 from 401,000 in 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014. Registry services revenue for 2015 increased by $6.5 million, to $8.4 million compared to $1.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by registrations of our owned and operated new gTLDs. Sales from the portfolio of new gTLDs we exclusively own and operate began in the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our Registry services end of period domains increased to 401,000 from 149,000 in 2014.\nAftermarket and Other\n2016 compared to 2015. Aftermarket and other revenue for 2016 decreased by $2.8 million, or 11%, to $22.6 million compared to $25.4 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our domain name monetization revenue of $3.9 million from a decrease in traffic on websites by lower margin third party advertising partners, partially offset by an increase in our domain sales of $1.1 million.\n2015 compared to 2014. Aftermarket and other revenue for 2015 increased by $3.4 million, or 15%, to $25.4 million compared to $22.0 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our domain name monetization revenue of $4.0 million from improved performance by third party advertising partners, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in our domain sales, driven by lower sales of domain names in our portfolio.\nCost and Expenses\nCosts and expenses were as follows (in thousands, except percentage data):\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation\nand amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on other assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (853\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,103\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (91\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,196\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,178\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,360\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (190\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenue\n2016 compared to 2015. Cost of revenue for 2016 increased by $0.6 million, or 2%, to $37.1 million compared to $36.5 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in domain name registration fees associated with our growth in registered domain names and related revenue, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in revenue sharing costs paid to our domain name monetization customers.\n2015 compared to 2014. Cost of revenue for 2015 increased by $6.6 million, or 22%, to $36.5 million compared to $29.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in revenue sharing costs paid to our domain name monetization customers and $2.7 million in domain name registration fees associated with our growth in registered domain names and related revenue, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million decline in personnel-related expenses.\nSales and Marketing\n2016 compared to 2015. Sales and marketing for 2016 decreased by $0.4 million, or 5%, to $8.1 million compared to $8.5 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease in advertising and marketing costs for marketing campaigns, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related costs of $0.2 million.\n2015 compared to 2014. Sales and marketing for 2015 increased by $2.3 million, or 37%, to $8.5 million compared to $6.2 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in advertising and marketing costs for new marketing campaigns for our owned gTLDs, as well as an increase of $0.9 million in personnel-related costs.\nTechnology and Development\n2016 compared to 2015. Technology and development for 2016 decreased by $2.1 million, or 16%, to $10.6 million compared to $12.7 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to $1.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs and a $0.6 million decrease in infrastructure and technology costs.\n2015 compared to 2014. Technology and development for 2015 increased by $0.5 million, or 4%, to $12.7 million compared to $12.2 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in infrastructure and technology costs to support our registry platform and our operations as a standalone company, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in personnel-related costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\n2016 compared to 2015. General and administrative for 2016 increased by $0.4 million, or 2%, to $19.6 million compared to $19.2 million in 2015. The increase was driven by a $0.2 million increase in personnel-related costs and a $0.2 million increase in facilities and infrastructure costs.\n2015 compared to 2014. General and administrative for 2015 decreased by $0.7 million, or 3%, to $19.2 million compared to $19.9 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.9 million decrease in infrastructure and technology costs, partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million of personnel-related costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2016 compared to 2015. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 decreased by $0.3 million, or 3%, to $12.7 million compared to $13.0 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.8 million in amortization expense due to the duration of useful life of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in depreciation expense on property and equipment.\n2015 compared to 2014. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 increased by $1.1 million, or 9%, to $13.0 million compared to $11.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million in amortization expense due to an increase in intangible assets as we added new gTLDs to our portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in depreciation expense on property and equipment.\nGain on Other Assets, Net\n2016 compared to 2015. Gain on other assets, net for 2016 decreased by $8.5 million, or 91%, to $0.9 million compared to $9.4 million in 2015. The decrease was due to fewer withdrawals of our interest in certain gTLD applications.\n2015 compared to 2014. Gain on other assets, net for 2015 decreased by $12.7 million, or 57%, to $9.4 million compared to $22.1 million in 2014. The decrease was due to fewer withdrawals of our interest in certain gTLD applications.\nInterest Expense\n2016 compared to 2015. Interest expense for 2016 decreased by $0.6 million, or 13%, to $4.3 million compared to $4.9 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the early payoff of the Tennenbaum Credit Facility in November 2016.\n2015 compared to 2014. Interest expense for 2015 increased by $2.9 million, to $4.9 million compared to $2.0 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by interest expense on our credit facilities.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\n2016 compared to 2015. Other expense for 2016 was $12 thousand compared to other expense of $18 thousand in 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014. Other expense for 2015 was $18 thousand compared to other income of $1.2 million in 2014. Other (income) expense, net in 2014 included a $1.4 million gain on the sale of marketable securities.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n2016 compared to 2015. Income tax expense for 2016 was $7.3 million, compared to income tax benefit of $8.2 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to implementation of a valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets, a decrease in pre-tax book loss, and an increase in non-deductible warrant expense.\n2015 compared to 2014. Income tax benefit for 2015 was $8.2 million, compared to $8.4 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible warrant expense and stock based compensation shortfalls, and a decrease in research and development credits.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and certain gains, losses, and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of ongoing core business operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as loss from continuing operations adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and certain gains, losses, and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of ongoing core business operating results.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are helpful in understanding our financial performance and potential future results. These are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies and do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. In addition, we believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is useful to investors because they enhance the ability of investors to compare our results from period to period and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics we use in making operating decisions.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (33,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,324\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add (deduct):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,314\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,328\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on other assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,153\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,103\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition and realignment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction-related advisory and consulting fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,092\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $4.4 million, to $9.2 million, compared to $4.8 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $3.2 million and a decrease of $0.9 million for other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $0.3 million. The increase in cost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs we incur with selling an incremental product to our customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $7.9 million, to $4.8 million, compared to $(3.1) million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $20.8 million, a decrease of $0.9 million for personnel-related costs and a decrease of $0.6 million for other operating expenses, offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $12.8 million and an increase of $1.2 million in advertising and marketing costs.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Loss from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (in thousands):\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (41,051\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,871\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add (deduct):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,178\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,360\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on other assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (853\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,103\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition and realignment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,203\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,892\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,902\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, improved $6.7 million, to $(7.2) million, compared to $(13.9) million in 2015. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $4.7 million, a decrease of $1.0 million for personnel-related costs, a decrease of $0.8 million for network infrastructure costs and a decrease of $1.1 million for other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $0.9 million. The increase in cost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs we incur with selling an incremental product to our customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, improved $6.0 million, to $(13.9) million, compared to $(19.9) million in 2014. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $14.4 million and a decrease of $0.8 million for other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $6.5 million, an increase of $1.1 million in advertising and marketing costs, an increase of $1.0 million for personnel-related costs and an increase of $0.6 million for network infrastructure costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, we have principally financed our operations from net cash provided by our operating activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash based investments in operations, including working capital, and corporate infrastructure to support our ability to generate revenue and conduct operations through cost of revenue, technology and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative activities. Cash used in investing activities has historically been, and is expected to be, significantly impacted by our ongoing investments in our platform, company infrastructure, equipment and our investments in gTLD applications. Our capital expenditures and investments in gTLDs have to date been funded by cash flows from operations, as well as proceeds from our credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $31.9 million along with our $30.0 million revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year-end, in connection with the eNom Divestiture, we received proceeds of approximately $76.7 million, which is subject to customary adjustments following the closing, including a working capital adjustment to the extent such amount is greater or less than the estimated net working capital amount determined at closing.\nIn connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement related to the eNom Divestiture, we are required to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $8.35 million until September 20, 2017, which amount will be reduced to $6.35 million thereafter until January 20, 2018, and further reduced to $5.35 million thereafter until April 20, 2018, subject to certain conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement.\nCredit Facilities\nSilicon Valley Bank Credit Facility\nIn August 2014, we entered into a $30.0 million revolving credit facility ( SVB Credit Facility\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d). Under this facility we may repay and reborrow until the maturity date in August 2017. The SVB Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $15.0 million.\nThe SVB Credit Facility provides us with the option to select the annual interest rate on borrowings in an amount equal to: (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of: (a) the prime rate; (b) 0.50% per annum above the federal funds effective rate; and (c) the Eurodollar base rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%, depending on our consolidated senior leverage ratio (as determined under the SVB Credit Facility), or (2) a Eurodollar base rate determined by reference to LIBOR for the interest period equivalent to such borrowing adjusted for certain reserve requirements, plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%, depending on our consolidated senior leverage ratio (as determined under the SVB Credit Facility). In addition, we pay a 2.00% fee for the balance of letters of credit issued under the SVB Credit Facility.\nWe pay fees on the portion of the facility that is not drawn. The unused fee is payable to SVB in arrears on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to 0.25% multiplied by the daily amount by which the aggregate commitments exceed the sum of the outstanding amount of loans and the outstanding amount of letter of credit obligations.\nThe SVB Credit Facility allows SVB to require mandatory prepayments of outstanding borrowings from amounts otherwise required to prepay the term loan under the Tennenbaum Credit Facility. In March 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 3\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank, which approves a one-time distribution of $10.0 million for the partial prepayment of our term loan under the Tennenbaum Credit Facility.\nThe SVB Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. This facility has financial covenants, including a requirement that we maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, minimum liquidity ratio, and minimum consolidated EBITDA. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under the SVB Credit Facility.\nWe incurred $0.6 million in fees to establish this facility that we have capitalized on our balance sheet as deferred financing costs, which we will amortize on a straight-line basis into interest expense over the term of the SVB Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had letters of credit with a face amount of $10.7 million that were issued under the SVB Credit Facility. On February 27, 2017, we reduced our outstanding letters of credit to $2.8 million.\nWe also drew $12.8 million under the SVB Credit Facility in November 2016. On January 20, 2017, we fully paid off and extinguished the outstanding principal balance of $12.8 million of our SVB Credit Facility and entered into a Limited Consent and Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 4\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank to release eNom as a party to the SVB Credit Facility in connection with the eNom Divestiture. In addition, the availability period for revolving loans under our credit facility is currently suspended until we satisfy certain conditions, including delivery of financial projections after giving effect to the eNom Divestiture. During this period of suspension, we are not required to comply with certain liquidity financial covenants under our credit facility until the availability period for our revolving loan is reinstated.\nTennenbaum Credit Facility\nIn August 2014, we entered into a $30.0 million term loan credit facility with certain funds managed by Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC ( Tennenbaum Credit Facility\u201d). Under this facility interest is based on a rate per year equal to LIBOR plus 8.75% and is payable quarterly. Quarterly principal payments of $375,000 on the term loan began March 31, 2015.\nIn November 2016, we fully paid off and extinguished the aggregate outstanding principal balance of $27.4 million of our Tennenbaum Credit Facility, and recognized a loss of $4.3 million representing the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt.\nIn connection with the Tennenbaum Credit Facility, we issued warrants to Tennebaum Capital Partners LLC to purchase up to an aggregate of 997,710 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $15.05 per share and will be exercisable in accordance with their terms at any time on or after February 6, 2015, through August 6, 2019. The warrants contain a cashless exercise\u201d feature that allows the warrant holders to exercise such warrants by surrendering a number of shares underlying the portion of the warrant being exercised with a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price payable to us.\nWe estimated the fair value of the warrants by using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method ( Black-Scholes\u201d). Under the Black-Scholes approach our key assumptions included the following: Stock price of $14.49, strike price of $15.05, volatility of 42.44%, risk-free rate of 1.67%, dividend yield of 0% and 5 year term. We used the resulting fair value to allocate the proceeds from the Tennenbaum Credit Facility between liability and equity components.\nSince the warrants are classified as equity, we allocated the proceeds from the debt and warrants using the relative fair value method. Under this method we allocated $4.4 million to the warrants which we recorded to equity, with the remaining portion assigned to the liability component. The excess of the principal amount of the credit facility over its carrying value of $25.6 million represents a note discount that we amortized to interest expense.\nWe incurred $3.2 million in fees to establish the Tennenbaum Credit Facility, which includes $2.3 million of deferred financing costs and $0.9 million of note discount. We capitalized these fees on our balance sheet and amortized the fees on an effective interest method into interest expense. In connection with the extinguishment in November 2016, we wrote-off the unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs of $4.0 million.\nWe believe our capital structure is appropriate for this stage of our operations and is sufficient to grow the business while pursuing our strategic objectives. However, we are participating in a dynamic and emerging environment, and will continuously evaluate our position relative to the opportunities available in the marketplace. We believe that our current cash balance and future cash from operations, together with our ability to access sources of financing, including debt and equity, will provide sufficient resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and new business development activities for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nHistorical Cash Flow Trends\nThe following table sets forth our major sources and (uses) of cash for each period as set forth below (in thousands):\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,611\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,776\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,798\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\nfrom continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,822\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,709\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,486\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities consists of cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities consist of domain registration costs paid to registries, personnel-related costs, discretionary marketing and advertising costs, and technology and development costs.\nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $4.6 million, $8.8 million and $16.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2016 was $41.1 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $0.9 million, a loss on the extinguishment of our Tennebaum Credit Facility of $4.3 million, and non-cash charges of $30.7 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $2.3 million.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2015 was $19.9 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $9.4 million, and non-cash charges of $17.5 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $3.0 million.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2014 was $7.4 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $22.1 million, gain on the sale of marketable securities of $1.4 million, and non-cash charges of $10.2 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $3.8 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur investing activities primarily consist of strategic acquisitions of gTLDs, purchases of intangible assets and purchases of property and equipment to support the overall growth in our business.\nNet cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $1.8 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $(1.8) million for 2015. The change in cash from investing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $12.8 million of payments and deposits for investments in gTLD applications, which was offset by a decrease in proceeds of $8.6 million from gTLD application withdrawals. Additionally, we had an increase of $1.5 million on the purchases of property and equipment and lower investments in intangible assets of $0.7 million. Cash invested in purchases of intangible assets and property and equipment, including internally developed software, was to support the growth of our business and infrastructure during these periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $(1.8) million in 2015 compared to $(9.3) million for 2014. The improvement was primarily due to a decrease of $22.3 million of payments and deposits for investments in gTLD applications, which was offset by a decrease in proceeds of $13.5 million from gTLD application withdrawals. Additionally, we had a decrease of $0.9 million on the purchases of property and equipment, lower investments in intangible assets of $0.6 million, and an increase of $3.0 million from the change in restricted cash and proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities in 2014.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur financing activities primarily consist of the repayment of principal on long-term debt and restricted stock unit activity.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $18.7 million in 2016 compared to $2.7 million in 2015. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment and extinguishment of the Tennenbaum Credit Facility of $27.7 million, the principal payments on the capital lease obligation of $1.0 million and the tax withholdings on restricted stock awards of $0.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $12.8 million draw on the SVB Credit Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $2.7 million in 2015 compared to $3.5 million in 2014. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of our credit facility and related debt financing costs in 2014 of $27.2 million, which was entered into to increase our liquidity and financial flexibility in pursuing our strategic objectives, including the acquisition of additional gTLDs. Additionally, the decrease was due to the principal payments on our credit facility of $1.5 million and the tax withholdings on restricted stock awards of $0.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $29.2 million parent company investment in 2014 and a $1.0 million payment for an acquisition holdback.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources other than those contractual obligations disclosed below.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Capital Lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating Lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Purchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes principal and interest on our credit facilities. \n (2) Capital lease commitments are related to certain equipment under non-cancelable capital lease, as well as support for this equipment. \n (3) Operating lease commitments are related to office facilities in various locations. \n (4) Purchase obligations consist of enforceable and legally binding arrangements with third parties related to services to support operations. \nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we have made certain indemnities under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. Those indemnities include intellectual property indemnities to our customers, indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware and indemnifications related to lease agreements. In addition, certain of our advertiser and distribution partner agreements contain certain indemnification provisions, which are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry. We have not incurred significant obligations under indemnification provisions historically, and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, we have no recorded liability for any of these indemnities. We have also agreed to customary indemnification provisions to Tucows in connection with the eNom Divestiture. We are required to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $8.35 million until September 20, 2017, which amount will be reduced to $6.35 million thereafter until January 20, 2018, and further reduced to $5.35 million thereafter until April 20, 2018, subject to certain conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of this report captioned Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should read the following discussion and analysis together with the audited financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. Throughout this discussion and analysis we refer to our years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, as 2016,\u201d 2015\u201d and 2014.\u201d\nOverview\nAs a leading provider of domain name services, we enable businesses and consumers to find, establish, and maintain their digital address-the starting point for connecting with their online audience. Millions of digital destinations, and businesses and consumers rely upon our comprehensive platform for the discovery, registration, usage and monetization of domain names. As a result, we are a leader in the multi-billion dollar domain name services industry, with a complete suite of services that our customers use as the foundation to build their entire online presence.\nOn January 20, 2017, we completed the divestiture (the eNom Divestiture\u201d) of eNom, Incorporated ( eNom\u201d), our wholly-owned registrar services business, to Tucows Inc. ( Tucows\u201d). eNom's registrar services business provides infrastructure services that enable a network of active resellers to offer domain name registration services to their customers. As part of the eNom Divestiture, Tucows also acquired eNom's interest in its joint venture with Web.com for NameJet, LLC ( NameJet\u201d), which offers domain name auction services to consumers. All references made to financial data, non-financial metrics and our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to the Company's continuing operations (after giving effect to the eNom Divestiture), unless specifically noted. eNom's revenue was $155.8 million for 2016. See Note 3-Business Divestiture within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe are a leading domain name registry with a portfolio of 40 gTLDs acquired from ICANN's New gTLD Program. To date, we have launched all 40 of our gTLDs into the market, including .LIVE, .NEWS, and .ROCKS. Our registry services business continues to build a diverse distribution network of over 135 ICANN accredited registrars, including Name.com, eNom and GoDaddy, as well as other complementary distribution partners such as website builders and email service providers that offer our gTLD domain names to businesses and consumers. Furthermore, our distribution network includes registrars and other partners in international markets, positioning our company to capture additional sales on a global scale. In addition to operating our own registry, we provide technical back-end infrastructure services to Donuts, a third-party operator of new gTLDs (collectively with the New gTLD Program, our gTLD Initiative\u201d).\nOur retail registrar, Name.com, directly offers domain name registration services to more than 248,000 consumers and businesses worldwide. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2.1 million domain names under management. Our domain name registration and related services, as well as our developed proprietary tools and services enable us to identify and acquire, as well as monetize and sell, domain names, both for our own portfolio of domain names as well as for our customers' domain names.\nThe combination of our registry and registrar services businesses makes us a leading provider of end-to-end domain name services. This uniquely positions us to capitalize on the New gTLD Program because we can distribute owned and third-party gTLDs through our retail registrar brand, Name.com, and our third-party registrar distribution channel.\nWe generate revenue through domain name registration subscriptions, including registrations of domain names for our owned gTLDs, and related value-added services. We also generate revenue from advertising on, and from the sale of, domain names that are registered to our customers or ourselves. Our business model is characterized by non-refundable, up-front payments, which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow. We had revenue of $62.1 million, net loss of $33.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million for 2016; compared to revenue of $57.4 million, net loss of $11.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million for 2015.\nSeparation from Demand Media\nPrior to August 1, 2014, Rightside was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Demand Media. On August 1, 2014, Demand Media completed a tax-free transaction involving the distribution of all outstanding shares of Rightside common stock to holders of Demand Media common stock as of the record date. Upon the Separation, holders of Demand Media common stock on the record date received one share of Rightside common stock for every five shares of Demand Media common stock. Rightside became an independent, publicly-traded company on the NASDAQ using the symbol: NAME.\u201d\nWe had agreements with Demand Media that impacted our results of operations and financial condition. This included a Transition Services Agreement (the TSA\u201d) and Tax Matters Agreement. Under the TSA, Demand Media provided us with certain financial, administrative, and accounting-related support and systems. The transition services were completed in February 2016.\nOur ability to raise equity capital is subject to the restrictions in the Tax Matters Agreement, which requires us to comply with the representations made in the IRS private letter ruling or in materials submitted to the IRS and our tax counsel in connection with the Separation. These representations contain restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the Separation to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including entering into any transaction or series of transactions as a results of which any person or group of persons would acquire or have the right to acquire from us or stockholders our stock greater than certain threshold amounts, or issuing our stock in an offering in amounts greater than certain threshold amounts. Some of these restrictions will apply for the two-year period after the Separation. If the Separation fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be responsible for taxes arising from the actions that cause the Separation to not qualify as tax-free.\nFull Year 2016 Highlights\nBelow are our key highlights as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. All comparisons are relative to the fiscal full year 2015.\n \u2022 Total revenue was $62.1 million compared to $57.4 million. \n \u2022 Registry services revenue increased 40% to $11.8 million from $8.4 million. \n \u2022 Registrar services revenue increased 17% to $29.1 million from $24.9 million. \n \u2022 Net loss was $33.7 million compared to $11.3 million. \n \u2022 Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $9.2 million compared to $4.8 million. \n \u2022 Cash and cash equivalents were $31.9 million. \n \u2022 Fully repaid and extinguished our term loan credit facility with Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC on November 7, 2016. \n \u2022 $12.8 million draw on the revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank on November 4, 2016. \nOpportunities, Challenges and Risks\nOur revenue is derived from domain name registrations and related value-added service subscriptions from our retail customers of our registrar platform, as well as from our Aftermarket and other services business. Over the past few years our revenue growth has been driven by strong growth in Name.com, our leading retail registrar, and significant growth from our Registry services business since launch in the first quarter of 2014. Going forward, we expect growth in our Registry services business as we narrow our focus on this faster growing, stronger margin and more profitable business.\nGrowth in revenue from our Registrar services business is dependent upon our ability to attract retail customers to our registrar platform, to sustain those recurring revenue relationships by maintaining consistent domain name registration and value-added service renewal rates and to grow those relationships through competitive pricing on domain name registrations, differentiated value-added services and customer service offerings. We also generate advertising revenue through our monetization platform for websites or domain names that we or our customers own. Going forward, we expect downward pressure on the revenue associated with these websites as we continue to see low traffic and advertising yields in the marketplace.\nWe received returns of deposits of $3.1 million, and made payments and deposits of $9.7 million and $32.0 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for gTLD applications under the New gTLD Program. These payments and deposits represent amounts paid directly to ICANN and third parties in the pursuit of certain exclusive gTLD operator rights. We capitalize payments made for gTLD applications and other acquisition related costs, and include them in other long-term assets and intangible assets on the balance sheets. As part of the New gTLD Program, we have received partial cash refunds for certain gTLD applications and to the extent we elect to sell or withdraw certain gTLD applications throughout the process, we will continue to incur gains or losses on amounts invested. Gains on the sale of our interest in gTLDs applications are recognized when realized, while losses are recognized when deemed probable. Upon the delegation of operator rights for each gTLD by ICANN, gTLD application fees and other acquisition-related costs are reclassified as finite-lived intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. We expense as incurred other costs incurred as part of this gTLD Initiative and not directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD operator rights.\nOur cost of revenue, which is the largest component of our operating expenses, can vary from period to period, particularly as a percentage of revenue. With the recent revenue growth coming from the sales of our higher margin Registry services business and the realization of pricing optimization initiatives launched in early 2016, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has decreased in 2016 compared to 2015.\nOur marketing expense has grown in recent years as we have promoted our Name.com retail registrar and the New gTLD Program. Marketing activity primarily flows through our sales and marketing expense line item. Although to the extent that our registry offers performance incentive rebates or other business incentives to our partners, those incentives are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nOver the long term, we expect our overall revenue to increase as the Registry services business becomes a larger contributor to our overall revenue mix. In addition, we are driving initiatives in the area of price optimization and other operating cost reduction programs that we believe will further expand our direct profit in the Registrar services business.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe review a number of business metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our Registry and Registrar services businesses, measure the performance of our business model, identify trends impacting our business, determine resource allocations, formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions.\nWe believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our performance:\n \u2022 Domain: We define a domain as an individual domain name registered by a third-party customer on Rightside's registry or registrar platform for which Rightside has begun to recognize revenue. \n \u2022 Average revenue per domain ( ARPD\u201d): We calculate Registry ARPD by dividing Registry services revenue for a period by the average number of domains registered on Rightside's registry platform in that period. We calculate Registrar ARPD by dividing Registrar services revenue for a period by the average number of domains registered on Rightside's registrar platform in that period. ARPD for partial year periods is annualized. \n \u2022 Renewal rate: We define the renewal rate as the percentage of domain names on our registry or registrar platform that are renewed after their original term expires. \nRegistry Services Metrics\nThe following table sets forth performance highlights of key business metrics for our Registry services for the periods presented (in thousands, except for per domain and percentage data):\n\nRegistrar Services Metrics\nThe following table sets forth performance highlights of key business metrics for our Registrar services for the periods presented (in millions, except for per domain and percentage data):\n\nAverage Revenue per Domain\nThe Registry average revenue per domain for 2016 decreased 20.5% to $24.40 from $30.69 in 2015. The Registry average revenue per domain for 2015 increased 19.1% to $30.69 from $25.76 in 2014. The increase in 2015 was driven primarily by premium sales and launch related fees.\nThe Registrar average revenue per domain for 2016 increased 9.5% to $15.84 from $14.46 in 2015. The Registrar average revenue per domain for 2015 increased 9.5% to $14.46 from $13.20 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to our profitability initiatives, as well as an increasing mix of higher margin new gTLDs, which have an average selling price approximately two to three times that of legacy gTLDs.\nRenewal Rate\nThe Registry renewal rate for 2016 was 56.3% compared to 58.6% in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to promotional units renewing at a lower rate.\nThe Registrar renewal rate for 2016 was 68.4% compared to 70.5% in 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by churn of customers with higher domains under management.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is principally comprised of registration fees charged to businesses and consumers in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations, including registrations of domain names for our own gTLDs. In addition, our registrar also generates revenue from the sale of other value-added services that are designed to help our customers easily build, enhance and protect their domain names, including security services, email accounts and web hosting, and the performance of services for registries. Finally, we generate advertising and domain name sales revenue as part of our aftermarket service offering. We generate this aftermarket revenue on domain names that we own, as well as by providing these services to third parties. Our revenue varies based upon the number of domain names registered or utilizing our aftermarket service offerings, the rates we charge our customers, our ability to sell value-added services, our ability to sell domain names from our portfolio, and the monetization we are able to achieve through our aftermarket service offerings. Performance incentive rebates and certain other business incentives are recognized as a reduction in revenue. We primarily market our retail registration services under our Name.com brand.\nOur revenue also includes registration fees from our portfolio of 40 gTLDs in general availability for which we are the exclusive registry operator, as part of the gTLD Initiative. The amount as well as the timing of revenue is uncertain and is dependent upon the demand and level of user adoption of new gTLDs, the timing and number of our back-end registry customers' launches of gTLDs, and the continued progress of the New gTLD Program. To the extent that our registry offers performance incentive rebates or certain other business incentives to our partners, those incentives are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs we incur with selling an incremental product to our customers. Substantially all cost of revenue relates to domain name registration costs, payment processing fees, third-party commissions and customer care. Similar to our billing practices, we pay domain costs at the time of purchase, but recognize the costs of service ratably over the life of the registration. Customer care expense represents the costs to consult, advise and service our customers' needs. Customer care expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) and are expensed as incurred. We expect cost of revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in future periods as we experience continued downward pressure on the revenue from our domain name monetization platform. Domain name costs include fees paid to the various domain registries and ICANN. We prepay these costs in advance for the life of the registration. The terms of registry pricing are established by an agreement between registries and registrars. Cost of revenue may increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue, depending on the mix of products sold in a particular period and the sales and marketing channels used.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing consists primarily of sales and marketing personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense), sales support, advertising, marketing and general promotional expenditures. We anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development consists primarily of costs associated with creation, development and distribution of our products and websites. These expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) associated with the design, development, deployment, testing, operation and enhancement of our products, as well as costs associated with the data centers and systems infrastructure supporting those products. Technology and development expenses may increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue depending on our level of investment in future headcount and global infrastructure footprint. We anticipate that our technology and development expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative consists primarily of personnel-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) from our executive, legal, finance, human resources and information technology organizations and facilities-related expenditures, as well as third-party professional fees, and insurance expenses. Professional fees are largely comprised of outside legal, audit and information technology consulting. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decline in the near term as a percent of revenue as we realize the benefits of restructuring from the eNom Divestiture.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation expense consists of charges relating to the depreciation of the property and equipment used in our business. Depreciation expense may increase or decrease in absolute dollars in future periods depending on the future level of capital investments in hardware and other equipment. We expect the depreciation of property and equipment to remain relatively flat in the near term.\nAmortization expense consists of charges relating to the amortization of capitalized identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of domain names, including initial registration costs, as well as costs to acquire gTLDs, and intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the related expected useful lives of these assets. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on its historical experience of intangible assets of similar quality and value. We capitalize gTLD assets once they become available for their intended use and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the remaining contractual period of the registry operator agreement, which is approximately 10 years. We expect the amortization of intangible assets to remain relatively flat in the near term.\n(Gain) Loss on Other Assets, Net\n(Gain) loss on other assets, net consists of gains and losses on withdrawals or settlement of costs related to our interest in certain gTLD applications, as well as other sales of assets. We expect our gains and losses will vary depending upon potential gains or losses resulting from our resolution of gTLD applications for which there were multiple bidders.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense on our credit facilities. Interest expense includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount. We expect interest expense to significantly decrease in the near term, as we extinguished our debt and reduced our outstanding letters of credit. Please refer to Note 9-Debt and Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on the extinguishment of this debt.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net, consists primarily of realized gains related to the sale of marketable securities, transaction gains and losses on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and interest income.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes principally in the United States, and certain other countries where we have a legal presence, including Ireland, Canada and Cayman Islands. We anticipate that as we expand our operations outside the United States, we will become subject to taxation based on foreign statutory rates, and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates on income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nBasis of Presentation\nRefer to Note 1-Company Background and Basis of Presentation within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on our basis of presentation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances; such estimates and judgments are periodically reviewed. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nThe estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are those we consider the most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, including those that require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, intangible assets, goodwill, long-lived assets and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (2) performance of services has occurred; (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We consider persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement to be the receipt of a signed contract. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including transaction history and the credit worthiness of a customer. If we determine that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. We recognize performance incentive rebates and certain other business incentives as a reduction in revenue. We record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue.\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate revenue to each deliverable if the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company. We determine the fair value of the selling price for a deliverable using a hierarchy of (1) Company specific objective and reliable evidence, then (2) third-party evidence, then (3) best estimate of selling price. We allocate any arrangement fee to each of the elements based on their relative selling prices. To the extent that we offer performance incentive rebates or certain other business incentives to our partners, those incentives will be recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nWe eliminate all intercompany revenue and transactions in consolidation.\nDomain Name Registration Fees\nWe recognize revenue from registration fees charged to third parties in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations on a straight-line basis over the registration term, which ranges from one to ten years. We record payments received in advance of the domain name registration term in deferred revenue in our balance sheets. The registration term and related revenue recognition commences once we confirm that the requested domain name has been recorded in the appropriate registry under accepted contractual performance standards. We defer the associated direct and incremental costs, which principally consist of registry and ICANN fees, and expense them as costs of revenue on a straight-line basis over the registration term. Deferred costs are recorded as assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur business includes Name.com, an ICANN accredited registrar. Thus, we are the primary obligor with our retail registrant customers and are responsible for the fulfillment of our registrar services to those parties. As a result, we report revenue in the amount of the fees we receive directly from our retail registrant customers.\nValue-added Services\nWe recognize revenue from online registrar value-added services, which include, but are not limited to, security certificates, domain name identification protection, charges associated with alternative payment methodologies, web hosting services and email services on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are provided. We include payments received in advance of services being provided in deferred revenue.\nDomain Name Monetization Services\nDomain name monetization service revenue represents advertising revenue and primarily includes revenue derived from cost-per-click advertising links we place on websites owned by us, which we acquire and sell on a regular basis, and on websites owned by certain of our customers, with whom we have revenue sharing arrangements. Where we enter into revenue sharing arrangements with our customers, such as those relating to advertising on our customers' domains, and when we are considered the primary obligor, we report the underlying revenue on a gross basis in our statements of operations, and record these revenue-sharing payments to our customers as revenue-sharing expenses, which are included in cost of revenue.\nDomain Name Sales\nDomain name sales revenue represents proceeds received from selling domain names from our portfolio, as well as proceeds received from selling domain names that are not renewed by customers of our registrar platform. Domain name sales are primarily conducted through our direct sales efforts as well as through third-party auction platforms. While certain domain names sold are registered on our registrar platform upon sale, we have determined that sales revenue and related registration revenue represent separate units of accounting. Because the domain name has value to the customers on a stand-alone basis, where a customer could resell it separately, without the registration service, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the registration service and no general rights of return. We evaluated each deliverable, domain name sale and domain name registration, to determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) or third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE\u201d) existed in order to determine the selling price for each unit of accounting.\nWe determined that there is VSOE for domain name registrations through analysis of historical stand-alone transactions sold by us, which have been consistently priced with limited discounts. For domain name sales, we have determined that TPE is not a practical alternative due to uniqueness of domain names compared to those sold by competitors and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. We have not established VSOE for domain names due to the lack of pricing consistency and other factors. Accordingly, we allocate revenue to the domain name sale deliverable in the arrangement based on best estimate of the selling price ( BESP\u201d). We determine BESP by reference to the total transaction price and an estimate of what a market participant would pay without the registration service. Based on the nature of the transaction and its elements, we believe that there are no meaningful discounts embedded in the overall arrangement. We recognize domain name sales revenue when title to the name is transferred to the buyer and the related registration fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the registration term. If we sell a domain name, we recognize any unamortized cost basis as a cost of revenue over the registration term.\nFor sales of domain names generated through third-party auction platforms, we recognize revenue net of auction service fee payments.\nIntangible Assets\nRegistration and Acquisition Costs of Monetized Domains\nWe capitalize the initial registration and acquisition costs of our monetized domain names, and amortize these costs over the expected useful life of the underlying domain name on a straight-line basis, which approximates the estimated pattern in which the underlying economic benefits are consumed. The expected useful lives of the monetized domain names range from 12 months to 72 months. We determine the appropriate useful life by performing an annual analysis of expected cash flows based on historical experience with domain names of similar quality and value.\nIn order to maintain the rights to each monetized domain name acquired, we pay periodic renewal registration fees, which cover a minimum period of twelve months. We record renewal registration fees of domain name intangible assets in deferred registration costs and recognize the costs over the renewal registration period, which is included in cost of revenue.\nAcquired in Business Combinations\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to our respective net tangible and intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include: trade names, non-compete agreements, owned website names, customer relationships, and technology. We determine the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to 20 years, using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.\ngTLDs\nWe capitalize payments for gTLD applications and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD registry operator rights and include them in other long-term assets. We have received and may continue to receive partial cash refunds for certain gTLD applications, and to the extent we elect to sell or withdraw certain gTLD applications throughout the process, we may also incur gains or losses on amounts invested. These gains have been recorded as gains on other assets, net, on the statements of operations. As gTLDs become available for their intended use, gTLD application fees and acquisition related costs are reclassified as finite lived intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 10 years, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed. Other costs incurred as part of the gTLD Initiative and not directly attributable to the acquisition of gTLD registry operator rights are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, an impairment test would be performed by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. We have not recognized any such impairment loss associated with our finite-lived intangible assets during 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and the identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, as of October 1, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company's business outlook, legal factors, financial performance, industry environment, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. A triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter, and as such, an interim impairment test was performed (refer to Note 6-Goodwill within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information). Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to the reporting units, assignment of goodwill to the reporting units and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. Management has determined that we have only one reporting unit.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment using a two-step process. First, we determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than carrying value, then goodwill may be impaired and we perform the second step of the test to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step, we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount in order to determine if there is an impairment loss. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nWe estimate the fair value of the reporting unit in step one using the market approach. The market approach utilizes the Company's number of outstanding shares and the share price on the date of the annual test to determine a market capitalization value. We estimate the implied fair value of goodwill using the discounted cash flows approach. The implied fair value is primarily based on an estimate of the cash flows expected to result from the reporting unit but may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as our software, technology, patents and trademarks, and then discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. These estimates and the resulting valuations require significant judgment.\nThere were no impairment charges recorded related to goodwill during 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances occur, an impairment test would be performed by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. We have not recognized any such impairment loss associated with our long-lived assets during 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or in our tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and we provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon technical merits, relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if we believe it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax benefit in the accompanying statements of operations.\nWe allocate the total tax expense (or benefit) between continuing operations and discontinued operations utilizing the intraperiod allocation rules of ASC 740. These rules provide for allocation of total tax expense (or benefit) among the various financial statement components.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Accounting Pronouncements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on our recently adopted accounting guidance and accounting guidance not yet adopted.\nDiscontinued Operations\nSubsequent to year-end, we completed the eNom Divestiture. eNom's wholesale and retail registrar provided infrastructure services that enabled a network of active resellers to offer domain name registration services and related value-added services to their customers. This revenue was previously included as part of the Registrar services revenue line item. Additionally, revenue and cost of revenue from NameJet related to eNom were included as part of the divestiture. This revenue was previously included as part of the Aftermarket and other services revenue line item.\nOnly those costs and expenses directly attributable to the eNom business were included in the results of discontinued operations. Additionally, transaction costs associated with the eNom Divestiture were included in the results of discontinued operations. Corporate overhead allocations were not included in discontinued operations.\nThe eNom Divestiture met the criteria of a discontinued operation\u201d as defined by ASC 205-20. eNom's assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale in the Company's balance sheet for all periods presented and eNom's results of operations are included in income from discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe following table sets forth our results of discontinued operations for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nResults of Continuing Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands). The following information has been adjusted to remove the impact of the eNom Divestiture. As such, our results of operations for the periods presented are shown on a continuing operations basis. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\nThe following table presents our stock-based compensation expense included in the above line items (in thousands):\n\nThe following table presents our depreciation and amortization by expense classification (in thousands):\n\nThe following table presents our results of operations as a percentage of revenue (amounts may not total due to rounding):\n\nRevenue\nRevenue by service line was as follows (in thousands, except percentage data):\n\nAmounts in the Eliminations line reflect the elimination of intercompany transactions between our Registrar and Registry services businesses.\nRegistrar Services\n2016 compared to 2015. Registrar services revenue for 2016 increased by $4.2 million, or 17%, to $29.1 million compared to $24.9 million in 2015. The increase was driven by an increase of $1.1 million from registrations of new gTLD domain names and an increase of $1.3 million from legacy domain names. Additionally, the increase was due to $1.8 million of growth from value-added services and other monetization efforts.\n2015 compared to 2014. Registrar services revenue for 2015 increased by $5.5 million, or 28%, to $24.9 million compared to $19.4 million in 2014. The increase was driven by an increase of $2.4 million from registrations of new gTLD domain names and an increase of $1.9 million from legacy domain names. Additionally, the increase was due to $1.2 million of growth from value-added services and other monetization efforts.\nRegistry Services\n2016 compared to 2015. Registry services revenue for 2016 increased by $3.4 million, or 40%, to $11.8 million compared to $8.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by registrations of our owned and operated new gTLDs. As of December 31, 2016, our Registry services end of period domains increased 40% to 565,000 from 401,000 in 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014. Registry services revenue for 2015 increased by $6.5 million, to $8.4 million compared to $1.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by registrations of our owned and operated new gTLDs. Sales from the portfolio of new gTLDs we exclusively own and operate began in the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our Registry services end of period domains increased to 401,000 from 149,000 in 2014.\nAftermarket and Other\n2016 compared to 2015. Aftermarket and other revenue for 2016 decreased by $2.8 million, or 11%, to $22.6 million compared to $25.4 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our domain name monetization revenue of $3.9 million from a decrease in traffic on websites by lower margin third party advertising partners, partially offset by an increase in our domain sales of $1.1 million.\n2015 compared to 2014. Aftermarket and other revenue for 2015 increased by $3.4 million, or 15%, to $25.4 million compared to $22.0 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our domain name monetization revenue of $4.0 million from improved performance by third party advertising partners, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in our domain sales, driven by lower sales of domain names in our portfolio.\nCost and Expenses\nCosts and expenses were as follows (in thousands, except percentage data):\n\nCost of Revenue\n2016 compared to 2015. Cost of revenue for 2016 increased by $0.6 million, or 2%, to $37.1 million compared to $36.5 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in domain name registration fees associated with our growth in registered domain names and related revenue, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in revenue sharing costs paid to our domain name monetization customers.\n2015 compared to 2014. Cost of revenue for 2015 increased by $6.6 million, or 22%, to $36.5 million compared to $29.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in revenue sharing costs paid to our domain name monetization customers and $2.7 million in domain name registration fees associated with our growth in registered domain names and related revenue, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million decline in personnel-related expenses.\nSales and Marketing\n2016 compared to 2015. Sales and marketing for 2016 decreased by $0.4 million, or 5%, to $8.1 million compared to $8.5 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease in advertising and marketing costs for marketing campaigns, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related costs of $0.2 million.\n2015 compared to 2014. Sales and marketing for 2015 increased by $2.3 million, or 37%, to $8.5 million compared to $6.2 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in advertising and marketing costs for new marketing campaigns for our owned gTLDs, as well as an increase of $0.9 million in personnel-related costs.\nTechnology and Development\n2016 compared to 2015. Technology and development for 2016 decreased by $2.1 million, or 16%, to $10.6 million compared to $12.7 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to $1.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs and a $0.6 million decrease in infrastructure and technology costs.\n2015 compared to 2014. Technology and development for 2015 increased by $0.5 million, or 4%, to $12.7 million compared to $12.2 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in infrastructure and technology costs to support our registry platform and our operations as a standalone company, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in personnel-related costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\n2016 compared to 2015. General and administrative for 2016 increased by $0.4 million, or 2%, to $19.6 million compared to $19.2 million in 2015. The increase was driven by a $0.2 million increase in personnel-related costs and a $0.2 million increase in facilities and infrastructure costs.\n2015 compared to 2014. General and administrative for 2015 decreased by $0.7 million, or 3%, to $19.2 million compared to $19.9 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.9 million decrease in infrastructure and technology costs, partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million of personnel-related costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2016 compared to 2015. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 decreased by $0.3 million, or 3%, to $12.7 million compared to $13.0 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.8 million in amortization expense due to the duration of useful life of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in depreciation expense on property and equipment.\n2015 compared to 2014. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 increased by $1.1 million, or 9%, to $13.0 million compared to $11.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million in amortization expense due to an increase in intangible assets as we added new gTLDs to our portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in depreciation expense on property and equipment.\nGain on Other Assets, Net\n2016 compared to 2015. Gain on other assets, net for 2016 decreased by $8.5 million, or 91%, to $0.9 million compared to $9.4 million in 2015. The decrease was due to fewer withdrawals of our interest in certain gTLD applications.\n2015 compared to 2014. Gain on other assets, net for 2015 decreased by $12.7 million, or 57%, to $9.4 million compared to $22.1 million in 2014. The decrease was due to fewer withdrawals of our interest in certain gTLD applications.\nInterest Expense\n2016 compared to 2015. Interest expense for 2016 decreased by $0.6 million, or 13%, to $4.3 million compared to $4.9 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the early payoff of the Tennenbaum Credit Facility in November 2016.\n2015 compared to 2014. Interest expense for 2015 increased by $2.9 million, to $4.9 million compared to $2.0 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by interest expense on our credit facilities.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\n2016 compared to 2015. Other expense for 2016 was $12 thousand compared to other expense of $18 thousand in 2015.\n2015 compared to 2014. Other expense for 2015 was $18 thousand compared to other income of $1.2 million in 2014. Other (income) expense, net in 2014 included a $1.4 million gain on the sale of marketable securities.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n2016 compared to 2015. Income tax expense for 2016 was $7.3 million, compared to income tax benefit of $8.2 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to implementation of a valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets, a decrease in pre-tax book loss, and an increase in non-deductible warrant expense.\n2015 compared to 2014. Income tax benefit for 2015 was $8.2 million, compared to $8.4 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible warrant expense and stock based compensation shortfalls, and a decrease in research and development credits.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and certain gains, losses, and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of ongoing core business operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as loss from continuing operations adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and certain gains, losses, and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of ongoing core business operating results.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are helpful in understanding our financial performance and potential future results. These are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies and do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. In addition, we believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is useful to investors because they enhance the ability of investors to compare our results from period to period and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics we use in making operating decisions.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $4.4 million, to $9.2 million, compared to $4.8 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $3.2 million and a decrease of $0.9 million for other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $0.3 million. The increase in cost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs we incur with selling an incremental product to our customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $7.9 million, to $4.8 million, compared to $(3.1) million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $20.8 million, a decrease of $0.9 million for personnel-related costs and a decrease of $0.6 million for other operating expenses, offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $12.8 million and an increase of $1.2 million in advertising and marketing costs.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Loss from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (in thousands):\n\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, improved $6.7 million, to $(7.2) million, compared to $(13.9) million in 2015. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $4.7 million, a decrease of $1.0 million for personnel-related costs, a decrease of $0.8 million for network infrastructure costs and a decrease of $1.1 million for other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $0.9 million. The increase in cost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs we incur with selling an incremental product to our customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, improved $6.0 million, to $(13.9) million, compared to $(19.9) million in 2014. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $14.4 million and a decrease of $0.8 million for other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $6.5 million, an increase of $1.1 million in advertising and marketing costs, an increase of $1.0 million for personnel-related costs and an increase of $0.6 million for network infrastructure costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, we have principally financed our operations from net cash provided by our operating activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash based investments in operations, including working capital, and corporate infrastructure to support our ability to generate revenue and conduct operations through cost of revenue, technology and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative activities. Cash used in investing activities has historically been, and is expected to be, significantly impacted by our ongoing investments in our platform, company infrastructure, equipment and our investments in gTLD applications. Our capital expenditures and investments in gTLDs have to date been funded by cash flows from operations, as well as proceeds from our credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $31.9 million along with our $30.0 million revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year-end, in connection with the eNom Divestiture, we received proceeds of approximately $76.7 million, which is subject to customary adjustments following the closing, including a working capital adjustment to the extent such amount is greater or less than the estimated net working capital amount determined at closing.\nIn connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement related to the eNom Divestiture, we are required to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $8.35 million until September 20, 2017, which amount will be reduced to $6.35 million thereafter until January 20, 2018, and further reduced to $5.35 million thereafter until April 20, 2018, subject to certain conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement.\nCredit Facilities\nSilicon Valley Bank Credit Facility\nIn August 2014, we entered into a $30.0 million revolving credit facility ( SVB Credit Facility\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d). Under this facility we may repay and reborrow until the maturity date in August 2017. The SVB Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $15.0 million.\nThe SVB Credit Facility provides us with the option to select the annual interest rate on borrowings in an amount equal to: (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of: (a) the prime rate; (b) 0.50% per annum above the federal funds effective rate; and (c) the Eurodollar base rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%, depending on our consolidated senior leverage ratio (as determined under the SVB Credit Facility), or (2) a Eurodollar base rate determined by reference to LIBOR for the interest period equivalent to such borrowing adjusted for certain reserve requirements, plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%, depending on our consolidated senior leverage ratio (as determined under the SVB Credit Facility). In addition, we pay a 2.00% fee for the balance of letters of credit issued under the SVB Credit Facility.\nWe pay fees on the portion of the facility that is not drawn. The unused fee is payable to SVB in arrears on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to 0.25% multiplied by the daily amount by which the aggregate commitments exceed the sum of the outstanding amount of loans and the outstanding amount of letter of credit obligations.\nThe SVB Credit Facility allows SVB to require mandatory prepayments of outstanding borrowings from amounts otherwise required to prepay the term loan under the Tennenbaum Credit Facility. In March 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 3\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank, which approves a one-time distribution of $10.0 million for the partial prepayment of our term loan under the Tennenbaum Credit Facility.\nThe SVB Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. This facility has financial covenants, including a requirement that we maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, minimum liquidity ratio, and minimum consolidated EBITDA. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under the SVB Credit Facility.\nWe incurred $0.6 million in fees to establish this facility that we have capitalized on our balance sheet as deferred financing costs, which we will amortize on a straight-line basis into interest expense over the term of the SVB Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had letters of credit with a face amount of $10.7 million that were issued under the SVB Credit Facility. On February 27, 2017, we reduced our outstanding letters of credit to $2.8 million.\nWe also drew $12.8 million under the SVB Credit Facility in November 2016. On January 20, 2017, we fully paid off and extinguished the outstanding principal balance of $12.8 million of our SVB Credit Facility and entered into a Limited Consent and Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 4\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank to release eNom as a party to the SVB Credit Facility in connection with the eNom Divestiture. In addition, the availability period for revolving loans under our credit facility is currently suspended until we satisfy certain conditions, including delivery of financial projections after giving effect to the eNom Divestiture. During this period of suspension, we are not required to comply with certain liquidity financial covenants under our credit facility until the availability period for our revolving loan is reinstated.\nTennenbaum Credit Facility\nIn August 2014, we entered into a $30.0 million term loan credit facility with certain funds managed by Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC ( Tennenbaum Credit Facility\u201d). Under this facility interest is based on a rate per year equal to LIBOR plus 8.75% and is payable quarterly. Quarterly principal payments of $375,000 on the term loan began March 31, 2015.\nIn November 2016, we fully paid off and extinguished the aggregate outstanding principal balance of $27.4 million of our Tennenbaum Credit Facility, and recognized a loss of $4.3 million representing the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt.\nIn connection with the Tennenbaum Credit Facility, we issued warrants to Tennebaum Capital Partners LLC to purchase up to an aggregate of 997,710 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $15.05 per share and will be exercisable in accordance with their terms at any time on or after February 6, 2015, through August 6, 2019. The warrants contain a cashless exercise\u201d feature that allows the warrant holders to exercise such warrants by surrendering a number of shares underlying the portion of the warrant being exercised with a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price payable to us.\nWe estimated the fair value of the warrants by using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method ( Black-Scholes\u201d). Under the Black-Scholes approach our key assumptions included the following: Stock price of $14.49, strike price of $15.05, volatility of 42.44%, risk-free rate of 1.67%, dividend yield of 0% and 5 year term. We used the resulting fair value to allocate the proceeds from the Tennenbaum Credit Facility between liability and equity components.\nSince the warrants are classified as equity, we allocated the proceeds from the debt and warrants using the relative fair value method. Under this method we allocated $4.4 million to the warrants which we recorded to equity, with the remaining portion assigned to the liability component. The excess of the principal amount of the credit facility over its carrying value of $25.6 million represents a note discount that we amortized to interest expense.\nWe incurred $3.2 million in fees to establish the Tennenbaum Credit Facility, which includes $2.3 million of deferred financing costs and $0.9 million of note discount. We capitalized these fees on our balance sheet and amortized the fees on an effective interest method into interest expense. In connection with the extinguishment in November 2016, we wrote-off the unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs of $4.0 million.\nWe believe our capital structure is appropriate for this stage of our operations and is sufficient to grow the business while pursuing our strategic objectives. However, we are participating in a dynamic and emerging environment, and will continuously evaluate our position relative to the opportunities available in the marketplace. We believe that our current cash balance and future cash from operations, together with our ability to access sources of financing, including debt and equity, will provide sufficient resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and new business development activities for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nHistorical Cash Flow Trends\nThe following table sets forth our major sources and (uses) of cash for each period as set forth below (in thousands):\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities consists of cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities consist of domain registration costs paid to registries, personnel-related costs, discretionary marketing and advertising costs, and technology and development costs.\nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $4.6 million, $8.8 million and $16.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2016 was $41.1 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $0.9 million, a loss on the extinguishment of our Tennebaum Credit Facility of $4.3 million, and non-cash charges of $30.7 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $2.3 million.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2015 was $19.9 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $9.4 million, and non-cash charges of $17.5 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $3.0 million.\nOur loss from continuing operations in 2014 was $7.4 million, which included a gain on the withdrawal of gTLD applications of $22.1 million, gain on the sale of marketable securities of $1.4 million, and non-cash charges of $10.2 million such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred taxes. In addition, changes in our working capital generated $3.8 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur investing activities primarily consist of strategic acquisitions of gTLDs, purchases of intangible assets and purchases of property and equipment to support the overall growth in our business.\nNet cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $1.8 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $(1.8) million for 2015. The change in cash from investing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $12.8 million of payments and deposits for investments in gTLD applications, which was offset by a decrease in proceeds of $8.6 million from gTLD application withdrawals. Additionally, we had an increase of $1.5 million on the purchases of property and equipment and lower investments in intangible assets of $0.7 million. Cash invested in purchases of intangible assets and property and equipment, including internally developed software, was to support the growth of our business and infrastructure during these periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $(1.8) million in 2015 compared to $(9.3) million for 2014. The improvement was primarily due to a decrease of $22.3 million of payments and deposits for investments in gTLD applications, which was offset by a decrease in proceeds of $13.5 million from gTLD application withdrawals. Additionally, we had a decrease of $0.9 million on the purchases of property and equipment, lower investments in intangible assets of $0.6 million, and an increase of $3.0 million from the change in restricted cash and proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities in 2014.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities from Continuing Operations\nOur financing activities primarily consist of the repayment of principal on long-term debt and restricted stock unit activity.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $18.7 million in 2016 compared to $2.7 million in 2015. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment and extinguishment of the Tennenbaum Credit Facility of $27.7 million, the principal payments on the capital lease obligation of $1.0 million and the tax withholdings on restricted stock awards of $0.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $12.8 million draw on the SVB Credit Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $2.7 million in 2015 compared to $3.5 million in 2014. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of our credit facility and related debt financing costs in 2014 of $27.2 million, which was entered into to increase our liquidity and financial flexibility in pursuing our strategic objectives, including the acquisition of additional gTLDs. Additionally, the decrease was due to the principal payments on our credit facility of $1.5 million and the tax withholdings on restricted stock awards of $0.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $29.2 million parent company investment in 2014 and a $1.0 million payment for an acquisition holdback.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources other than those contractual obligations disclosed below.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes principal and interest on our credit facilities. \n (2) Capital lease commitments are related to certain equipment under non-cancelable capital lease, as well as support for this equipment. \n (3) Operating lease commitments are related to office facilities in various locations. \n (4) Purchase obligations consist of enforceable and legally binding arrangements with third parties related to services to support operations. \nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we have made certain indemnities under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. Those indemnities include intellectual property indemnities to our customers, indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware and indemnifications related to lease agreements. In addition, certain of our advertiser and distribution partner agreements contain certain indemnification provisions, which are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry. We have not incurred significant obligations under indemnification provisions historically, and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, we have no recorded liability for any of these indemnities. We have also agreed to customary indemnification provisions to Tucows in connection with the eNom Divestiture. We are required to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $8.35 million until September 20, 2017, which amount will be reduced to $6.35 million thereafter until January 20, 2018, and further reduced to $5.35 million thereafter until April 20, 2018, subject to certain conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table
