Selected Financial Data\" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information related to our segments, see Note 21 - Segment and Related Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 herein. For information regarding our revenues, net income and assets, see our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OVERVIEW\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorthWestern Corporation, doing business as NorthWestern Energy, provides electricity and natural gas to approximately 726,400 customers in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. As you read this discussion and analysis, refer to our Consolidated Statements of Income, which present the results of our operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Following is a discussion of our strategy and significant trends.\nWe are working to deliver safe, reliable and innovative energy solutions that create value for customers, communities, employees and investors. This includes bridging our history as a regulated utility safely providing low-cost and reliable service with our future as a globally-aware company offering a broader array of services performed by highly-adaptable and skilled employees. We seek to deliver value to our customers by providing high reliability and customer service, and an environmentally sustainable generation mix at an affordable price. We are focused on delivering long-term shareholder value by continuing to invest in our system including:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Infrastructure investment focused on a stronger and smarter grid to improve the customer experience, while enhancing grid reliability and safety.

This increase was primarily due to a gain related to the adjustment of our electric QF liability, the net impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, demand for electric transmission, favorable weather, and lower labor costs, partly offset by an increase in depreciation and depletion expense and an increase in expense associated with removing hazard trees outside of our electric transmission and distribution lines rights of way.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SIGNIFICANT TRENDS AND REGULATION\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMontana General Electric Rate Case\nIn September 2018, we filed an electric rate case with the MPSC requesting an annual increase to electric rates of approximately $34.9 million, which represents an approximate 6.6% increase in annual base revenues. Our request is based on a return on equity of 10.65% and an overall rate of return of 7.42% (except for Colstrip Unit 4 which the MPSC previously set for the life of the facility at a 10% return on equity and an 8.25% rate of return), based on approximately $2.35 billion of electric rate base and a capital structure of 51 percent debt and 49 percent equity.\nWe also requested that approximately $13.8 million of the rate increase be approved on an interim basis effective November 1, 2018. We expect to receive a decision on our interim request after intervenor testimony is filed. If the MPSC does not issue a final order within nine months of the filing, the new requested rates may be placed into effect on an interim and refundable basis.\nKey dates in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Intervenor testimony - February 12, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NorthWestern rebuttal testimony and cross-intervenor testimony - April 5, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Hearing commences - May 13, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to file a FERC rate case for our Montana transmission assets by the end of the first quarter of 2019. The revenue requirement associated with our Montana FERC assets is reflected in our MPSC jurisdictional rates as a credit to customers.\nElectric Resource Planning - Montana\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we expect to submit our draft 2019 Electricity Supply Resource Procurement Plan (Montana Resource Plan) with the MPSC. The Montana Resource Plan supports the goal of developing resources that will address the changing energy landscape in Montana to meet our customers' electric energy needs in a reliable and affordable manner. A\nsummary of the draft Montana Resource Plan was provided for public comment in January 2019. After submission to the MPSC, the draft will be available for public comment for 60 days.\nMontana is in the midst of a transition from producing more energy than is needed in the state with energy exported to the west, to a growing risk of not having enough capacity to serve Montana customers at critical times of peak load due to reductions in regional and in state energy generation as noted below:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our current peak requirement for energy is about 1,400 MW. We are currently 630 MW short, which is subject to market purchases. We forecast that our energy portfolio will be 725 MW short by 2025 with modest increased customer demand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Planned regional retirements of 3,500 MW of coal-fired generation are forecast by the Northwest Power and Conservation Council to cause regional peak energy shortages as early as 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe long-term objective of the Montana Resource Plan is a clean, cost-effective, stable and reliable energy portfolio. Based on our customers' future energy resource needs as identified in 2019, we expect to solicit competitive proposals for up to 200 MW of peaking capacity available by 2022, which is about one-fourth of our projected need in 2025. An independent evaluator will be used to assess the proposals. We expect the process will be repeated in subsequent years to provide a resource-adequate energy and capacity portfolio. Using this staged approach, we propose to add 200 MWs of capacity per year from 2022 to 2025.\nThe proposal solicitation process will consider a wide variety of resource options and sizing, ownership options and contract lengths. This includes power purchase agreements and owned energy resources comprised of different structures, terms and technologies that are cost-effective resources. The staged approach is designed to allow for incremental steps through time with opportunities for different resource type of new technologies while also building a reliable portfolio to meet local and regional conditions and minimizing customer impacts.\nWestern Energy Imbalance Market\nIn November 2018, we announced our intent to enter the Western EIM, operated by the California ISO, in the spring of 2021. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Participation in the Western EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. In order to participate in the Western EIM, we must demonstrate resource adequacy through a combination of owned or contracted resources.\nAssumptions regarding entry into the Western EIM are incorporated into our Montana Resource Plan. In early 2018, the California ISO began a process to enhance the day-ahead market within the full Independent System Operator's footprint (the EDAM initiative). The enhancements to the day-ahead market are targeted to go live in 2019 with a platform that will allow the addition of a day-ahead market to the Western EIM. The extension of EDAM to EIM participants has not yet been formally introduced as a stakeholder process, but if current EIM members and the California ISO support moving forward, a stakeholder process will be initiated regarding the day-ahead EIM that could go live as early as 2022. Our Montana Resource Plan assumes that EIM entry will occur in 2021, followed by EDAM entry in 2022 and the development of a full market with an independent system operator in 2025.\nElectric Resource Planning - South Dakota\nOur 2018 South Dakota Electricity Supply Resource Procurement Plan (South Dakota Resource Plan) identified approximately 90MWs of existing generation that should be retired and replaced over the next 10 years with the goal of improving reliability and lowering operating costs. We expect to issue a request for proposal in the second quarter of 2019 to replace 60 MW of combustion turbine generation by December 2021, comparing the relative costs of the addition of a reciprocating internal combustion engine facility to other market offerings. In addition, we are currently installing 8 MW of mobile capacity generation, with units expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nPURPA\nPURPA requires us to purchase power from qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities at a price approved by the MPSC that is meant to represent our avoided cost\u201d of generating power or purchasing power from another source. The cost to procure power from these QFs may not be a cost effective resource for customers, or the type of generation resource needed, resulting in increased supply costs that are inconsistent with resource plans developed based on a lowest cost and least risk basis while placing upward pressure on overall customer bills. Although the costs incurred to purchase power\nfrom QFs are passed on to customers, subject to the cost recovery mechanism discussed below, mandated purchases of QF generation, potentially at above-market prices, may reduce the need for new owned generation. This in turn could have a material adverse effect on our long-term capital investment plan and the affordability of future customer prices. We expect to establish a current avoided cost in Montana in conjunction with our Montana Resource Plan.\nColstrip\nColstrip Units 3 and 4 are supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under coal supply and transportation agreements with WeCo in effect through 2019. WeCo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2018. An auction was held for the core assets in January 2019, including the mine adjacent to Colstrip, with no qualified bids received. As a result a lenders group is expected to acquire the core assets. During the course of the bankruptcy, WeCo may choose to assume or reject the existing coal supply and transportation agreements. WeCo indicated that it intends to reject the existing cost plus coal supply agreement. If WeCo rejects the existing agreement, the fuel supply to Units 3 and 4 may be interrupted until new arrangements are in place. In addition, any new arrangements may have higher costs than the existing cost plus agreement.\nHazard Trees\nHazard trees are those trees that are structurally unsound and could fall into our lines if the trees failed. Hazard trees may be located inside or outside our electric transmission and distribution lines' rights of way and pose risks to our system including disruption of service, property damage, loss of life, and/or fires. We are facing challenges to address these trees. Beetle infestations have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber and have impacted our system for quite some time. As part of our normal vegetation management program, we have routinely removed trees from within our rights of way, including those infected by the beetle infestation. Additionally, in some circumstances, we were authorized to remove one or more hazard trees from outside of our rights of way that could harm our system.\nThe beetle infestation exacerbates the risk of fires in Montana, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire. Fires alleged to have been caused by our system could expose us to significant damage claims on theories such as strict liability, negligence, gross negligence, trespass, inverse condemnation, and others. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe worked with third parties, including the U.S. Forest Service, to develop a plan to remove these hazard trees. We identified areas severely impacted and determined that the only way to mitigate fire and reliability risk along these lines is to clear-cut all of the trees on either side of the electric lines that could hit the lines, if they fell. In most cases, this results in a corridor of approximately 100 feet on either side of the lines. Normal rights of way vary but are generally 20 feet to 40 feet wide on distribution lines and 40 feet to 100 feet wide on transmission lines. We finalized our plan to address the identified areas in the first quarter of 2018 and began work.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2018, we incurred approximately $3.3 million in costs related to this work, which is incremental to costs for vegetation management within our rights of way. We expect to continue the program over the next several years with anticipated 2019 costs ranging from approximately $7 million to $9 million, with total costs exceeding $20 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which enacts significant changes to U.S. tax and related laws. The primary impact to us is a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Dockets were opened in each of our jurisdictions to investigate the customer benefit of this reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. During 2018, we received approval of settlement agreements regarding the customer benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as described below.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In Montana the settlement provides a one-time credit of approximately $20.5 million to customers in early 2019. This includes a $19.2 million credit to electric customers and $1.3 million credit to natural gas customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>In addition to eligible customers receiving a one-time bill credit, the settlement also reduces rates for all natural gas customers by approximately $1.3 million annually beginning January 1, 2019, and provides funds for low-income energy assistance and weatherization programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>The settlement also reflects the agreement of the intervening parties not to oppose our request to include up to $3.5 million of costs to address hazard tree removal in our current Montana rate case.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>Issues related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes will be addressed in our current Montana rate case.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In South Dakota we credited electric and natural gas customers approximately $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, and agreed to a two-year rate moratorium until January 1, 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2018 results include a net benefit related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An income tax benefit of approximately $19.8 million due to the finalization of the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities upon completion of the associated regulatory dockets; offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A net loss of approximately $6.1 million including a reduction in revenue of approximately $23.5 million, due to customer credits in the above regulatory settlements, offset in part by a reduction in income tax expense, of approximately $17.4 million due to the reduction in federal tax rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we reflected the costs of our hazard tree program in the consolidated income statement as we agreed in our Montana settlement to request recovery of these costs in base customer rates in our 2018 filing, as discussed above, rather than using a portion of the reduction in customer rates associated with the change in tax rate as proposed in our Montana Tax Cuts and Jobs Act filing.\nWe expect a consolidated reduction in our cash flows from operations ranging from $20 million to $22 million in 2019, as a result of the customer credits discussed above while we are not a cash taxpayer. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. We currently estimate that our effective income tax rate will range from 0% to 5% in 2019.\nCost Recovery Mechanisms\nElectric Tracker - Effective July 1, 2017, the Montana legislature granted the MPSC discretion whether to approve an electric supply tracking mechanism. After considering our application in a contested case proceeding, the MPSC issued a final order in January 2019 approving a PCCAM with the following provisions:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A baseline of power supply costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Annual adjustment of customer prices to reflect a portion of the difference between the established base revenues and actual costs, to the extent such difference is outside a +/- $4.1 million \"deadband\" from the base, with 90% of the variance above or below the deadband collected from or refunded to customers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retroactive implementation to the effective date of the new legislation (July 1, 2017).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2018 results include a net reduction in the recovery of supply costs from customers of approximately $1.5 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which includes the following:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the 2017/2018 period, actual costs were below base revenues by approximately $3.4 million, resulting in no refund to customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the 2018/2019 period, actual costs were above base revenues by approximately $11.8 million, resulting in a regulatory asset for collection from customers of approximately $6.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and an approximately $4.9 million reduction in recovery of supply costs for the first six months of the period. For further discussion, see Results of Operations below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INVESTMENT\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur estimated capital expenditures for the next five years, including our electric and natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure investment plan, are as follows (in millions):\nDistribution and Transmission Modernization and Maintenance - As part of our commitment to maintain high level reliability and system performance we continue to evaluate the condition of our distribution and transmission assets to address aging infrastructure through our asset management process. The primary goals of our infrastructure investment are to reverse the trend in aging infrastructure, maintain reliability, proactively manage safety, build capacity into the system, and prepare our network for the adoption of new technologies. We are taking a proactive and pragmatic approach to replace these assets while also evaluating the implementation of additional technologies to prepare the overall system for smart grid applications. We are currently installing Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in our South Dakota and Nebraska jurisdictions. This project is expected to be completed in 2019 at a total cost of approximately $32 million. In Montana we are developing a similar AMI project to be started in 2020. While this project is still in the evaluation phase, we estimate our total AMI capital expenditures across all of our service territories to be in the range of approximately $100 to $110 million if fully deployed.\nElectric Supply Resource Plans - Our energy resource plans discussed above identify portfolio resource requirements including potential investments. While our resource plans identify needs, any owned generation is subject to successful completion of the competitive solicitation process and are not reflected in the projections above. We anticipate that owned assets to address energy and capacity needs for both Montana and South Dakota could increase the capital forecast presented above in excess of $200 million over the next five years.\nNatural Gas Production Assets - We own natural gas production and gathering system assets in Montana as a part of an overall strategy to provide rate stability and customer value through the addition of regulated assets that are not subject to market forces. Our estimated capital expenditure requirements above do not include estimates for incremental natural gas reserve acquisitions, potential peaking generation needs or other investment opportunities that may arise.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated results include the results of our divisions and subsidiaries constituting each of our business segments. The overall consolidated discussion is followed by a detailed discussion of gross margin by segment.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as another financial measure, Gross Margin, that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Gross Margin as Revenues less Cost of Sales as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nManagement believes that Gross Margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms. This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of results. Under our various state regulatory mechanisms, as detailed below, our supply costs are generally collected from customers, and as a result do not typically impact operating or net income. In addition, Gross Margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs, as well as to analyze how changes in loads (due to weather, economic or other conditions), rates and other factors impact our results of operations. Our Gross Margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies' presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nOur revenues may fluctuate substantially with changes in supply costs, which are generally collected in rates from customers. In addition, various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas utility service within their respective jurisdictions and regulate our ability to recover costs from customers.\nRevenues are also impacted by customer growth and usage, the latter of which is primarily affected by weather. Very cold winters increase demand for natural gas and to a lesser extent, electricity, while warmer than normal summers increase demand for electricity, especially among our residential and commercial customers. We measure this effect using degree-days, which is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of 65 degrees.

This increase was primarily due to plant additions and higher estimated property valuations in Montana. Under Montana law, we are allowed to track the changes in the actual level of state and local taxes and fees and recover 74% of the increase in taxes and fees, which is net of the associated income tax benefit.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $174.5 million in 2018, as compared with $166.1 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to plant additions.\nConsolidated operating income in 2018 was $266.3 million as compared with $271.7 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the overall increase in operating expenses, as discussed above, offset in part by higher gross margin.\nConsolidated interest expense in 2018 was $92.0 million, as compared with $92.3 million in 2017. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information regarding our financing activities.\nConsolidated other income in 2018, was $4.0 million, as compared with consolidated other expense of $3.4 million in 2017. This increase includes a $10.3 million decrease in other pension expense (which is offset in operating, general, and administrative expenses), partly offset by lower capitalization of AFUDC.\nConsolidated income tax benefit in 2018 was $18.7 million, as compared with consolidated income tax expense of $13.4 million in 2017. Our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was (10.5)% as compared with 7.6% for the same period of 2017. The decrease in income tax expense in 2018 is primarily due to the impact of the lower federal tax rate and a benefit of approximately $19.8 million associated with the final measurement of excess deferred taxes.\nThe following table summarizes the differences between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate (in millions):\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax calculated at federal statutory rate\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Permanent or flow through adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income, net of federal provisions\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n</td> <td>(19.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flow-through repairs deductions\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production tax credits\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year permanent return to accrual adjustments\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plant and depreciation of flow through items\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(56.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax (Benefit) Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net income in 2018 was $197.0 million as compared with $162.7 million in 2017.

This increase was primarily due to plant additions and higher estimated property valuations in Montana.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $166.1 million in 2017 as compared with $159.3 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to plant additions.\nConsolidated operating income in 2017 was $271.7 million, as compared with $255.0 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in gross margin as discussed above, offset in part by higher operating expenses.\nConsolidated interest expense in 2017 was $92.3 million, as compared with $95.0 million, in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the refinancing of debt in 2016. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information regarding our financing activities.\nConsolidated other income in 2017 was $3.4 million as compared with $3.5 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in other pension expense, offset in part by higher capitalization of AFUDC.\nConsolidated income tax expense in 2017 was $13.4 million as compared with an income tax benefit of $7.6 million in 2016. Our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 7.6% as compared with (4.9)% for the same period of 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $17.0 million due to the adoption of a tax accounting method change related to the costs to repair generation assets, which allowed us to take a current tax deduction for a significant amount of repair costs that were previously capitalized for tax purposes. Approximately $12.5 million of this deduction related to 2015 and prior tax years. This is reflected in the flow-through repairs deductions line due to the regulatory treatment.\nOur effective tax rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the regulatory impact of flowing through the federal and state tax benefit of repairs deductions, state tax benefit of accelerated tax depreciation deductions (including bonus depreciation when applicable) and production tax credits. The following table summarizes the differences between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate (in millions):\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax calculated at 35% Federal statutory rate\n</td> <td>61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Permanent or flow through adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income tax, net of federal provisions\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flow through repairs deductions\n</td> <td>(30.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production tax credits\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plant and depreciation of flow through items\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share based compensation\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year permanent return to accrual adjustments\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(48.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net income in 2017 was $162.7 million as compared with $164.2 million in 2016.

The increase in revenues for property taxes included in trackers is offset by increased property tax expense with no impact to net income.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe require liquidity to support and grow our business, and use our liquidity for working capital needs, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets, and to repay debt. We believe our cash flows from operations and existing borrowing capacity should be sufficient to fund our operations, service existing debt, pay dividends, and fund capital expenditures (excluding strategic growth opportunities). The amount of capital expenditures and dividends are subject to certain factors including the use of existing cash, cash equivalents and the receipt of cash from operations. In addition, a material change in operations or available financing could impact our current liquidity and ability to fund capital resource requirements, and we may defer a portion of our planned capital expenditures as necessary.\nLiquidity is provided by internal cash flows and the use of our unsecured revolving credit facility. We have a $400 million revolving credit facility. In addition, on March 27, 2018, we entered into a $25 million revolving credit facility, maturing March 27, 2020, to provide swingline borrowing capability. We utilize availability under our revolvers to manage our cash flows due to the seasonality of our business, and utilize any cash on hand in excess of current operating requirements to invest in our business and reduce borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, our total net liquidity was approximately $124.7 million, including $7.9 million of cash and $116.8 million of revolving credit facility availability. As of December 31, 2018, there was $0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding and $308 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. As of February 8, 2019, our availability under our revolving credit facility was approximately $132.8 million.\nWe issue debt securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce revolver debt, fund construction programs and for other general corporate purposes. To fund our strategic growth opportunities we utilize available cash flow, debt capacity and equity issuances that allows us to maintain investment grade ratings.\nIn September 2017, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith, Incorporated and J. P. Morgan Securities LLC, collectively the sales agents, pursuant to which we offered and sold shares of our common stock from time to time, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100 million. We concluded this program during the second quarter of 2018. During 2018, we issued 835,765 shares of our common stock at an average price of $54.45, for net proceeds of $44.9 million. Since inception of the program, we sold 1,724,703 shares of our common stock at an average price of $57.98 per share. Net proceeds received were approximately $98.5 million, which are net of sales commissions and other fees paid of approximately $1.4 million.\nWe plan to maintain a 50 - 55% debt to total capital ratio excluding capital leases, and expect to continue targeting a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60 - 70% of earnings per share; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these targets.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and eliminated bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. This reduction in federal income taxes results in lower regulated customer rates as discussed above in Significant Trends and Regulation. However, due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our future federal corporate income tax payments will also be reduced. Due to our existing Net Operating Loss (NOL) position and other tax credits, we expect to be a federal cash tax payer during 2020, with credits reducing our cash tax obligation into 2022. The reduction in revenues collected from customers is expected to negatively impact our 2019 cash flows from operations by approximately $20 million to $22 million.\nCredit Ratings\nIn general, less favorable credit ratings make debt financing more costly and more difficult to obtain on terms that are favorable to us and our customers, may impact our trade credit availability, and could result in the need to issue additional equity securities. Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and Standard and Poor's Ratings Service (S&P) are independent credit-rating agencies that rate our debt securities. These ratings indicate the agencies' assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our debt. As of February 8, 2019, our current ratings with these agencies are as follows:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Senior Secured Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Unsecured Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch (1)\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>F2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's (2)\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prime-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\n(1) In February 2018, Fitch affirmed our ratings, but revised our outlook from stable to negative citing continued regulatory headwinds in Montana and expected weakness in leverage metrics through 2021. Fitch also indicated that an adverse outcome in either our Montana electric supply tracker docket or our electric general rate case would likely result in a one-notch downgrade.\n(2) In May 2018, Moody's downgraded our senior secured rating to A3 from A2, and our unsecured credit rating to Baa2 from Baa1 and revised our outlook from negative to stable. Moody's cited an extended period of weak financial metrics and challenging regulatory relationship in Montana as reasons for the downgrade.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nCapital Requirements\nOur capital expenditures program is subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, changing business operating conditions and other business factors. We anticipate funding capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, available credit sources, debt and equity issuances and future rate increases. Our estimated capital expenditures are discussed above in the \"Investment\" section.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nWe have a variety of contractual obligations and other commitments that require payment of cash at certain specified periods. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018.

During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from natural gas and electric sales typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows and utilization of our existing revolver, are used to purchase natural gas to place in storage, perform maintenance and make capital improvements.\nThe effect of this seasonality on our liquidity is also impacted by changes in the market prices of our electric and natural gas supply, which is currently recovered through various monthly cost tracking mechanisms. These energy supply tracking mechanisms are designed to provide stable and timely recovery of supply costs on a monthly basis during the July to June annual tracking period, with an adjustment in the following annual tracking period to correct for any under or over collection in our monthly trackers. Due to the lag between our purchases of electric and natural gas commodities and revenue receipt from customers, cyclical over and under collection situations arise consistent with the seasonal fluctuations discussed above; therefore we usually under collect in the fall and winter and over collect in the spring. Fluctuations in recoveries under our cost tracking mechanisms can have a significant effect on cash flows from operations and make year-to-year comparisons difficult. In 2017, a Montana statute that provided for mandatory recovery of our prudently incurred electric supply costs was amended, and that statute now gives the MPSC discretion as to whether to approve electric supply costs. In the third quarter of 2018, the MPSC voted to approve a mechanism for recovery of electric supply costs that includes a sharing of costs beyond a\nspecified deadband above or below baseline costs, which may impact our cash flows. See Note 4 - Regulatory Matters, for further discussion of this docket.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are over collected on our natural gas and electric trackers by approximately $1.5 million, as compared with under collections of $13.2 million as of December 31, 2017, and $11.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash adjustments to net income\n</td> <td>169.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in working capital\n</td> <td>51.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other noncurrent assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>(36.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>382.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, plant and equipment additions\n</td> <td>(284.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(276.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(287.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>(18.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of assets\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in equity securities\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(304.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(276.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuances of long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit borrowings, net\n</td> <td>308.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Repayments) issuances of short-term borrowings, net\n</td> <td>(319.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends on common stock\n</td> <td>(109.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing costs\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(73.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $15.3 million as compared with $12.0 million at December 31, 2017. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $382.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $322.7 million during 2017. This increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to higher net income, improved customer receipts, and the receipt of insurance proceeds during the current period.\nOur 2017 operating cash flows increased by approximately $35.9 million as compared with 2016. This increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to customer refunds in 2016 associated with the DGGS FERC ruling and interim rates in our South Dakota electric rate case of approximately $30.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, and to higher net income after non-cash adjustments during 2017.\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $304.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $276.0 million during 2017, and $286.5 million in 2016. Plant additions during 2018 include maintenance additions of approximately $227.0 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $57.0 million, and the acquisition of the 9.7 MW Two Dot wind project in Montana for approximately $18.5 million. Plant additions during 2017 include maintenance additions of approximately $161.9 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $77.3 million, and infrastructure capital expenditures of approximately $37.2 million. Plant additions during 2016 include maintenance additions of approximately $158.6 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $79.0 million, and infrastructure capital expenditures of approximately $50.3 million.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities totaled $73.8 million during 2018 as compared to $44.2 million during 2017 and $9.4 million during 2016. During 2018, net cash used in financing activities reflects net repayments of commercial paper of $319.6 million and the payments of dividends of $109.2 million, partially offset by net issuances under our revolving lines of credit of $308.0 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $44.8 million. During 2017, net cash used in financing activities includes the payment of dividends of $101.3 million and the payment of financing costs of $16.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $53.7 million and net issuances of commercial paper of $18.7 million. During 2016, net cash used in financing activities includes the payment of dividends of $95.8 million and the payment of financing costs of $8.4 million, partially offset by net issuances of commercial paper of $70.9 million and net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $24.5 million.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be proper and reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the appropriateness of our estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider an estimate to be critical if it is material to the Consolidated Financial Statements and it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\nWe have identified the policies and related procedures below as critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these polices affect the reported amounts of revenue and are the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOur operations are subject to the provisions of ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980). Our regulatory assets are the probable future revenues associated with certain costs to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process, including our estimate of amounts recoverable for natural gas and electric supply purchases. Regulatory liabilities are the probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. This accounting treatment is impacted by the uncertainties of our regulatory environment, anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact. If any part of our operations becomes no longer subject to the provisions of ASC 980, or facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery, we would record a charge to earnings, which could be material. In addition, we would need to determine if there was any impairment to the carrying costs of the associated plant and inventory assets.\nWhile we believe that our assumptions regarding future regulatory actions are reasonable, different assumptions could materially affect our results. See Note 5 - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor and/or contribute to pension, postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Our reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits, as described in Note 15 - Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are dependent upon numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, rate of return on plan assets and other economic conditions, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. As a result of these factors, significant portions of pension and other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect (and are generally greater than) the actual benefits provided to plan participants. Due to the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of the obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, the determination of these costs is considered a critical accounting estimate.\nAssumptions\nKey actuarial assumptions utilized in determining these costs include:\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rates used in determining the future benefit obligations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mortality assumptions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary. The assumptions are based upon market interest rates, past experience and management's best estimate of future economic conditions.\nWe set the discount rate using a yield curve analysis, which projects benefit cash flows into the future and then discounts those cash flows to the measurement date using a yield curve. This is done by constructing a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities matches the year-by-year, projected benefit cash flow from our plans. Based on this\nanalysis as of December 31, 2018, our discount rate on the NorthWestern Corporation pension plan is 4.15% and on the NorthWestern Energy pension plan is 4.20%.\nIn determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we review historical returns, the future expectations for returns for each asset class weighted by the target asset allocation of the pension and postretirement portfolios, and long-term inflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption are 4.23% and 5.06% on the NorthWestern Corporation and NorthWestern Energy pension plan, respectively, for 2019.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of pension costs to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (in thousands):\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Pension Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Projected\nBenefit Obligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,435\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting Treatment\nWe recognize the funded status of each plan as an asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and are recognized into earnings only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, which reduces the volatility of reported pension costs. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nDue to the various regulatory treatments of the plans, our financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating us. Pension costs in Montana and other postretirement benefit costs in South Dakota are included in rates on a pay as you go basis for regulatory purposes. Pension costs in South Dakota and other postretirement benefit costs in Montana are included in rates on an accrual basis for regulatory purposes. Regulatory assets have been recognized for the obligations that will be included in future cost of service.\nIncome Taxes\nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes from temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Exposures exist related to various tax filing positions, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments by taxing authorities. We have reduced deferred tax assets or established liabilities based on our best estimate of future probable adjustments related to these exposures. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate exposures in light of any additional information and make adjustments as necessary to reflect the best estimate of the future outcomes. We currently estimate that as of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $258 million of consolidated NOLs prior to consideration of unrecognized tax benefits to offset federal taxable income in future years. We believe our deferred tax assets and established liabilities are appropriate for estimated exposures; however, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.\nThe interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. The uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes is accounted for by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. We recognize tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We have unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $56.2 million as of December 31, 2018. The resolution of tax matters in a\nparticular future period could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes, results of operations and our cash flows.\nQualifying Facilities Liability\nOur electric QF liability consists of unrecoverable costs associated with contracts covered under PURPA that are part of a 2002 stipulation with the MPSC and other parties. Under the terms of these contracts, we are required to purchase minimum amounts of energy at prices ranging from $63 to $136 per MWH through 2029. Our estimated gross contractual obligation is approximately $709.8 million through 2029. A portion of the costs incurred to purchase this energy is recoverable through rates, totaling approximately $567.2 million through 2029. We maintain an electric QF liability based on the net present value (discounted at 7.75%) of the difference between our estimated obligations under the QFs and the fixed amounts recoverable in rates.\nThe liability was established based on certain assumptions and projections over the contract terms related to pricing, estimated output and recoverable amounts. Since the liability is based on projections over the next several years, actual output, changes in pricing, contract amendments and regulatory decisions relating to these facilities could significantly impact the liability and our results of operations in any given year. In assessing the liability each reporting period, we compare our assumptions to actual results and make adjustments as necessary for that period.\nOne of the contracts contains variable pricing terms, which exposes us to price escalation risks. The estimated annual escalation rate for this contract is a key assumption and is based on a combination of historical actual results and market data available for future projections. In recording the electric QF liability, we estimated an annual escalation rate of 3% over the remaining term of the contract (through June 2024). The actual escalation rate changes annually, which could significantly impact the liability and our results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein for a discussion of new accounting standards.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

As you read this discussion and analysis, refer to our Consolidated Statements of Income, which present the results of our operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Following is a discussion of our strategy and significant trends.\nWe are working to deliver safe, reliable and innovative energy solutions that create value for customers, communities, employees and investors. This includes bridging our history as a regulated utility safely providing low-cost and reliable service with our future as a globally-aware company offering a broader array of services performed by highly-adaptable and skilled employees. We seek to deliver value to our customers by providing high reliability and customer service, and an environmentally sustainable generation mix at an affordable price. We are focused on delivering long-term shareholder value by continuing to invest in our system including:\n \u2022 Infrastructure investment focused on a stronger and smarter grid to improve the customer experience, while enhancing grid reliability and safety. This includes automation in distribution and substations that enables the use of changing technology. \n \u2022 Integrating supply resources that balance reliability, cost, capacity, and sustainability considerations with more predictable long-term commodity prices. \n \u2022 Continually improving our operating efficiency. Financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized return on invested capital and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings. \nWe expect to pursue these investment opportunities and manage our business in a manner that allows us to be flexible in adjusting to changing economic conditions by adjusting the timing and scale of the projects.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOW WE PERFORMED IN 2018 COMPARED TO OUR 2017 RESULTS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change, Net of Tax\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Items increasing (decreasing) net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QF liability adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impacts of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric transmission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Labor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and depletion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hazard trees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net income in 2018 was $197.0 million as compared with $162.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a gain related to the adjustment of our electric QF liability, the net impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, demand for electric transmission, favorable weather, and lower labor costs, partly offset by an increase in depreciation and depletion expense and an increase in expense associated with removing hazard trees outside of our electric transmission and distribution lines rights of way.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SIGNIFICANT TRENDS AND REGULATION\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMontana General Electric Rate Case\nIn September 2018, we filed an electric rate case with the MPSC requesting an annual increase to electric rates of approximately $34.9 million, which represents an approximate 6.6% increase in annual base revenues. Our request is based on a return on equity of 10.65% and an overall rate of return of 7.42% (except for Colstrip Unit 4 which the MPSC previously set for the life of the facility at a 10% return on equity and an 8.25% rate of return), based on approximately $2.35 billion of electric rate base and a capital structure of 51 percent debt and 49 percent equity.\nWe also requested that approximately $13.8 million of the rate increase be approved on an interim basis effective November 1, 2018. We expect to receive a decision on our interim request after intervenor testimony is filed. If the MPSC does not issue a final order within nine months of the filing, the new requested rates may be placed into effect on an interim and refundable basis.\nKey dates in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:\n \u2022 Intervenor testimony - February 12, 2019 \n \u2022 NorthWestern rebuttal testimony and cross-intervenor testimony - April 5, 2019 \n \u2022 Hearing commences - May 13, 2019 \nWe expect to file a FERC rate case for our Montana transmission assets by the end of the first quarter of 2019. The revenue requirement associated with our Montana FERC assets is reflected in our MPSC jurisdictional rates as a credit to customers.\nElectric Resource Planning - Montana\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we expect to submit our draft 2019 Electricity Supply Resource Procurement Plan (Montana Resource Plan) with the MPSC. The Montana Resource Plan supports the goal of developing resources that will address the changing energy landscape in Montana to meet our customers' electric energy needs in a reliable and affordable manner. A\nsummary of the draft Montana Resource Plan was provided for public comment in January 2019. After submission to the MPSC, the draft will be available for public comment for 60 days.\nMontana is in the midst of a transition from producing more energy than is needed in the state with energy exported to the west, to a growing risk of not having enough capacity to serve Montana customers at critical times of peak load due to reductions in regional and in state energy generation as noted below:\n \u2022 Our current peak requirement for energy is about 1,400 MW. We are currently 630 MW short, which is subject to market purchases. We forecast that our energy portfolio will be 725 MW short by 2025 with modest increased customer demand. \n \u2022 Planned regional retirements of 3,500 MW of coal-fired generation are forecast by the Northwest Power and Conservation Council to cause regional peak energy shortages as early as 2021. \nThe long-term objective of the Montana Resource Plan is a clean, cost-effective, stable and reliable energy portfolio. Based on our customers' future energy resource needs as identified in 2019, we expect to solicit competitive proposals for up to 200 MW of peaking capacity available by 2022, which is about one-fourth of our projected need in 2025. An independent evaluator will be used to assess the proposals. We expect the process will be repeated in subsequent years to provide a resource-adequate energy and capacity portfolio. Using this staged approach, we propose to add 200 MWs of capacity per year from 2022 to 2025.\nThe proposal solicitation process will consider a wide variety of resource options and sizing, ownership options and contract lengths. This includes power purchase agreements and owned energy resources comprised of different structures, terms and technologies that are cost-effective resources. The staged approach is designed to allow for incremental steps through time with opportunities for different resource type of new technologies while also building a reliable portfolio to meet local and regional conditions and minimizing customer impacts.\nWestern Energy Imbalance Market\nIn November 2018, we announced our intent to enter the Western EIM, operated by the California ISO, in the spring of 2021. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Participation in the Western EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. In order to participate in the Western EIM, we must demonstrate resource adequacy through a combination of owned or contracted resources.\nAssumptions regarding entry into the Western EIM are incorporated into our Montana Resource Plan. In early 2018, the California ISO began a process to enhance the day-ahead market within the full Independent System Operator's footprint (the EDAM initiative). The enhancements to the day-ahead market are targeted to go live in 2019 with a platform that will allow the addition of a day-ahead market to the Western EIM. The extension of EDAM to EIM participants has not yet been formally introduced as a stakeholder process, but if current EIM members and the California ISO support moving forward, a stakeholder process will be initiated regarding the day-ahead EIM that could go live as early as 2022. Our Montana Resource Plan assumes that EIM entry will occur in 2021, followed by EDAM entry in 2022 and the development of a full market with an independent system operator in 2025.\nElectric Resource Planning - South Dakota\nOur 2018 South Dakota Electricity Supply Resource Procurement Plan (South Dakota Resource Plan) identified approximately 90MWs of existing generation that should be retired and replaced over the next 10 years with the goal of improving reliability and lowering operating costs. We expect to issue a request for proposal in the second quarter of 2019 to replace 60 MW of combustion turbine generation by December 2021, comparing the relative costs of the addition of a reciprocating internal combustion engine facility to other market offerings. In addition, we are currently installing 8 MW of mobile capacity generation, with units expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nPURPA\nPURPA requires us to purchase power from qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities at a price approved by the MPSC that is meant to represent our avoided cost\u201d of generating power or purchasing power from another source. The cost to procure power from these QFs may not be a cost effective resource for customers, or the type of generation resource needed, resulting in increased supply costs that are inconsistent with resource plans developed based on a lowest cost and least risk basis while placing upward pressure on overall customer bills. Although the costs incurred to purchase power\nfrom QFs are passed on to customers, subject to the cost recovery mechanism discussed below, mandated purchases of QF generation, potentially at above-market prices, may reduce the need for new owned generation. This in turn could have a material adverse effect on our long-term capital investment plan and the affordability of future customer prices. We expect to establish a current avoided cost in Montana in conjunction with our Montana Resource Plan.\nColstrip\nColstrip Units 3 and 4 are supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under coal supply and transportation agreements with WeCo in effect through 2019. WeCo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2018. An auction was held for the core assets in January 2019, including the mine adjacent to Colstrip, with no qualified bids received. As a result a lenders group is expected to acquire the core assets. During the course of the bankruptcy, WeCo may choose to assume or reject the existing coal supply and transportation agreements. WeCo indicated that it intends to reject the existing cost plus coal supply agreement. If WeCo rejects the existing agreement, the fuel supply to Units 3 and 4 may be interrupted until new arrangements are in place. In addition, any new arrangements may have higher costs than the existing cost plus agreement.\nHazard Trees\nHazard trees are those trees that are structurally unsound and could fall into our lines if the trees failed. Hazard trees may be located inside or outside our electric transmission and distribution lines' rights of way and pose risks to our system including disruption of service, property damage, loss of life, and/or fires. We are facing challenges to address these trees. Beetle infestations have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber and have impacted our system for quite some time. As part of our normal vegetation management program, we have routinely removed trees from within our rights of way, including those infected by the beetle infestation. Additionally, in some circumstances, we were authorized to remove one or more hazard trees from outside of our rights of way that could harm our system.\nThe beetle infestation exacerbates the risk of fires in Montana, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire. Fires alleged to have been caused by our system could expose us to significant damage claims on theories such as strict liability, negligence, gross negligence, trespass, inverse condemnation, and others. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe worked with third parties, including the U.S. Forest Service, to develop a plan to remove these hazard trees. We identified areas severely impacted and determined that the only way to mitigate fire and reliability risk along these lines is to clear-cut all of the trees on either side of the electric lines that could hit the lines, if they fell. In most cases, this results in a corridor of approximately 100 feet on either side of the lines. Normal rights of way vary but are generally 20 feet to 40 feet wide on distribution lines and 40 feet to 100 feet wide on transmission lines. We finalized our plan to address the identified areas in the first quarter of 2018 and began work.\n \u2022 During 2018, we incurred approximately $3.3 million in costs related to this work, which is incremental to costs for vegetation management within our rights of way. We expect to continue the program over the next several years with anticipated 2019 costs ranging from approximately $7 million to $9 million, with total costs exceeding $20 million. \nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which enacts significant changes to U.S. tax and related laws. The primary impact to us is a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Dockets were opened in each of our jurisdictions to investigate the customer benefit of this reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. During 2018, we received approval of settlement agreements regarding the customer benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as described below.\n \u2022 In Montana the settlement provides a one-time credit of approximately $20.5 million to customers in early 2019. This includes a $19.2 million credit to electric customers and $1.3 million credit to natural gas customers. \n \u25e6 In addition to eligible customers receiving a one-time bill credit, the settlement also reduces rates for all natural gas customers by approximately $1.3 million annually beginning January 1, 2019, and provides funds for low-income energy assistance and weatherization programs. \n \u25e6 The settlement also reflects the agreement of the intervening parties not to oppose our request to include up to $3.5 million of costs to address hazard tree removal in our current Montana rate case. \n \u25e6 Issues related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes will be addressed in our current Montana rate case. \n \u2022 In South Dakota we credited electric and natural gas customers approximately $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, and agreed to a two-year rate moratorium until January 1, 2021. \nOur 2018 results include a net benefit related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes:\n \u2022 An income tax benefit of approximately $19.8 million due to the finalization of the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities upon completion of the associated regulatory dockets; offset by \n \u2022 A net loss of approximately $6.1 million including a reduction in revenue of approximately $23.5 million, due to customer credits in the above regulatory settlements, offset in part by a reduction in income tax expense, of approximately $17.4 million due to the reduction in federal tax rate. \nIn addition, we reflected the costs of our hazard tree program in the consolidated income statement as we agreed in our Montana settlement to request recovery of these costs in base customer rates in our 2018 filing, as discussed above, rather than using a portion of the reduction in customer rates associated with the change in tax rate as proposed in our Montana Tax Cuts and Jobs Act filing.\nWe expect a consolidated reduction in our cash flows from operations ranging from $20 million to $22 million in 2019, as a result of the customer credits discussed above while we are not a cash taxpayer. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. We currently estimate that our effective income tax rate will range from 0% to 5% in 2019.\nCost Recovery Mechanisms\nElectric Tracker - Effective July 1, 2017, the Montana legislature granted the MPSC discretion whether to approve an electric supply tracking mechanism. After considering our application in a contested case proceeding, the MPSC issued a final order in January 2019 approving a PCCAM with the following provisions:\n \u2022 A baseline of power supply costs; \n \u2022 Annual adjustment of customer prices to reflect a portion of the difference between the established base revenues and actual costs, to the extent such difference is outside a +/- $4.1 million \"deadband\" from the base, with 90% of the variance above or below the deadband collected from or refunded to customers; and \n \u2022 Retroactive implementation to the effective date of the new legislation (July 1, 2017). \nOur 2018 results include a net reduction in the recovery of supply costs from customers of approximately $1.5 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which includes the following:\n \u2022 For the 2017/2018 period, actual costs were below base revenues by approximately $3.4 million, resulting in no refund to customers. \n \u2022 For the 2018/2019 period, actual costs were above base revenues by approximately $11.8 million, resulting in a regulatory asset for collection from customers of approximately $6.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and an approximately $4.9 million reduction in recovery of supply costs for the first six months of the period. For further discussion, see Results of Operations below. \n INVESTMENT \nOur estimated capital expenditures for the next five years, including our electric and natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure investment plan, are as follows (in millions):\nDistribution and Transmission Modernization and Maintenance - As part of our commitment to maintain high level reliability and system performance we continue to evaluate the condition of our distribution and transmission assets to address aging infrastructure through our asset management process. The primary goals of our infrastructure investment are to reverse the trend in aging infrastructure, maintain reliability, proactively manage safety, build capacity into the system, and prepare our network for the adoption of new technologies. We are taking a proactive and pragmatic approach to replace these assets while also evaluating the implementation of additional technologies to prepare the overall system for smart grid applications. We are currently installing Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in our South Dakota and Nebraska jurisdictions. This project is expected to be completed in 2019 at a total cost of approximately $32 million. In Montana we are developing a similar AMI project to be started in 2020. While this project is still in the evaluation phase, we estimate our total AMI capital expenditures across all of our service territories to be in the range of approximately $100 to $110 million if fully deployed.\nElectric Supply Resource Plans - Our energy resource plans discussed above identify portfolio resource requirements including potential investments. While our resource plans identify needs, any owned generation is subject to successful completion of the competitive solicitation process and are not reflected in the projections above. We anticipate that owned assets to address energy and capacity needs for both Montana and South Dakota could increase the capital forecast presented above in excess of $200 million over the next five years.\nNatural Gas Production Assets - We own natural gas production and gathering system assets in Montana as a part of an overall strategy to provide rate stability and customer value through the addition of regulated assets that are not subject to market forces. Our estimated capital expenditure requirements above do not include estimates for incremental natural gas reserve acquisitions, potential peaking generation needs or other investment opportunities that may arise.\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nOur consolidated results include the results of our divisions and subsidiaries constituting each of our business segments. The overall consolidated discussion is followed by a detailed discussion of gross margin by segment.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as another financial measure, Gross Margin, that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Gross Margin as Revenues less Cost of Sales as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nManagement believes that Gross Margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms. This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of results. Under our various state regulatory mechanisms, as detailed below, our supply costs are generally collected from customers, and as a result do not typically impact operating or net income. In addition, Gross Margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs, as well as to analyze how changes in loads (due to weather, economic or other conditions), rates and other factors impact our results of operations. Our Gross Margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies' presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nOur revenues may fluctuate substantially with changes in supply costs, which are generally collected in rates from customers. In addition, various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas utility service within their respective jurisdictions and regulate our ability to recover costs from customers.\nRevenues are also impacted by customer growth and usage, the latter of which is primarily affected by weather. Very cold winters increase demand for natural gas and to a lesser extent, electricity, while warmer than normal summers increase demand for electricity, especially among our residential and commercial customers. We measure this effect using degree-days, which is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of 65 degrees. Heating degree-days result when the average daily temperature is less than the baseline. Cooling degree-days result when the average daily temperature is greater than the baseline. The statistical weather information in our regulated segments represents a comparison of this data.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OVERALL CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Natural Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of gross margin to operating revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>921.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,037.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>270.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,192.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,305.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Sales\n</td> <td>194.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>703.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>919.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>895.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure.

See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" above.\nConsolidated gross margin for items impacting net income increased $30.0 million, due to the following:\n \u2022 A reduction in the electric QF liability due to the combination of (i) a periodic adjustment of the liability for price escalation, which was less than modeled resulting in a liability reduction of approximately $17.5 million; and (ii) the annual reset to actual output and pricing resulting in approximately $7.6 million in lower QF related supply costs due to outages at two facilities; \n \u2022 Higher demand to transmit energy across our transmission lines due to market conditions and pricing; \n \u2022 An increase in electric and natural gas retail volumes due primarily to customer growth and favorable weather in South Dakota; and \n \u2022 An increase in our Montana gas rates effective September 1, 2017. \nThese increases were partly offset by a $6.1 million reduction in revenue due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act settlement and a $1.5 million reduction in recovery of Montana electric supply costs, as discussed above in Significant Trends and Regulation.\nThe change in consolidated gross margin also includes the following items that had no impact on net income:\n \u2022 A reduction in revenue in 2018 to reflect the pass-through of the Tax Cuts and Job Act related benefits to customers, which is offset by a decrease in income tax expense; \n \u2022 A decrease in natural gas gathering fees which are offset by reduced operating expenses; \n \u2022 A decrease in natural gas production taxes which are offset by reduced property and other taxes; \n \u2022 An increase in revenues for property taxes included in trackers, which are offset by increased property tax expense; and \n \u2022 An increase in revenue due to decreased production tax credit benefits passed through to customers in our tracker mechanisms, which is offset by increased income tax expense. \nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses (excluding cost of sales)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and other taxes\n</td> <td>171.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and depletion\n</td> <td>174.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>652.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated operating, general and administrative expenses were $307.1 million in 2018, as compared with $294.8 million in 2017.

This increase was primarily due to plant additions and higher estimated property valuations in Montana. Under Montana law, we are allowed to track the changes in the actual level of state and local taxes and fees and recover 74% of the increase in taxes and fees, which is net of the associated income tax benefit.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $174.5 million in 2018, as compared with $166.1 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to plant additions.\nConsolidated operating income in 2018 was $266.3 million as compared with $271.7 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the overall increase in operating expenses, as discussed above, offset in part by higher gross margin.\nConsolidated interest expense in 2018 was $92.0 million, as compared with $92.3 million in 2017. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information regarding our financing activities.\nConsolidated other income in 2018, was $4.0 million, as compared with consolidated other expense of $3.4 million in 2017. This increase includes a $10.3 million decrease in other pension expense (which is offset in operating, general, and administrative expenses), partly offset by lower capitalization of AFUDC.\nConsolidated income tax benefit in 2018 was $18.7 million, as compared with consolidated income tax expense of $13.4 million in 2017. Our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was (10.5)% as compared with 7.6% for the same period of 2017. The decrease in income tax expense in 2018 is primarily due to the impact of the lower federal tax rate and a benefit of approximately $19.8 million associated with the final measurement of excess deferred taxes.\nThe following table summarizes the differences between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate (in millions):\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax calculated at federal statutory rate\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Permanent or flow through adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income, net of federal provisions\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n</td> <td>(19.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flow-through repairs deductions\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production tax credits\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year permanent return to accrual adjustments\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plant and depreciation of flow through items\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(56.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax (Benefit) Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net income in 2018 was $197.0 million as compared with $162.7 million in 2017.

This increase was primarily due to plant additions and higher estimated property valuations in Montana.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $166.1 million in 2017 as compared with $159.3 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to plant additions.\nConsolidated operating income in 2017 was $271.7 million, as compared with $255.0 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in gross margin as discussed above, offset in part by higher operating expenses.\nConsolidated interest expense in 2017 was $92.3 million, as compared with $95.0 million, in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the refinancing of debt in 2016. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information regarding our financing activities.\nConsolidated other income in 2017 was $3.4 million as compared with $3.5 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in other pension expense, offset in part by higher capitalization of AFUDC.\nConsolidated income tax expense in 2017 was $13.4 million as compared with an income tax benefit of $7.6 million in 2016. Our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 7.6% as compared with (4.9)% for the same period of 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $17.0 million due to the adoption of a tax accounting method change related to the costs to repair generation assets, which allowed us to take a current tax deduction for a significant amount of repair costs that were previously capitalized for tax purposes. Approximately $12.5 million of this deduction related to 2015 and prior tax years. This is reflected in the flow-through repairs deductions line due to the regulatory treatment.\nOur effective tax rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the regulatory impact of flowing through the federal and state tax benefit of repairs deductions, state tax benefit of accelerated tax depreciation deductions (including bonus depreciation when applicable) and production tax credits. The following table summarizes the differences between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate (in millions):\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax calculated at 35% Federal statutory rate\n</td> <td>61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Permanent or flow through adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income tax, net of federal provisions\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flow through repairs deductions\n</td> <td>(30.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production tax credits\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plant and depreciation of flow through items\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share based compensation\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year permanent return to accrual adjustments\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(48.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net income in 2017 was $162.7 million as compared with $164.2 million in 2016.

Our wholesale and other revenues are largely gross margin neutral as they are offset by changes in cost of sales.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Results\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>874.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory amortization\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total retail revenues\n</td> <td>878.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>861.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission\n</td> <td>59.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale and other\n</td> <td>99.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>1,037.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,011.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cost of Sales\n</td> <td>334.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>703.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>678.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure.

measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" above.\nGross margin for items impacting net income increased $13.0 million including the following:\n \u2022 An increase in retail volumes from colder winter and spring weather and customer growth, partly offset by warmer summer weather; and \n \u2022 An increase in our Montana gas rates effective September 1, 2017. \nThese increases were partly offset by the recognition in 2016 of $0.8 million of deferred revenue as a result of an MPSC final order in our tracker filings. The increase in revenues for property taxes included in trackers is offset by increased property tax expense with no impact to net income.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe require liquidity to support and grow our business, and use our liquidity for working capital needs, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets, and to repay debt. We believe our cash flows from operations and existing borrowing capacity should be sufficient to fund our operations, service existing debt, pay dividends, and fund capital expenditures (excluding strategic growth opportunities). The amount of capital expenditures and dividends are subject to certain factors including the use of existing cash, cash equivalents and the receipt of cash from operations. In addition, a material change in operations or available financing could impact our current liquidity and ability to fund capital resource requirements, and we may defer a portion of our planned capital expenditures as necessary.\nLiquidity is provided by internal cash flows and the use of our unsecured revolving credit facility. We have a $400 million revolving credit facility. In addition, on March 27, 2018, we entered into a $25 million revolving credit facility, maturing March 27, 2020, to provide swingline borrowing capability. We utilize availability under our revolvers to manage our cash flows due to the seasonality of our business, and utilize any cash on hand in excess of current operating requirements to invest in our business and reduce borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, our total net liquidity was approximately $124.7 million, including $7.9 million of cash and $116.8 million of revolving credit facility availability. As of December 31, 2018, there was $0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding and $308 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. As of February 8, 2019, our availability under our revolving credit facility was approximately $132.8 million.\nWe issue debt securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce revolver debt, fund construction programs and for other general corporate purposes. To fund our strategic growth opportunities we utilize available cash flow, debt capacity and equity issuances that allows us to maintain investment grade ratings.\nIn September 2017, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith, Incorporated and J. P. Morgan Securities LLC, collectively the sales agents, pursuant to which we offered and sold shares of our common stock from time to time, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100 million. We concluded this program during the second quarter of 2018. During 2018, we issued 835,765 shares of our common stock at an average price of $54.45, for net proceeds of $44.9 million. Since inception of the program, we sold 1,724,703 shares of our common stock at an average price of $57.98 per share. Net proceeds received were approximately $98.5 million, which are net of sales commissions and other fees paid of approximately $1.4 million.\nWe plan to maintain a 50 - 55% debt to total capital ratio excluding capital leases, and expect to continue targeting a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60 - 70% of earnings per share; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these targets.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and eliminated bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. This reduction in federal income taxes results in lower regulated customer rates as discussed above in Significant Trends and Regulation. However, due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our future federal corporate income tax payments will also be reduced. Due to our existing Net Operating Loss (NOL) position and other tax credits, we expect to be a federal cash tax payer during 2020, with credits reducing our cash tax obligation into 2022. The reduction in revenues collected from customers is expected to negatively impact our 2019 cash flows from operations by approximately $20 million to $22 million.\nCredit Ratings\nIn general, less favorable credit ratings make debt financing more costly and more difficult to obtain on terms that are favorable to us and our customers, may impact our trade credit availability, and could result in the need to issue additional equity securities. Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and Standard and Poor's Ratings Service (S&P) are independent credit-rating agencies that rate our debt securities. These ratings indicate the agencies' assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our debt. As of February 8, 2019, our current ratings with these agencies are as follows:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Senior Secured Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Unsecured Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch (1)\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>F2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's (2)\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prime-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\n(1) In February 2018, Fitch affirmed our ratings, but revised our outlook from stable to negative citing continued regulatory headwinds in Montana and expected weakness in leverage metrics through 2021. Fitch also indicated that an adverse outcome in either our Montana electric supply tracker docket or our electric general rate case would likely result in a one-notch downgrade.\n(2) In May 2018, Moody's downgraded our senior secured rating to A3 from A2, and our unsecured credit rating to Baa2 from Baa1 and revised our outlook from negative to stable. Moody's cited an extended period of weak financial metrics and challenging regulatory relationship in Montana as reasons for the downgrade.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nCapital Requirements\nOur capital expenditures program is subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, changing business operating conditions and other business factors. We anticipate funding capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, available credit sources, debt and equity issuances and future rate increases. Our estimated capital expenditures are discussed above in the \"Investment\" section.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nWe have a variety of contractual obligations and other commitments that require payment of cash at certain specified periods. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018.

The pension and other postretirement benefit estimates reflect our expected cash contributions, which may be in excess of minimum funding requirements. \n (3) Certain QFs require us to purchase minimum amounts of energy at prices ranging from $63 to $136 per MWH through 2029. Our estimated gross contractual obligation related to these QFs is approximately $709.8 million. A portion of the costs incurred to purchase this energy is recoverable through rates authorized by the MPSC, totaling approximately $567.2 million. \n (4) We have entered into various purchase commitments, largely purchased power, electric transmission, coal and natural gas supply and natural gas transportation contracts. These commitments range from one to 25 years. \n (5) Contractual interest payments includes our revolving credit facilities, which have a variable interest rate. We have assumed an average interest rate of 3.76% on the outstanding balance through maturity of the facilities. \n (6) Potential tax payments related to uncertain tax positions are not practicable to estimate and have been excluded from this table. \nFactors Impacting our Liquidity\nSupply Costs - Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from natural gas and electric sales typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows and utilization of our existing revolver, are used to purchase natural gas to place in storage, perform maintenance and make capital improvements.\nThe effect of this seasonality on our liquidity is also impacted by changes in the market prices of our electric and natural gas supply, which is currently recovered through various monthly cost tracking mechanisms. These energy supply tracking mechanisms are designed to provide stable and timely recovery of supply costs on a monthly basis during the July to June annual tracking period, with an adjustment in the following annual tracking period to correct for any under or over collection in our monthly trackers. Due to the lag between our purchases of electric and natural gas commodities and revenue receipt from customers, cyclical over and under collection situations arise consistent with the seasonal fluctuations discussed above; therefore we usually under collect in the fall and winter and over collect in the spring. Fluctuations in recoveries under our cost tracking mechanisms can have a significant effect on cash flows from operations and make year-to-year comparisons difficult. In 2017, a Montana statute that provided for mandatory recovery of our prudently incurred electric supply costs was amended, and that statute now gives the MPSC discretion as to whether to approve electric supply costs. In the third quarter of 2018, the MPSC voted to approve a mechanism for recovery of electric supply costs that includes a sharing of costs beyond a\nspecified deadband above or below baseline costs, which may impact our cash flows. See Note 4 - Regulatory Matters, for further discussion of this docket.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are over collected on our natural gas and electric trackers by approximately $1.5 million, as compared with under collections of $13.2 million as of December 31, 2017, and $11.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash adjustments to net income\n</td> <td>169.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in working capital\n</td> <td>51.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other noncurrent assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>(36.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>382.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, plant and equipment additions\n</td> <td>(284.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(276.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(287.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>(18.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of assets\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in equity securities\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(304.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(276.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuances of long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit borrowings, net\n</td> <td>308.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Repayments) issuances of short-term borrowings, net\n</td> <td>(319.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends on common stock\n</td> <td>(109.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing costs\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(73.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $15.3 million as compared with $12.0 million at December 31, 2017. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $382.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $322.7 million during 2017. This increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to higher net income, improved customer receipts, and the receipt of insurance proceeds during the current period.\nOur 2017 operating cash flows increased by approximately $35.9 million as compared with 2016. This increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to customer refunds in 2016 associated with the DGGS FERC ruling and interim rates in our South Dakota electric rate case of approximately $30.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, and to higher net income after non-cash adjustments during 2017.\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $304.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $276.0 million during 2017, and $286.5 million in 2016. Plant additions during 2018 include maintenance additions of approximately $227.0 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $57.0 million, and the acquisition of the 9.7 MW Two Dot wind project in Montana for approximately $18.5 million. Plant additions during 2017 include maintenance additions of approximately $161.9 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $77.3 million, and infrastructure capital expenditures of approximately $37.2 million. Plant additions during 2016 include maintenance additions of approximately $158.6 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $79.0 million, and infrastructure capital expenditures of approximately $50.3 million.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities totaled $73.8 million during 2018 as compared to $44.2 million during 2017 and $9.4 million during 2016. During 2018, net cash used in financing activities reflects net repayments of commercial paper of $319.6 million and the payments of dividends of $109.2 million, partially offset by net issuances under our revolving lines of credit of $308.0 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $44.8 million. During 2017, net cash used in financing activities includes the payment of dividends of $101.3 million and the payment of financing costs of $16.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $53.7 million and net issuances of commercial paper of $18.7 million. During 2016, net cash used in financing activities includes the payment of dividends of $95.8 million and the payment of financing costs of $8.4 million, partially offset by net issuances of commercial paper of $70.9 million and net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $24.5 million.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be proper and reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the appropriateness of our estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider an estimate to be critical if it is material to the Consolidated Financial Statements and it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\nWe have identified the policies and related procedures below as critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these polices affect the reported amounts of revenue and are the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOur operations are subject to the provisions of ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980). Our regulatory assets are the probable future revenues associated with certain costs to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process, including our estimate of amounts recoverable for natural gas and electric supply purchases. Regulatory liabilities are the probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. This accounting treatment is impacted by the uncertainties of our regulatory environment, anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact. If any part of our operations becomes no longer subject to the provisions of ASC 980, or facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery, we would record a charge to earnings, which could be material. In addition, we would need to determine if there was any impairment to the carrying costs of the associated plant and inventory assets.\nWhile we believe that our assumptions regarding future regulatory actions are reasonable, different assumptions could materially affect our results. See Note 5 - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor and/or contribute to pension, postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Our reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits, as described in Note 15 - Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are dependent upon numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, rate of return on plan assets and other economic conditions, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. As a result of these factors, significant portions of pension and other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect (and are generally greater than) the actual benefits provided to plan participants. Due to the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of the obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, the determination of these costs is considered a critical accounting estimate.\nAssumptions\nKey actuarial assumptions utilized in determining these costs include:\n \u2022 Discount rates used in determining the future benefit obligations; \n \u2022 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and \n \u2022 Mortality assumptions. \nWe review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary. The assumptions are based upon market interest rates, past experience and management's best estimate of future economic conditions.\nWe set the discount rate using a yield curve analysis, which projects benefit cash flows into the future and then discounts those cash flows to the measurement date using a yield curve. This is done by constructing a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities matches the year-by-year, projected benefit cash flow from our plans. Based on this\nanalysis as of December 31, 2018, our discount rate on the NorthWestern Corporation pension plan is 4.15% and on the NorthWestern Energy pension plan is 4.20%.\nIn determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we review historical returns, the future expectations for returns for each asset class weighted by the target asset allocation of the pension and postretirement portfolios, and long-term inflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption are 4.23% and 5.06% on the NorthWestern Corporation and NorthWestern Energy pension plan, respectively, for 2019.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of pension costs to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (in thousands):\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Pension Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Projected\nBenefit Obligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,435\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting Treatment\nWe recognize the funded status of each plan as an asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and are recognized into earnings only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, which reduces the volatility of reported pension costs. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nDue to the various regulatory treatments of the plans, our financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating us. Pension costs in Montana and other postretirement benefit costs in South Dakota are included in rates on a pay as you go basis for regulatory purposes. Pension costs in South Dakota and other postretirement benefit costs in Montana are included in rates on an accrual basis for regulatory purposes. Regulatory assets have been recognized for the obligations that will be included in future cost of service.\nIncome Taxes\nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes from temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Exposures exist related to various tax filing positions, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments by taxing authorities. We have reduced deferred tax assets or established liabilities based on our best estimate of future probable adjustments related to these exposures. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate exposures in light of any additional information and make adjustments as necessary to reflect the best estimate of the future outcomes. We currently estimate that as of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $258 million of consolidated NOLs prior to consideration of unrecognized tax benefits to offset federal taxable income in future years. We believe our deferred tax assets and established liabilities are appropriate for estimated exposures; however, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.\nThe interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. The uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes is accounted for by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. We recognize tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We have unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $56.2 million as of December 31, 2018. The resolution of tax matters in a\nparticular future period could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes, results of operations and our cash flows.\nQualifying Facilities Liability\nOur electric QF liability consists of unrecoverable costs associated with contracts covered under PURPA that are part of a 2002 stipulation with the MPSC and other parties. Under the terms of these contracts, we are required to purchase minimum amounts of energy at prices ranging from $63 to $136 per MWH through 2029. Our estimated gross contractual obligation is approximately $709.8 million through 2029. A portion of the costs incurred to purchase this energy is recoverable through rates, totaling approximately $567.2 million through 2029. We maintain an electric QF liability based on the net present value (discounted at 7.75%) of the difference between our estimated obligations under the QFs and the fixed amounts recoverable in rates.\nThe liability was established based on certain assumptions and projections over the contract terms related to pricing, estimated output and recoverable amounts. Since the liability is based on projections over the next several years, actual output, changes in pricing, contract amendments and regulatory decisions relating to these facilities could significantly impact the liability and our results of operations in any given year. In assessing the liability each reporting period, we compare our assumptions to actual results and make adjustments as necessary for that period.\nOne of the contracts contains variable pricing terms, which exposes us to price escalation risks. The estimated annual escalation rate for this contract is a key assumption and is based on a combination of historical actual results and market data available for future projections. In recording the electric QF liability, we estimated an annual escalation rate of 3% over the remaining term of the contract (through June 2024). The actual escalation rate changes annually, which could significantly impact the liability and our results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein for a discussion of new accounting standards.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information related to our segments, see Note 21 - Segment and Related Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 herein. For information regarding our revenues, net income and assets, see our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.\n OVERVIEW \nNorthWestern Corporation, doing business as NorthWestern Energy, provides electricity and natural gas to approximately 726,400 customers in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. As you read this discussion and analysis, refer to our Consolidated Statements of Income, which present the results of our operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Following is a discussion of our strategy and significant trends.\nWe are working to deliver safe, reliable and innovative energy solutions that create value for customers, communities, employees and investors. This includes bridging our history as a regulated utility safely providing low-cost and reliable service with our future as a globally-aware company offering a broader array of services performed by highly-adaptable and skilled employees. We seek to deliver value to our customers by providing high reliability and customer service, and an environmentally sustainable generation mix at an affordable price. We are focused on delivering long-term shareholder value by continuing to invest in our system including:\n \u2022 Infrastructure investment focused on a stronger and smarter grid to improve the customer experience, while enhancing grid reliability and safety. This includes automation in distribution and substations that enables the use of changing technology. \n \u2022 Integrating supply resources that balance reliability, cost, capacity, and sustainability considerations with more predictable long-term commodity prices. \n \u2022 Continually improving our operating efficiency. Financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized return on invested capital and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings. \nWe expect to pursue these investment opportunities and manage our business in a manner that allows us to be flexible in adjusting to changing economic conditions by adjusting the timing and scale of the projects.\n\n\nConsolidated net income in 2018 was $197.0 million as compared with $162.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a gain related to the adjustment of our electric QF liability, the net impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, demand for electric transmission, favorable weather, and lower labor costs, partly offset by an increase in depreciation and depletion expense and an increase in expense associated with removing hazard trees outside of our electric transmission and distribution lines rights of way.\n\nMontana General Electric Rate Case\nIn September 2018, we filed an electric rate case with the MPSC requesting an annual increase to electric rates of approximately $34.9 million, which represents an approximate 6.6% increase in annual base revenues. Our request is based on a return on equity of 10.65% and an overall rate of return of 7.42% (except for Colstrip Unit 4 which the MPSC previously set for the life of the facility at a 10% return on equity and an 8.25% rate of return), based on approximately $2.35 billion of electric rate base and a capital structure of 51 percent debt and 49 percent equity.\nWe also requested that approximately $13.8 million of the rate increase be approved on an interim basis effective November 1, 2018. We expect to receive a decision on our interim request after intervenor testimony is filed. If the MPSC does not issue a final order within nine months of the filing, the new requested rates may be placed into effect on an interim and refundable basis.\nKey dates in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:\n \u2022 Intervenor testimony - February 12, 2019 \n \u2022 NorthWestern rebuttal testimony and cross-intervenor testimony - April 5, 2019 \n \u2022 Hearing commences - May 13, 2019 \nWe expect to file a FERC rate case for our Montana transmission assets by the end of the first quarter of 2019. The revenue requirement associated with our Montana FERC assets is reflected in our MPSC jurisdictional rates as a credit to customers.\nElectric Resource Planning - Montana\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we expect to submit our draft 2019 Electricity Supply Resource Procurement Plan (Montana Resource Plan) with the MPSC. The Montana Resource Plan supports the goal of developing resources that will address the changing energy landscape in Montana to meet our customers' electric energy needs in a reliable and affordable manner. A\nsummary of the draft Montana Resource Plan was provided for public comment in January 2019. After submission to the MPSC, the draft will be available for public comment for 60 days.\nMontana is in the midst of a transition from producing more energy than is needed in the state with energy exported to the west, to a growing risk of not having enough capacity to serve Montana customers at critical times of peak load due to reductions in regional and in state energy generation as noted below:\n \u2022 Our current peak requirement for energy is about 1,400 MW. We are currently 630 MW short, which is subject to market purchases. We forecast that our energy portfolio will be 725 MW short by 2025 with modest increased customer demand. \n \u2022 Planned regional retirements of 3,500 MW of coal-fired generation are forecast by the Northwest Power and Conservation Council to cause regional peak energy shortages as early as 2021. \nThe long-term objective of the Montana Resource Plan is a clean, cost-effective, stable and reliable energy portfolio. Based on our customers' future energy resource needs as identified in 2019, we expect to solicit competitive proposals for up to 200 MW of peaking capacity available by 2022, which is about one-fourth of our projected need in 2025. An independent evaluator will be used to assess the proposals. We expect the process will be repeated in subsequent years to provide a resource-adequate energy and capacity portfolio. Using this staged approach, we propose to add 200 MWs of capacity per year from 2022 to 2025.\nThe proposal solicitation process will consider a wide variety of resource options and sizing, ownership options and contract lengths. This includes power purchase agreements and owned energy resources comprised of different structures, terms and technologies that are cost-effective resources. The staged approach is designed to allow for incremental steps through time with opportunities for different resource type of new technologies while also building a reliable portfolio to meet local and regional conditions and minimizing customer impacts.\nWestern Energy Imbalance Market\nIn November 2018, we announced our intent to enter the Western EIM, operated by the California ISO, in the spring of 2021. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Participation in the Western EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. In order to participate in the Western EIM, we must demonstrate resource adequacy through a combination of owned or contracted resources.\nAssumptions regarding entry into the Western EIM are incorporated into our Montana Resource Plan. In early 2018, the California ISO began a process to enhance the day-ahead market within the full Independent System Operator's footprint (the EDAM initiative). The enhancements to the day-ahead market are targeted to go live in 2019 with a platform that will allow the addition of a day-ahead market to the Western EIM. The extension of EDAM to EIM participants has not yet been formally introduced as a stakeholder process, but if current EIM members and the California ISO support moving forward, a stakeholder process will be initiated regarding the day-ahead EIM that could go live as early as 2022. Our Montana Resource Plan assumes that EIM entry will occur in 2021, followed by EDAM entry in 2022 and the development of a full market with an independent system operator in 2025.\nElectric Resource Planning - South Dakota\nOur 2018 South Dakota Electricity Supply Resource Procurement Plan (South Dakota Resource Plan) identified approximately 90MWs of existing generation that should be retired and replaced over the next 10 years with the goal of improving reliability and lowering operating costs. We expect to issue a request for proposal in the second quarter of 2019 to replace 60 MW of combustion turbine generation by December 2021, comparing the relative costs of the addition of a reciprocating internal combustion engine facility to other market offerings. In addition, we are currently installing 8 MW of mobile capacity generation, with units expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nPURPA\nPURPA requires us to purchase power from qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities at a price approved by the MPSC that is meant to represent our avoided cost\u201d of generating power or purchasing power from another source. The cost to procure power from these QFs may not be a cost effective resource for customers, or the type of generation resource needed, resulting in increased supply costs that are inconsistent with resource plans developed based on a lowest cost and least risk basis while placing upward pressure on overall customer bills. Although the costs incurred to purchase power\nfrom QFs are passed on to customers, subject to the cost recovery mechanism discussed below, mandated purchases of QF generation, potentially at above-market prices, may reduce the need for new owned generation. This in turn could have a material adverse effect on our long-term capital investment plan and the affordability of future customer prices. We expect to establish a current avoided cost in Montana in conjunction with our Montana Resource Plan.\nColstrip\nColstrip Units 3 and 4 are supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under coal supply and transportation agreements with WeCo in effect through 2019. WeCo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2018. An auction was held for the core assets in January 2019, including the mine adjacent to Colstrip, with no qualified bids received. As a result a lenders group is expected to acquire the core assets. During the course of the bankruptcy, WeCo may choose to assume or reject the existing coal supply and transportation agreements. WeCo indicated that it intends to reject the existing cost plus coal supply agreement. If WeCo rejects the existing agreement, the fuel supply to Units 3 and 4 may be interrupted until new arrangements are in place. In addition, any new arrangements may have higher costs than the existing cost plus agreement.\nHazard Trees\nHazard trees are those trees that are structurally unsound and could fall into our lines if the trees failed. Hazard trees may be located inside or outside our electric transmission and distribution lines' rights of way and pose risks to our system including disruption of service, property damage, loss of life, and/or fires. We are facing challenges to address these trees. Beetle infestations have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber and have impacted our system for quite some time. As part of our normal vegetation management program, we have routinely removed trees from within our rights of way, including those infected by the beetle infestation. Additionally, in some circumstances, we were authorized to remove one or more hazard trees from outside of our rights of way that could harm our system.\nThe beetle infestation exacerbates the risk of fires in Montana, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire. Fires alleged to have been caused by our system could expose us to significant damage claims on theories such as strict liability, negligence, gross negligence, trespass, inverse condemnation, and others. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe worked with third parties, including the U.S. Forest Service, to develop a plan to remove these hazard trees. We identified areas severely impacted and determined that the only way to mitigate fire and reliability risk along these lines is to clear-cut all of the trees on either side of the electric lines that could hit the lines, if they fell. In most cases, this results in a corridor of approximately 100 feet on either side of the lines. Normal rights of way vary but are generally 20 feet to 40 feet wide on distribution lines and 40 feet to 100 feet wide on transmission lines. We finalized our plan to address the identified areas in the first quarter of 2018 and began work.\n \u2022 During 2018, we incurred approximately $3.3 million in costs related to this work, which is incremental to costs for vegetation management within our rights of way. We expect to continue the program over the next several years with anticipated 2019 costs ranging from approximately $7 million to $9 million, with total costs exceeding $20 million. \nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which enacts significant changes to U.S. tax and related laws. The primary impact to us is a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Dockets were opened in each of our jurisdictions to investigate the customer benefit of this reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. During 2018, we received approval of settlement agreements regarding the customer benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as described below.\n \u2022 In Montana the settlement provides a one-time credit of approximately $20.5 million to customers in early 2019. This includes a $19.2 million credit to electric customers and $1.3 million credit to natural gas customers. \n \u25e6 In addition to eligible customers receiving a one-time bill credit, the settlement also reduces rates for all natural gas customers by approximately $1.3 million annually beginning January 1, 2019, and provides funds for low-income energy assistance and weatherization programs. \n \u25e6 The settlement also reflects the agreement of the intervening parties not to oppose our request to include up to $3.5 million of costs to address hazard tree removal in our current Montana rate case. \n \u25e6 Issues related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes will be addressed in our current Montana rate case. \n \u2022 In South Dakota we credited electric and natural gas customers approximately $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, and agreed to a two-year rate moratorium until January 1, 2021. \nOur 2018 results include a net benefit related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes:\n \u2022 An income tax benefit of approximately $19.8 million due to the finalization of the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities upon completion of the associated regulatory dockets; offset by \n \u2022 A net loss of approximately $6.1 million including a reduction in revenue of approximately $23.5 million, due to customer credits in the above regulatory settlements, offset in part by a reduction in income tax expense, of approximately $17.4 million due to the reduction in federal tax rate. \nIn addition, we reflected the costs of our hazard tree program in the consolidated income statement as we agreed in our Montana settlement to request recovery of these costs in base customer rates in our 2018 filing, as discussed above, rather than using a portion of the reduction in customer rates associated with the change in tax rate as proposed in our Montana Tax Cuts and Jobs Act filing.\nWe expect a consolidated reduction in our cash flows from operations ranging from $20 million to $22 million in 2019, as a result of the customer credits discussed above while we are not a cash taxpayer. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. We currently estimate that our effective income tax rate will range from 0% to 5% in 2019.\nCost Recovery Mechanisms\nElectric Tracker - Effective July 1, 2017, the Montana legislature granted the MPSC discretion whether to approve an electric supply tracking mechanism. After considering our application in a contested case proceeding, the MPSC issued a final order in January 2019 approving a PCCAM with the following provisions:\n \u2022 A baseline of power supply costs; \n \u2022 Annual adjustment of customer prices to reflect a portion of the difference between the established base revenues and actual costs, to the extent such difference is outside a +/- $4.1 million \"deadband\" from the base, with 90% of the variance above or below the deadband collected from or refunded to customers; and \n \u2022 Retroactive implementation to the effective date of the new legislation (July 1, 2017). \nOur 2018 results include a net reduction in the recovery of supply costs from customers of approximately $1.5 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which includes the following:\n \u2022 For the 2017/2018 period, actual costs were below base revenues by approximately $3.4 million, resulting in no refund to customers. \n \u2022 For the 2018/2019 period, actual costs were above base revenues by approximately $11.8 million, resulting in a regulatory asset for collection from customers of approximately $6.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and an approximately $4.9 million reduction in recovery of supply costs for the first six months of the period. For further discussion, see Results of Operations below. \n INVESTMENT \nOur estimated capital expenditures for the next five years, including our electric and natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure investment plan, are as follows (in millions):\nDistribution and Transmission Modernization and Maintenance - As part of our commitment to maintain high level reliability and system performance we continue to evaluate the condition of our distribution and transmission assets to address aging infrastructure through our asset management process. The primary goals of our infrastructure investment are to reverse the trend in aging infrastructure, maintain reliability, proactively manage safety, build capacity into the system, and prepare our network for the adoption of new technologies. We are taking a proactive and pragmatic approach to replace these assets while also evaluating the implementation of additional technologies to prepare the overall system for smart grid applications. We are currently installing Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in our South Dakota and Nebraska jurisdictions. This project is expected to be completed in 2019 at a total cost of approximately $32 million. In Montana we are developing a similar AMI project to be started in 2020. While this project is still in the evaluation phase, we estimate our total AMI capital expenditures across all of our service territories to be in the range of approximately $100 to $110 million if fully deployed.\nElectric Supply Resource Plans - Our energy resource plans discussed above identify portfolio resource requirements including potential investments. While our resource plans identify needs, any owned generation is subject to successful completion of the competitive solicitation process and are not reflected in the projections above. We anticipate that owned assets to address energy and capacity needs for both Montana and South Dakota could increase the capital forecast presented above in excess of $200 million over the next five years.\nNatural Gas Production Assets - We own natural gas production and gathering system assets in Montana as a part of an overall strategy to provide rate stability and customer value through the addition of regulated assets that are not subject to market forces. Our estimated capital expenditure requirements above do not include estimates for incremental natural gas reserve acquisitions, potential peaking generation needs or other investment opportunities that may arise.\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nOur consolidated results include the results of our divisions and subsidiaries constituting each of our business segments. The overall consolidated discussion is followed by a detailed discussion of gross margin by segment.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as another financial measure, Gross Margin, that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\u201d Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Gross Margin as Revenues less Cost of Sales as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nManagement believes that Gross Margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms. This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of results. Under our various state regulatory mechanisms, as detailed below, our supply costs are generally collected from customers, and as a result do not typically impact operating or net income. In addition, Gross Margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs, as well as to analyze how changes in loads (due to weather, economic or other conditions), rates and other factors impact our results of operations. Our Gross Margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies' presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nOur revenues may fluctuate substantially with changes in supply costs, which are generally collected in rates from customers. In addition, various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas utility service within their respective jurisdictions and regulate our ability to recover costs from customers.\nRevenues are also impacted by customer growth and usage, the latter of which is primarily affected by weather. Very cold winters increase demand for natural gas and to a lesser extent, electricity, while warmer than normal summers increase demand for electricity, especially among our residential and commercial customers. We measure this effect using degree-days, which is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of 65 degrees. Heating degree-days result when the average daily temperature is less than the baseline. Cooling degree-days result when the average daily temperature is greater than the baseline. The statistical weather information in our regulated segments represents a comparison of this data.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" above.\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" above.\nPrimary components of the change in gross margin include the following (in millions):\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" above.\nConsolidated gross margin for items impacting net income increased $30.0 million, due to the following:\n \u2022 A reduction in the electric QF liability due to the combination of (i) a periodic adjustment of the liability for price escalation, which was less than modeled resulting in a liability reduction of approximately $17.5 million; and (ii) the annual reset to actual output and pricing resulting in approximately $7.6 million in lower QF related supply costs due to outages at two facilities; \n \u2022 Higher demand to transmit energy across our transmission lines due to market conditions and pricing; \n \u2022 An increase in electric and natural gas retail volumes due primarily to customer growth and favorable weather in South Dakota; and \n \u2022 An increase in our Montana gas rates effective September 1, 2017. \nThese increases were partly offset by a $6.1 million reduction in revenue due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act settlement and a $1.5 million reduction in recovery of Montana electric supply costs, as discussed above in Significant Trends and Regulation.\nThe change in consolidated gross margin also includes the following items that had no impact on net income:\n \u2022 A reduction in revenue in 2018 to reflect the pass-through of the Tax Cuts and Job Act related benefits to customers, which is offset by a decrease in income tax expense; \n \u2022 A decrease in natural gas gathering fees which are offset by reduced operating expenses; \n \u2022 A decrease in natural gas production taxes which are offset by reduced property and other taxes; \n \u2022 An increase in revenues for property taxes included in trackers, which are offset by increased property tax expense; and \n \u2022 An increase in revenue due to decreased production tax credit benefits passed through to customers in our tracker mechanisms, which is offset by increased income tax expense. \n\nConsolidated operating, general and administrative expenses were $307.1 million in 2018, as compared with $294.8 million in 2017. Primary components of the change include the following (in millions):\n\nConsolidated operating, general and administrative expenses for items impacting net income increased $2.1 million due to the following:\n \u2022 An increase in employee benefit costs, primarily due to higher medical and employee incentive expense; and \n \u2022 Costs incurred in 2018 to remove hazard trees outside of our electric transmission and distribution lines rights of way. \nThese increases were partly offset by the following:\n \u2022 Lower expenses related to the Distribution System Infrastructure Project, which concluded in 2017; \n \u2022 Decreased labor costs due primarily to fewer employees and more time being spent by employees on capital projects rather than maintenance projects (which are expensed); and \n \u2022 Lower maintenance costs at electric generating facilities. \nThe change in consolidated operating, general and administrative expenses also includes the following items that had no impact on net income:\n \u2022 The regulatory treatment of the non-service cost components of pension and postretirement benefit expense, which is offset in other income; \n \u2022 Higher operating expenses included in trackers and recovered in revenue; \n \u2022 A change in the value of non-employee directors deferred compensation due to the change in our stock price, which is offset in other income; and \n \u2022 Lower gas gathering fees and production taxes, which is offset by lower margin discussed above. \nProperty and other taxes were $171.3 million in 2018, as compared with $162.6 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to plant additions and higher estimated property valuations in Montana. Under Montana law, we are allowed to track the changes in the actual level of state and local taxes and fees and recover 74% of the increase in taxes and fees, which is net of the associated income tax benefit.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $174.5 million in 2018, as compared with $166.1 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to plant additions.\nConsolidated operating income in 2018 was $266.3 million as compared with $271.7 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the overall increase in operating expenses, as discussed above, offset in part by higher gross margin.\nConsolidated interest expense in 2018 was $92.0 million, as compared with $92.3 million in 2017. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information regarding our financing activities.\nConsolidated other income in 2018, was $4.0 million, as compared with consolidated other expense of $3.4 million in 2017. This increase includes a $10.3 million decrease in other pension expense (which is offset in operating, general, and administrative expenses), partly offset by lower capitalization of AFUDC.\nConsolidated income tax benefit in 2018 was $18.7 million, as compared with consolidated income tax expense of $13.4 million in 2017. Our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was (10.5)% as compared with 7.6% for the same period of 2017. The decrease in income tax expense in 2018 is primarily due to the impact of the lower federal tax rate and a benefit of approximately $19.8 million associated with the final measurement of excess deferred taxes.\nThe following table summarizes the differences between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate (in millions):\n\nConsolidated net income in 2018 was $197.0 million as compared with $162.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to a gain related to the adjustment of our electric QF liability, demand for electric transmission, customer growth and favorable weather, and an income tax benefit associated with the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partly offset by an increase in depreciation expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" above.\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" above.\nConsolidated gross margin in 2017 was $895.4 million, an increase of $39.1 million, or 4.6%, from gross margin in 2016. Factors that impacted gross margin included (in millions):\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" above.\nConsolidated gross margin for items impacting net income increased $30.9 million primarily due to the following:\n \u2022 An increase in electric retail volumes due primarily to colder winter and warmer summer weather in our Montana jurisdiction and customer growth, partly offset by cooler summer weather in our South Dakota jurisdiction and milder spring weather overall; \n \u2022 An increase in natural gas retail volumes due primarily to colder winter and spring weather and customer growth, partly offset by warmer summer weather; \n \u2022 The inclusion in our 2016 results of the MPSC disallowance of both replacement power costs from a 2013 outage at Colstrip Unit 4 and portfolio modeling costs; \n \u2022 An increase in our Montana gas rates effective September 1, 2017; \n \u2022 The inclusion in our 2016 results of a reduction in hydro generation rates due to the MPSC order in the hydro compliance filing; \n \u2022 An increase in South Dakota electric rates due to the timing of the change in customer rates in 2016; \n \u2022 Higher demand to transmit energy across our transmission lines due to market conditions and pricing; and \n \u2022 A decrease in QF related supply costs based on actual QF pricing and output. \nThese increases were partly offset by the inclusion in our 2016 results of $14.2 million of deferred revenue as a result of a MPSC final order in our tracker filings regarding prior period lost revenues.\nThe change in consolidated gross margin also includes the following items that had no impact on net income:\n \u2022 An increase in revenues for property taxes included in trackers is offset by increased property tax expense; and \n \u2022 An increase in operating expenses included in our supply trackers is offset by an increase in operating, general and administrative expenses. \n\nConsolidated operating, general and administrative expenses were $294.8 million in 2017 as compared with $293.9 million in 2016. Primary components of this change include the following (in millions):\n\nConsolidated operating, general and administrative expenses for items impacting net income increased $0.7 million primarily due to the following:\n \u2022 Higher bad debt expense due to an increase in revenues as a result of colder winter and warmer summer weather; and  \u2022Higher maintenance costs at our Dave Gates Generating Station and Colstrip Unit 4.\nThese increases were offset in part by:\n \u2022 A decrease in employee benefits due primarily to lower pension costs, offset in part by higher medical costs and more time spent by employees on maintenance projects (which are expensed) rather than capital projects; and \n \u2022 A decrease in insurance reserves primarily due to the amount recorded in 2016 related to the Billings, Montana refinery outage. \nThe change in consolidated operating, general and administrative expenses also includes the following items that had no impact on net income:\n \u2022 Higher operating expenses recovered through our supply trackers; and \n \u2022 The regulatory treatment of the non-service cost component of pension and postretirement benefit expense, offset in other income. \nProperty and other taxes were $162.6 million in 2017 as compared with $148.1 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to plant additions and higher estimated property valuations in Montana.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $166.1 million in 2017 as compared with $159.3 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to plant additions.\nConsolidated operating income in 2017 was $271.7 million, as compared with $255.0 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in gross margin as discussed above, offset in part by higher operating expenses.\nConsolidated interest expense in 2017 was $92.3 million, as compared with $95.0 million, in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the refinancing of debt in 2016. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information regarding our financing activities.\nConsolidated other income in 2017 was $3.4 million as compared with $3.5 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in other pension expense, offset in part by higher capitalization of AFUDC.\nConsolidated income tax expense in 2017 was $13.4 million as compared with an income tax benefit of $7.6 million in 2016. Our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 7.6% as compared with (4.9)% for the same period of 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $17.0 million due to the adoption of a tax accounting method change related to the costs to repair generation assets, which allowed us to take a current tax deduction for a significant amount of repair costs that were previously capitalized for tax purposes. Approximately $12.5 million of this deduction related to 2015 and prior tax years. This is reflected in the flow-through repairs deductions line due to the regulatory treatment.\nOur effective tax rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the regulatory impact of flowing through the federal and state tax benefit of repairs deductions, state tax benefit of accelerated tax depreciation deductions (including bonus depreciation when applicable) and production tax credits. The following table summarizes the differences between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate (in millions):\n\nConsolidated net income in 2017 was $162.7 million as compared with $164.2 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in our 2016 results of a $17.0 million income tax benefit due to the adoption of a tax accounting method change related to the costs to repair generation assets, and higher operating expenses as discussed above, offset in part by improved gross margin as a result of favorable weather, and to a lesser extent, by customer growth.\n\nWe have various classifications of electric revenues, defined as follows:\n \u2022 Retail: Sales of electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers. \n \u2022 Regulatory amortization: Primarily represents timing differences for electric supply costs and property taxes between when we incur these costs and when we recover these costs in rates from our customers. \n \u2022 Transmission: Reflects transmission revenues regulated by the FERC. \n \u2022 Wholesale and other are largely gross margin neutral as they are offset by changes in cost of sales. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure.

The increase in revenues for property taxes included in trackers is offset by increased property tax expense with no impact to net income.\n\nWe require liquidity to support and grow our business, and use our liquidity for working capital needs, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets, and to repay debt. We believe our cash flows from operations and existing borrowing capacity should be sufficient to fund our operations, service existing debt, pay dividends, and fund capital expenditures (excluding strategic growth opportunities). The amount of capital expenditures and dividends are subject to certain factors including the use of existing cash, cash equivalents and the receipt of cash from operations. In addition, a material change in operations or available financing could impact our current liquidity and ability to fund capital resource requirements, and we may defer a portion of our planned capital expenditures as necessary.\nLiquidity is provided by internal cash flows and the use of our unsecured revolving credit facility. We have a $400 million revolving credit facility. In addition, on March 27, 2018, we entered into a $25 million revolving credit facility, maturing March 27, 2020, to provide swingline borrowing capability. We utilize availability under our revolvers to manage our cash flows due to the seasonality of our business, and utilize any cash on hand in excess of current operating requirements to invest in our business and reduce borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, our total net liquidity was approximately $124.7 million, including $7.9 million of cash and $116.8 million of revolving credit facility availability. As of December 31, 2018, there was $0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding and $308 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. As of February 8, 2019, our availability under our revolving credit facility was approximately $132.8 million.\nWe issue debt securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce revolver debt, fund construction programs and for other general corporate purposes. To fund our strategic growth opportunities we utilize available cash flow, debt capacity and equity issuances that allows us to maintain investment grade ratings.\nIn September 2017, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith, Incorporated and J. P. Morgan Securities LLC, collectively the sales agents, pursuant to which we offered and sold shares of our common stock from time to time, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100 million. We concluded this program during the second quarter of 2018. During 2018, we issued 835,765 shares of our common stock at an average price of $54.45, for net proceeds of $44.9 million. Since inception of the program, we sold 1,724,703 shares of our common stock at an average price of $57.98 per share. Net proceeds received were approximately $98.5 million, which are net of sales commissions and other fees paid of approximately $1.4 million.\nWe plan to maintain a 50 - 55% debt to total capital ratio excluding capital leases, and expect to continue targeting a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60 - 70% of earnings per share; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these targets.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and eliminated bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. This reduction in federal income taxes results in lower regulated customer rates as discussed above in Significant Trends and Regulation. However, due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our future federal corporate income tax payments will also be reduced. Due to our existing Net Operating Loss (NOL) position and other tax credits, we expect to be a federal cash tax payer during 2020, with credits reducing our cash tax obligation into 2022. The reduction in revenues collected from customers is expected to negatively impact our 2019 cash flows from operations by approximately $20 million to $22 million.\nCredit Ratings\nIn general, less favorable credit ratings make debt financing more costly and more difficult to obtain on terms that are favorable to us and our customers, may impact our trade credit availability, and could result in the need to issue additional equity securities. Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and Standard and Poor's Ratings Service (S&P) are independent credit-rating agencies that rate our debt securities. These ratings indicate the agencies' assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our debt. As of February 8, 2019, our current ratings with these agencies are as follows:\n\n_________________________\n(1) In February 2018, Fitch affirmed our ratings, but revised our outlook from stable to negative citing continued regulatory headwinds in Montana and expected weakness in leverage metrics through 2021. Fitch also indicated that an adverse outcome in either our Montana electric supply tracker docket or our electric general rate case would likely result in a one-notch downgrade.\n(2) In May 2018, Moody's downgraded our senior secured rating to A3 from A2, and our unsecured credit rating to Baa2 from Baa1 and revised our outlook from negative to stable. Moody's cited an extended period of weak financial metrics and challenging regulatory relationship in Montana as reasons for the downgrade.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nCapital Requirements\nOur capital expenditures program is subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, changing business operating conditions and other business factors. We anticipate funding capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, available credit sources, debt and equity issuances and future rate increases. Our estimated capital expenditures are discussed above in the \"Investment\" section.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nWe have a variety of contractual obligations and other commitments that require payment of cash at certain specified periods. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018. See additional discussion in Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n___________________________\n (1) Represents cash payments for long-term debt and excludes $12.3 million of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, net. \n (2) We have estimated cash obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit programs and environmental remediation obligations for five years, as it is not practicable to estimate thereafter. The pension and other postretirement benefit estimates reflect our expected cash contributions, which may be in excess of minimum funding requirements. \n (3) Certain QFs require us to purchase minimum amounts of energy at prices ranging from $63 to $136 per MWH through 2029. Our estimated gross contractual obligation related to these QFs is approximately $709.8 million. A portion of the costs incurred to purchase this energy is recoverable through rates authorized by the MPSC, totaling approximately $567.2 million. \n (4) We have entered into various purchase commitments, largely purchased power, electric transmission, coal and natural gas supply and natural gas transportation contracts. These commitments range from one to 25 years. \n (5) Contractual interest payments includes our revolving credit facilities, which have a variable interest rate. We have assumed an average interest rate of 3.76% on the outstanding balance through maturity of the facilities. \n (6) Potential tax payments related to uncertain tax positions are not practicable to estimate and have been excluded from this table. \nFactors Impacting our Liquidity\nSupply Costs - Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from natural gas and electric sales typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows and utilization of our existing revolver, are used to purchase natural gas to place in storage, perform maintenance and make capital improvements.\nThe effect of this seasonality on our liquidity is also impacted by changes in the market prices of our electric and natural gas supply, which is currently recovered through various monthly cost tracking mechanisms. These energy supply tracking mechanisms are designed to provide stable and timely recovery of supply costs on a monthly basis during the July to June annual tracking period, with an adjustment in the following annual tracking period to correct for any under or over collection in our monthly trackers. Due to the lag between our purchases of electric and natural gas commodities and revenue receipt from customers, cyclical over and under collection situations arise consistent with the seasonal fluctuations discussed above; therefore we usually under collect in the fall and winter and over collect in the spring. Fluctuations in recoveries under our cost tracking mechanisms can have a significant effect on cash flows from operations and make year-to-year comparisons difficult. In 2017, a Montana statute that provided for mandatory recovery of our prudently incurred electric supply costs was amended, and that statute now gives the MPSC discretion as to whether to approve electric supply costs. In the third quarter of 2018, the MPSC voted to approve a mechanism for recovery of electric supply costs that includes a sharing of costs beyond a\nspecified deadband above or below baseline costs, which may impact our cash flows. See Note 4 - Regulatory Matters, for further discussion of this docket.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are over collected on our natural gas and electric trackers by approximately $1.5 million, as compared with under collections of $13.2 million as of December 31, 2017, and $11.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\n\nCash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $15.3 million as compared with $12.0 million at December 31, 2017. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $382.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $322.7 million during 2017. This increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to higher net income, improved customer receipts, and the receipt of insurance proceeds during the current period.\nOur 2017 operating cash flows increased by approximately $35.9 million as compared with 2016. This increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to customer refunds in 2016 associated with the DGGS FERC ruling and interim rates in our South Dakota electric rate case of approximately $30.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, and to higher net income after non-cash adjustments during 2017.\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $304.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $276.0 million during 2017, and $286.5 million in 2016. Plant additions during 2018 include maintenance additions of approximately $227.0 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $57.0 million, and the acquisition of the 9.7 MW Two Dot wind project in Montana for approximately $18.5 million. Plant additions during 2017 include maintenance additions of approximately $161.9 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $77.3 million, and infrastructure capital expenditures of approximately $37.2 million. Plant additions during 2016 include maintenance additions of approximately $158.6 million, capacity related capital expenditures of approximately $79.0 million, and infrastructure capital expenditures of approximately $50.3 million.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities totaled $73.8 million during 2018 as compared to $44.2 million during 2017 and $9.4 million during 2016. During 2018, net cash used in financing activities reflects net repayments of commercial paper of $319.6 million and the payments of dividends of $109.2 million, partially offset by net issuances under our revolving lines of credit of $308.0 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $44.8 million. During 2017, net cash used in financing activities includes the payment of dividends of $101.3 million and the payment of financing costs of $16.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $53.7 million and net issuances of commercial paper of $18.7 million. During 2016, net cash used in financing activities includes the payment of dividends of $95.8 million and the payment of financing costs of $8.4 million, partially offset by net issuances of commercial paper of $70.9 million and net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $24.5 million.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be proper and reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the appropriateness of our estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider an estimate to be critical if it is material to the Consolidated Financial Statements and it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\nWe have identified the policies and related procedures below as critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these polices affect the reported amounts of revenue and are the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOur operations are subject to the provisions of ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980). Our regulatory assets are the probable future revenues associated with certain costs to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process, including our estimate of amounts recoverable for natural gas and electric supply purchases. Regulatory liabilities are the probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. This accounting treatment is impacted by the uncertainties of our regulatory environment, anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact. If any part of our operations becomes no longer subject to the provisions of ASC 980, or facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery, we would record a charge to earnings, which could be material. In addition, we would need to determine if there was any impairment to the carrying costs of the associated plant and inventory assets.\nWhile we believe that our assumptions regarding future regulatory actions are reasonable, different assumptions could materially affect our results. See Note 5 - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor and/or contribute to pension, postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. Our reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits, as described in Note 15 - Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are dependent upon numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, rate of return on plan assets and other economic conditions, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. As a result of these factors, significant portions of pension and other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect (and are generally greater than) the actual benefits provided to plan participants. Due to the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of the obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, the determination of these costs is considered a critical accounting estimate.\nAssumptions\nKey actuarial assumptions utilized in determining these costs include:\n \u2022 Discount rates used in determining the future benefit obligations; \n \u2022 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and \n \u2022 Mortality assumptions. \nWe review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary. The assumptions are based upon market interest rates, past experience and management's best estimate of future economic conditions.\nWe set the discount rate using a yield curve analysis, which projects benefit cash flows into the future and then discounts those cash flows to the measurement date using a yield curve. This is done by constructing a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities matches the year-by-year, projected benefit cash flow from our plans. Based on this\nanalysis as of December 31, 2018, our discount rate on the NorthWestern Corporation pension plan is 4.15% and on the NorthWestern Energy pension plan is 4.20%.\nIn determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we review historical returns, the future expectations for returns for each asset class weighted by the target asset allocation of the pension and postretirement portfolios, and long-term inflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption are 4.23% and 5.06% on the NorthWestern Corporation and NorthWestern Energy pension plan, respectively, for 2019.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of pension costs to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (in thousands):\n\nAccounting Treatment\nWe recognize the funded status of each plan as an asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and are recognized into earnings only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, which reduces the volatility of reported pension costs. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.\nDue to the various regulatory treatments of the plans, our financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating us. Pension costs in Montana and other postretirement benefit costs in South Dakota are included in rates on a pay as you go basis for regulatory purposes. Pension costs in South Dakota and other postretirement benefit costs in Montana are included in rates on an accrual basis for regulatory purposes. Regulatory assets have been recognized for the obligations that will be included in future cost of service.\nIncome Taxes\nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes from temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Exposures exist related to various tax filing positions, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments by taxing authorities. We have reduced deferred tax assets or established liabilities based on our best estimate of future probable adjustments related to these exposures. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate exposures in light of any additional information and make adjustments as necessary to reflect the best estimate of the future outcomes. We currently estimate that as of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $258 million of consolidated NOLs prior to consideration of unrecognized tax benefits to offset federal taxable income in future years. We believe our deferred tax assets and established liabilities are appropriate for estimated exposures; however, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.\nThe interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. The uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes is accounted for by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. We recognize tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We have unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $56.2 million as of December 31, 2018. The resolution of tax matters in a\nparticular future period could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes, results of operations and our cash flows.\nQualifying Facilities Liability\nOur electric QF liability consists of unrecoverable costs associated with contracts covered under PURPA that are part of a 2002 stipulation with the MPSC and other parties. Under the terms of these contracts, we are required to purchase minimum amounts of energy at prices ranging from $63 to $136 per MWH through 2029. Our estimated gross contractual obligation is approximately $709.8 million through 2029. A portion of the costs incurred to purchase this energy is recoverable through rates, totaling approximately $567.2 million through 2029. We maintain an electric QF liability based on the net present value (discounted at 7.75%) of the difference between our estimated obligations under the QFs and the fixed amounts recoverable in rates.\nThe liability was established based on certain assumptions and projections over the contract terms related to pricing, estimated output and recoverable amounts. Since the liability is based on projections over the next several years, actual output, changes in pricing, contract amendments and regulatory decisions relating to these facilities could significantly impact the liability and our results of operations in any given year. In assessing the liability each reporting period, we compare our assumptions to actual results and make adjustments as necessary for that period.\nOne of the contracts contains variable pricing terms, which exposes us to price escalation risks. The estimated annual escalation rate for this contract is a key assumption and is based on a combination of historical actual results and market data available for future projections. In recording the electric QF liability, we estimated an annual escalation rate of 3% over the remaining term of the contract (through June 2024). The actual escalation rate changes annually, which could significantly impact the liability and our results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, to
