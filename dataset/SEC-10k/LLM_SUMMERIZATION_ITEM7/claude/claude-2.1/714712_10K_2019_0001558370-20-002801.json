( Company\u201d or Juniata\u201d) and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Juniata Valley Bank ( Bank\u201d). Juniata is a bank holding company that delivers financial services within its market, primarily central Pennsylvania. The Bank provides retail and commercial banking, trust, estate, and wealth management services through 16 offices in Juniata, Mifflin, Perry, Huntingdon, McKean, Potter and Centre counties. On April 30, 2018, Juniata, which previously owned 39.16%, or 1,214 of the 3,100 outstanding common shares of Liverpool Community Bank ( Liverpool\u201d or LCB\u201d), completed the acquisition of the remainder of Liverpool's outstanding common stock. Under the terms of a merger agreement between the parties, LCB merged with and into the Bank.\nThe overview is intended to provide a context for the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have attempted to identify the most important matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and the short-term and long-term opportunities, challenges and risks (including material trends and uncertainties) which we face. We also discuss the actions we are taking to address these opportunities, challenges and risks. The Overview is not intended as a summary of, or a substitute for review of, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS RELEVANT TO JUNIATA\nAs a financial services organization, Juniata's core business is most influenced by the level of, and movement of, interest rates. Lending and investing are done daily, using funding from deposits and borrowings, resulting in net interest income, the most significant portion of operating results. Through the use of asset/liability management tools, the Company continually evaluates the effects that possible changes in interest rates could have on operating results and balance sheet growth. Using this information, along with analysis of competitive factors, management designs and prices its products and services.\nGeneral economic conditions are relevant to Juniata's business. In addition, economic factors impact customers' needs for financing, thus affecting loan growth. Additionally, changes in the economy can directly impact the credit strength of existing and potential borrowers.\nFOCUS OF MANAGEMENT\nThe management of Juniata believes that it is important to know who and what we are in order to be successful. We must be aligned in our efforts to achieve goals. We've identified the four characteristics that define the Company and the personnel that support it. We are Committed, Capable, Caring and Connected. Management seeks to be the preeminent financial institution in its market area and measures its success by the five key elements described below.\nSHAREHOLDER SATISFACTION\nAbove all else, management is committed to maximizing the value of our shareholders' investment, through both stock value appreciation and dividend returns. Remaining connected to our communities will allow us to identify the financial needs of our market and to deliver those products and services capably. In doing so, we will seek to profitably grow the balance sheet and enhance earnings, while maintaining capital and liquidity levels that exceed all regulatory guidelines.\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nWe are committed to maximizing customer satisfaction. We are sensitive to the expanding array of financial services and financial service providers available to our customers, both locally and globally. We are committed to fostering a complete customer relationship by helping clients identify their current and future financial needs and offering practical and affordable solutions to both. As our customers' lifestyles change, the channels through which we deliver our services must change as well. One element of the Company's strategic plan is to provide connection through every means available, wherever we are needed, whether through a stand-alone branch, in-store boutique, ATM or via online and mobile banking anywhere internet or cell phone signals can be received. In 2019, we continued to make advances in technological resources, placing data and information in the hands of our customers and employees, because we are committed to optimizing the customer experience.\nBALANCE SHEET GROWTH\nWe are capable of profitable balance sheet growth. Rapid growth should not be a substitute for careful fiscal and strategic management. It is our goal to continue quality growth despite intense competition by paying careful attention to the needs of our customers. We will continue to maintain high credit standards, knowing that lending under the right circumstances is the proper way to maintain soundness and profitability. We believe we consistently pay fair market rates on all deposits and have invested wisely and conservatively in compliance with self-imposed standards, minimizing risk of asset impairment. We aspire to increase our market share within the current communities that we serve, and to expand in contiguous areas through acquisition and investment. As part of our strategic plan for growth, we continue to actively seek\nopportunities for acquisitions of branches or stakes in other financial institutions, similar to those that have occurred in prior years, and most recently in April 2018 with the acquisition of LCB.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nWe are capable of producing profitability ratios that exceed those of many of our peers. Recognizing that net interest margins have narrowed for banks in general and that they may not return to the ranges experienced in the past, we also focus on the importance of providing fee-generating services in which customers find value. Offering a broad array of services prevents us from becoming too reliant on one form of revenue. It has also been our philosophy to spend conservatively and to implement operating efficiencies where possible to keep non-interest expense from escalating in areas that can be controlled.\nCONNECTION TO THE COMMUNITY\nWe are active corporate citizens of the communities we serve. Although the world of banking has transitioned to global availability through electronics, we believe that our community banking philosophy is not only still valid, but essential. Despite technological advances, banking is still a personal business, particularly in the rural areas we serve. We believe that our customers shop for services and value a relationship with an institution involved in the same community, with the same interests in its prosperity. We have a foundation and a history in each of the communities we serve. Management takes an active role in local business and industry development organizations to help attract and retain commerce in our market area. We provide businesses, large and small, with financial tools and financing needed to grow and prosper. We have always been committed to responsible lending practices. We invest locally by including local municipal bonds in our investment portfolio and participating in funding for such projects as low income and elderly housing. We support charitable programs that benefit the local communities, not only with monetary contributions, but also through the personal involvement of our caring employees. In 2019, we initiated the JAVA with JVB program offering in-person training and online videos via social media to educate our customers and the communities we serve on various banking and financial related topics.\nJUNIATA'S OPPORTUNITIES\nSOUNDNESS AND STABILITY\nOur financial condition is strong. We enjoy strong capital and liquidity ratios that significantly exceed regulatory guidelines. Our business model includes a plan for growth without sacrificing profitability or integrity. We believe an opportunity exists for banks such as ours to offer the trusted, personal service of a locally managed institution that has roots in the community reaching back over 150 years.\nEXPANSION OF CUSTOMER BASE\nOur strategic focus is based on leveraging our collective knowledge of the Company's primary and contiguous markets to identify lending or fee-based opportunities consistent with our risk parameters and profitability targets. We continue to develop our sales team through mentoring and by making employee education paramount. We continually seek and implement back-room efficiencies. We recognize change is taking place in a world where convenience and mobility are priorities for consumers and businesses when choosing a financial institution with whom to do business. We offer full-featured secure mobile banking that includes remote check deposit for use on home computers and all mobile devices for consumers. For businesses, we provide options for cash management and remote deposit. We offer identity protection to the families of our customers, which we believe to be a true value-added service, with features that go far beyond traditional banking services, and sets us apart from other financial institutions in our market area. With the acquisition of First National Bank of Port Allegheny ( FNBPA\u201d) in 2015, we expanded our market into the northern tier region of Pennsylvania and integrated the JVB brand there and have since expanded our footprint in Perry County, Pennsylvania, through the consummation of the acquisition of LCB in April 2018.\nDELIVERY SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS\nWe seek to continually enhance our customer delivery system, both through technology and physical facilities. We actively seek opportunities to expand our branch network through acquisitions. We believe that it is imperative that our customers have convenient and easy access to personal financial services that complement their particular lifestyle, whether it is through electronic or personal delivery. We achieved an early entry into the mobile banking arena and have since expanded online delivery, including consumer remote deposit and Touch ID. Through the fully redesigned JVBonline.com website,\nwe offer a suite of online services including the convenience of online loan applications for residential mortgages, home equity, vehicle and other personal loans. Online and mobile banking features include full bill-pay and monetary transfers between internal and external accounts. Our ATM network is equipped with state-of-the art machines. Our Customer Care Center provides a dedicated service to address all customer inquiries and provides outreach through our social media sites. Our updated branch facilities feature a highly interactive and complete customer experience. In 2020, Juniata plans to add online deposit account opening capability to our product line.\nJUNIATA'S CHALLENGES\nNET INTEREST MARGIN COMPRESSION\nThe low interest rate environment that has persisted in recent years has pressured the net interest margin for most banks, including Juniata. Loans have been originated, acquired or repriced at lower rates, reducing the average rate earned on those assets. While the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, has also declined, the decline has not always occurred at the same pace as the decline in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, which can result in a narrowing of the net interest margin. We believe that increasing the net interest margin will continue to be a challenge until general market rates rise more significantly.\nCOMPETITION\nEach year, competition becomes more intense and global in nature. To meet this challenge, we attempt to stay in close contact with our customers, monitoring their satisfaction with our services through surveys, personal visits and networking in the communities we serve. We strive to meet or exceed our customers' expectations and deliver consistent high-quality service. We believe that our customers have become acutely aware of the value of local service, and we strive to maintain their confidence.\nRATE ENVIRONMENT\nWe intend to continue making what we believe to be rational pricing decisions for loans, deposits and non-deposit products. This strategy can be difficult to maintain, as many of our peers appear to continue pricing for growth, rather than long-term profitability and stability. We believe that a strategy of growth for the sake of growth\u201d results in lower profitability, and such actions by large groups of banks have had an adverse impact on the entire financial services industry. We intend to maintain our core pricing principles, which we believe protect and preserve our future as a sound community financial services provider, proven by results.\nREGULATIONS\nThe Company is subject to banking regulation, as well as regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) and, as such, must comply with many laws, including the USA Patriot Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Sarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Management has established a Disclosure Committee for Financial Reporting, an internal group at Juniata that seeks to ensure that current and potential investors in the Company receive full and complete information concerning our financial condition. Juniata has incurred direct and indirect costs associated with compliance with the SEC's filing and reporting requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as adherence to new and existing banking regulations and stronger corporate governance requirements. Regulatory burdens continue to increase as evidenced by the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that impact the Company in the areas of corporate governance, capital requirements and restrictions on fees that may be charged to consumers.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared based upon the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), the most significant of which are described in Note 2 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Certain of these policies, particularly with respect to allowance for loan losses and the investment portfolio, require numerous estimates and economic assumptions, based upon information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. As such, over time, they may prove inaccurate or vary and may significantly affect the Company's reported results and financial position in future periods.\nThe accounting policy for establishing the allowance for loan losses relies to a greater extent on the use of estimates than other areas and, as such, has a greater possibility of producing results that could be different from those currently reported. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in the allowance for loan losses could have a material impact on the Company's future financial condition and results of operations. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an evaluation of individual credits in the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2019 and 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\nThe comparability of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was impacted by the following events discussed in more detail below: (i) the termination of The Juniata Valley Bank Retirement Plan ( JVB Plan\u201d) and (ii) the acquisition of LCB. Juniata's management believes it is meaningful to present a performance comparison that segregates the financial impact of the afore-mentioned items, to allow a view of comparative results to 2018. The following discussion includes both GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental tables presented below. The non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted\u201d results.\nIn 2019, Juniata satisfied all obligations of the JVB Plan, recording pre-tax pension settlement charges of $1,221,000 during the year, compared to a pre-tax pension settlement charge of $210,000 recorded in 2018. The pre-tax charges represent the acceleration of pension expenses that would otherwise have impacted Juniata's future earnings.\nPrior to Juniata's acquisition of Liverpool on April 30, 2018, Juniata owned 39.16% of the outstanding common stock of Liverpool and recorded its share of Liverpool's earnings as income from unconsolidated subsidiary\u201d using the equity method of accounting. In conjunction with the acquisition, Juniata incurred $884,000 in merger-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018, while no merger-related expenses were incurred in 2019. An adjustment to the carrying value of Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership of Liverpool at April 30, 2018 resulted in a recorded pre-tax net gain of $215,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, a credit to the income tax provision of $406,000 was recorded in 2018 to remove a deferred tax liability related to Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership in Liverpool upon Juniata's acquisition of Liverpool, while no similar credit was recorded in 2019.\nNet income for Juniata in 2019 was $5,835,000, compared to net income of $5,904,000 for 2018. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis decreased from $1.18 in 2018 to $1.14 in 2019. When adjusted for the impact of the tax-effected events mentioned above, adjusted net income was $6,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 12.9% over adjusted net income of $6,024,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 9.9% from $1.21 in 2018 to $1.33 in 2019. For 2019, return on average assets ( ROA\u201d) and return on average equity ( ROE\u201d) were 0.90% and 8.24%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, return on average assets was 1.05% in 2019 compared to 0.98% in 2018, while return on average equity was 9.61% in both 2019 and 2018.\nThe net interest margin, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, decreased from 3.60% in 2018 to 3.57% in 2019. The yield on earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.31%, while the cost of funds increased 21 basis points, to 1.06%, in 2019 compared to 2018.\nBelow, and on the following page, are the comparative disclosures illustrating the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the previous page to GAAP financial measures for the most recent two years.\nTable 53: <table>

<td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant component of revenue, comprising approximately 81% of total revenues (the total of net interest income and non-interest income, exclusive of security losses) for 2019. Interest spread measures the absolute difference between average rates earned and average rates paid. Because some interest earning assets are tax-exempt, an adjustment is made for analytical purposes to present all assets on a fully tax-equivalent basis. Net interest margin is the percentage of net return on average earning assets, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, and provides a measure of comparability of a financial institution's performance.\nBoth net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by interest rate changes, changes in the relationships between various rates and changes in the composition of the average balance sheet. Additionally, product pricing, product mix and customer preferences dictate the composition of the balance sheet and the resulting net interest income. Table 1 shows average asset and liability balances, average interest rates and interest income and expense for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017.

volume. Average total loans outstanding increased by 6.2%, to $409,362,000, in 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily due to the addition of Liverpool's loan portfolio, as well as organic growth. Average yields on loans increased by 26 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018, which was 23 basis points greater than 2017. As shown in Table 2, Rate - Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income, the increase in yield in 2019 raised interest income on loans by approximately $1,111,000, while the decline in volume decreased interest income by $111,000 compared to 2018, resulting in a net increase in interest recorded on loans of $1,000,000. Contributing 5 basis points to the increase in loan yields in 2019 was the collection of a substantial amount of previously unaccrued interest on a loan charged off in 2012. During 2018, the increase in loan yield increased interest income by approximately $858,000 compared to 2017, while the increase in volume increased interest income by $1,197,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on loans of $2,055,000 in 2018 compared to 2017. The prime rate declined 75 basis points during 2019, ending at 4.75%. During 2018, the prime rate increased by 100 basis points to end the year at 5.50%, which contributed to the increase in the average yield on loans in 2018 compared to 2017.\nDuring 2019, cash flows from maturities, sales and repayments of investment securities were reinvested into the securities portfolio, as were the additional funds from the growth in interest bearing liabilities. As a result, average balances of\ninvestment securities increased by $24,420,000, or 16.1%, during 2019 compared to 2018. This increase in volume accounted for a $610,000 increase in interest income compared to 2018. The 15 basis point improvement in the overall yield of the investment portfolio between 2019 and 2018 increased net interest income by $219,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on investment securities of $829,000 in 2019 compared to 2018.\nDuring 2018, cash flows from maturities, sales and repayments of investment securities were primarily used to fund a portion of the loan growth and pay off maturing long-term debt and pay down short-term borrowings. Additional funds from deposit growth were invested into the loan portfolio and used to pay down debt. As a result, average balances of investment securities decreased by $7,996,000, and this volume decline accounted for a $162,000 decrease in interest income compared to 2017. The improvement in the overall yield of the investment portfolio by 18 basis points between 2017 and 2018 increased net interest income by $256,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on investment securities of $94,000 in 2018 compared to 2017.\nIn total, yield on earning assets in 2019 was 4.31% compared to 4.18% in 2018 and 3.92% in 2017. On a fully tax equivalent basis, the yield on earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.37% in 2019, from 4.25% in 2018, which increased 20 basis points from 4.05% in 2017.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased by $17,755,000, or 4.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018, which increased $5,973,000 compared to 2017. Within the categories of interest bearing liabilities, deposits increased on average by $8,810,000 and average borrowings increased by $8,945,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. During 2018, average deposits increased by $29,683,000, while average borrowings declined by $23,710,000. The addition of Liverpool's deposits was the primary reason for the increase in average interest bearing deposits in 2018 as Liverpool's deposits were used to fund a reduction in overnight borrowings and the repayment of two FHLB long-term debt advances. Changes in the volume and rate of other interest-bearing liabilities, in aggregate, increased interest expense by $435,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, while the aggregate changes in volume and rate in 2018 decreased interest expense by $159,000 compared to 2017. The percentage of average interest earning assets funded by average non-interest bearing demand deposits was approximately 21.4% in 2019, compared to 23.1% in 2018 and 19.8% in 2017. The total cost to fund earning assets (computed by dividing the total interest expense by the total average earning assets) in 2019 was 0.79%, compared to 0.64% in 2018 and 0.52% in 2017. This increase was primarily caused by the flattening of the yield curve coupled with deposit rate competition.\nNet interest income was $20,906,000 for 2019, an increase of $890,000 when compared to 2018. Increases in both volume and rates contributed $456,000 and $434,000, respectively, toward the improved net interest income in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES\nJuniata's provision for loan losses is determined as a result of an analysis of the adequacy level of the allowance for loan losses. In order to closely reflect the potential losses within the current loan portfolio based upon current information known, the Company carries no unallocated allowance. Using the process of analysis described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies\u201d earlier in this discussion, the Company determined that a credit of $573,000 was appropriate for 2019, a decrease of $910,000 when compared to 2018 when the total loan loss provision was $337,000. A credit of $573,000 was recorded to the loan loss provision during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to net recoveries of $500,000 on previously charged off loans. Also contributing to the decline in the provision for loan losses in 2019 was a general improvement in credit quality factors, such as delinquency trends and classified loan balances. The discussion included in the Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses in the section below titled Financial Condition\u201d explains the information and analysis used to arrive at the provision for 2019.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nThe Company remains committed to providing comprehensive services and products to meet the current and future financial needs of its customers. Juniata believes its responsiveness to customers' needs surpasses that of many of its competitors and measures its success by the customer acceptance of fee-based services. The Company continually explores avenues to enhance product offerings in areas beneficial to its customers, such as adding new features and services for its electronic banking clientele. Fraud protection services are made available to all consumer depositors. We offer a variety of options for financing to home-buyers that includes a mortgage referral program, providing significant fee income.\nJuniata also provides alternative investment opportunities through an arrangement with a broker dealer that integrates the delivery of non-traditional products with Juniata's Trust and Wealth Management Division. This arrangement enables Juniata to meet the investment needs of a varied customer base and to better identify its clients' needs for traditional trust services.\nNon-interest income was $4,749,000 in 2019 compared to $5,027,000 in 2018. Most significantly impacting the comparative year-end periods was a decline in income/gain from unconsolidated subsidiary of $296,000, which included a $215,000 gain from the adjustment to the carrying value of Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership in Liverpool prior to its 100% acquisition. The equity method of accounting for the Liverpool investment was discontinued with the acquisition by Juniata of the remaining outstanding Liverpool shares in April 2018. Since then, all income and expense items from the newly acquired Liverpool office have been included as part of Juniata's operations in the appropriate line items in the financial statements.\nFee-generated non-interest revenues consist of customer service fees derived from deposit accounts, trust relationships and sales of non-deposit products. In 2019, revenues from these services totaled $2,383,000, representing a decrease of $85,000, or 3.4%, from 2018 revenues, primarily due to declines in customer service and trust fees. Total fees from customer deposits decreased by $62,000, or 3.5%. Fees from both estate settlements and non-estate fees declined by $28,000 and $8,000, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018. Variance in fees from estate settlements occurs because estate settlements occur sporadically and are not necessarily consistent year to year. Non-estate fees are repeatable revenues that generally increase and decrease in relation to movements in interest rates as market values of trust assets under management increase or decrease and as new relationships are established. Commissions from sales of non-deposit products increased in 2019, in comparison to 2018, by $13,000, or 5.0%, as sales increased.\nFees generated by debit card activity increased by $69,000, or 5.4%, in 2019 compared to the prior year due to general increased debit card usage.\nEarnings on bank-owned life insurance and annuities declined by $63,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 caused by a reporting modification by our split dollar insurance service provider in which the income is no longer separated from the expense as it was in prior years. The split dollar income is now netted against the expense within employee benefits expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Split dollar insurance income of $57,000 was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018, while there was no recorded income in 2019, which caused the majority of the decline in earnings on bank-owned life insurance and annuities in 2019 compared to 2018. The recorded net split dollar expense in 2019 was $30,000 compared to a net expense of $19,000 through the same period in 2018 based upon the gross expense of $76,000 recorded through December 31, 2018.\nOther non-interest-related fees derived from loan activity decreased by $83,000 when comparing 2019 to 2018, partially due to a recovery on a purchased LCB loan recorded in 2018, as well as declines in revenues generated from title insurance fees and the loan referral program.\nLosses realized from the sales and calls of investment securities during 2019 were $43,000 compared to losses of $188,000 in 2018. Strategies were undertaken in both years to replace lower yielding investments with higher yielding ones in order to position the portfolio for higher future returns.\nAs a percentage of average assets, non-interest income (excluding securities gains/losses on sales or calls of securities) was 0.74% and 0.85% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nManagement strives to control non-interest expense where possible in order to improve operating results. Non-interest expense was $20,407,000 in 2019 compared to $19,461,000 in 2018. The increase was driven by Juniata's growth resulting from the Liverpool acquisition; specifically, increases in employee compensation, occupancy, equipment, and data processing; as well as the termination of the JVB Plan.\nEmployee compensation expense increased $435,000, or 5.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018, predominantly due to accounting for a full year of the Liverpool staff in 2019 compared to eight months in 2018. Employee compensation and\nbenefits expense increased by $1,136,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to the recording of $1,221,000 in pre-tax pension settlement charges as a result of settling the remaining obligations associated with the final liquidation of the JVB Plan compared to $210,000 in pre-tax pension settlement charges recorded in 2018. Partially offsetting this increase were declines of $32,000 in medical expense in 2019 compared to 2018, as well as $45,000 in split dollar expense due to a reporting modification by our insurance service provider in 2019, which now nets the split dollar income against the expense as opposed to reporting the income separately as in prior years.\nData processing expense increased by $190,000, or 9.9%, in 2019 compared to 2018, along with an aggregate increase in occupancy and equipment expense of $142,000, or 7.0%, due to the increased expense of a full year of Liverpool's data processing, branch office, and equipment expenses in 2019 compared to eight months in 2018, as well as the completion of two remodeling projects in 2019.\nProfessional fees increased $321,000, or 50.2%, during 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was predominantly due to higher audit expenses related to an increase in fees incurred from the Company's former audit firm during the transition to the newly engaged firm. In addition, a new consulting arrangement to strengthen compliance reviews also added to the increased expense in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPartially offsetting these increases was a decline of $884,000 in merger and acquisition expenses as no similar expense was recorded in 2019, as well as an increase in the gain on sales of other real estate owned of $148,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. FDIC insurance premiums declined by $166,000 due to the application of small bank assessment credits applied in 2019, while none were applied in 2018.\nAs a percentage of average assets, non-interest expense was 3.15% in 2019 as compared to 3.17% in 2018. Excluding defined benefit settlement costs and merger expenses in both periods, non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets was 2.96% in 2019 compared to 3.14% in 2018, an improvement of 18 basis points.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome tax for 2019 amounted to a benefit of $14,000 versus a benefit of $659,000 in 2018. Impacting the income tax provision in 2018 was the removal of a $406,000 deferred tax liability related to the previous investment in unconsolidated subsidiary. Both periods included the effect of a tax credit amounting to $902,000 in 2019 and $901,000 in 2018. The tax credit was available to the Company as a result of an equity investment in two low-income housing projects. Juniata's effective tax rate in 2019 was (0.2)% versus (12.6)% in 2018. See Note 15 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nBALANCE SHEET SUMMARY\nJuniata functions as a financial intermediary and, as such, its financial condition can be best analyzed in terms of changes in its uses and sources of funds and can also be analyzed in terms of changes in daily average balances. The table below sets forth average daily balances for the last three years and the dollar change and percentage change for the past two years.\nTABLE 3\nCHANGES IN USES AND SOURCES OF FUNDS\nTable 66:

The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in long-term debt and interest bearing demand deposits, which were used to fund the purchases of additional taxable securities during the year. The ratio of average earning assets to total average assets was 91.9% in 2019, while it was 92.0% in 2018. The ratio of average interest-bearing liabilities to total average assets decreased in 2019 to 68.5% from 69.2% in 2018. Although Juniata's previous investment in its unconsolidated subsidiary, investment in low income elderly housing projects and its bank owned life insurance and annuities are not classified as interest-earning assets, income is derived directly from those assets. These instruments have represented 3.1% and 3.6% of total average\nassets in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Management believes that diversification in the loan portfolio is important, and management performs a loan concentration analysis on a quarterly basis. The highest loan concentration by activity type was real estate - commercial loans secured by income-producing property, with debt service on this category of loans being reliant upon the cash flow generated by the property. In the aggregate, loans in this category had outstanding balances of $95,305,000 at December 31, 2019, or 131.72% of the Bank's capital.

See Note 7 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2019, there was growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, as well as real estate - construction loans, which was offset by a decline is all other loan categories. The decrease was largely due to a few unanticipated real estate\n- commercial and obligations of states and political subdivision loan payoffs, as well as the competitive lending environment. There was growth in all loan categories in 2018, mainly due to the addition of Liverpool's loan portfolio, as well as organic growth. Juniata is willing, able and continues to lend to qualifying businesses and individuals. Our business model closely aligns lenders and community office managers' efforts to effectively develop referrals and existing customer relationships. Continued emphasis is placed on responsiveness and personal attention given to customers, which we believe differentiates the Bank from its competition. Nearly all commercial loans are either variable or adjustable rate loans, while non-mortgage consumer loans generally have fixed rates for the duration of the loan.\nJuniata strives to offer fair, competitive rates and to provide optimal service in order to attract loan growth. Emphasis will continue to be placed upon attracting the entire customer relationship of our borrowers.\nThe loan portfolio carries the potential risk of past due, non-performing or, ultimately, charged-off loans. The Bank attempts to manage this risk through credit approval standards and aggressive monitoring and collection efforts. Where prudent, the Bank secures commercial loans with collateral consisting of real and/or tangible personal property. The Company maintains a dedicated credit administration division, in response to the need for heightened credit review, both in the loan origination process and in the ongoing risk assessment process. Juniata's lending strategy and credit standards stress quality growth, diversified by product. A standardized credit policy is in place throughout the Company, and the credit committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves all loan requests for amounts that exceed management's approval levels. The Company makes credit judgments based on a customer's existing debt obligations, collateral, ability to pay and general economic trends. See Note 2 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses is determined in order to provide for probable losses on existing loans. A quarterly provision or credit is charged to earnings to maintain the allowance at adequate levels. Charge-offs and recoveries are recorded as adjustments to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was 0.74% of total loans, net of unearned interest compared to 0.73% of total loans, net of unearned interest, at the end of 2018. Loans that Juniata acquired through mergers and acquisitions, such as those acquired from Liverpool in 2018 and FNBPA in 2015 are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Acquired loans subsequently deemed impaired are included in the allowance for loan losses as impaired loans. Through loan amortization and other scheduled payments, the excluded balances become a smaller percentage of total outstanding loans over time, contributing to the increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans. The allowance decreased $73,000 when compared to December 31, 2018, as a result of recording net recoveries of $500,000 and a credit to the loan loss provision of $573,000 compared to net charge-offs of $242,000 in 2018 that were offset by the provision of $337,000. Net recoveries for 2019 were 0.12% compared to net charge-offs of 0.06% in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, non-performing loans (as defined in Table 4 below), as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses, were 74.4% as compared to 68.4% at December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans were 0.55% of loans as of December 31, 2019, and 0.50% of loans as of December 31, 2018. The increase in nonperforming loans in 2019 compared to 2018 was predominantly due to a $112,000 increase in non-accrual loans in 2019. Of the $2,202,000 in non-performing loans at December 31, 2019, only one loan for $14,000 was not collateralized with real estate.\nTABLE 4\nNON-PERFORMING LOANS\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,688\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more, exclusive of loans acquired with credit deterioration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructured loans in default and non-accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,690\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or\nreasonable doubt exists as to the full, timely collection of principal or interest. However, it is the Company's policy to continue to accrue interest on loans over 90 days past due if (1) they are guaranteed or well secured and (2) there is an effective means of timely collection in process. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed against current period income, and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Interest received on non-accrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management's judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, accruals are resumed on loans only when the obligation is brought fully current with respect to interest and principal, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. The Company's non-accrual and charge-off policies are the same, regardless of loan type. During 2019, gross interest income that would have been recorded if loans on non-accrual status had been current was $130,000, of which $88,000 was collected and included in net income.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nThe amount of allowance for loan losses is determined through a critical quantitative and qualitative analysis performed by management that includes significant assumptions and estimates. It is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable estimated losses within the loan portfolio and supported by detailed documentation. To assess potential credit weaknesses, it is important to analyze observable trends that may be occurring.\nManagement systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis to provide for probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The Bank's methodology for maintaining the allowance is highly structured and contains two components: 1) specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated for impairment under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Section 310-10-35; and 2) allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20 (Contingencies).\nComponent for impaired loans:\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nThe estimated fair values of substantially all the Company's impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan's collateral. For commercial loans secured with real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the current appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values may be discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include the estimated costs to sell the property. For commercial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower's financial statements, inventory reports, aging accounts receivable, equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The Company generally does not separately identify individual consumer segment loans for impairment analysis, unless such loans are subject to a restructuring agreement.\nLoans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the Company grants borrower's concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve a below-market interest rate based on the loan's risk characteristics or an extension of a loan's stated maturity date. Non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal\nand interest payments, under the modified terms, are current for a sustained period after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 31 loans, with aggregate outstanding balances of $2,516,000, were evaluated for impairment. A collateral analysis was performed on each of these 31 loans in order to establish a portion of the reserve needed to carry impaired loans at no higher than fair value. As a result of this analysis, no loans were determined to have insufficient collateral, and therefore, no specific reserves were established. Loans acquired with credit impairment are considered to be impaired loans but are not included with this component for consideration in the allowance. They were carried at fair value of $1,070,000 as of December 31, 2019.\nComponent for pooled loan contingencies:\nA contingency is an existing condition, or set of circumstances, involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to the Company that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. These conditions may be considered in relation to individual loans or in relation to groups of similar types of loans. If the conditions are met, a provision is made even though the loans that are uncollectible may not be identifiable.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20, when measuring estimated credit losses, these loans are grouped into homogenous pools with similar characteristics and evaluated collectively considering both quantitative measures, such as historical loss, and qualitative measures, in the form of environmental adjustments.\nThese pools are established by general loan type, or \"class\" as follows:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial, financial and agricultural\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReal estate - commercial\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReal estate - construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReal estate - mortgage\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPersonal\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSome portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on \"class segments,\" which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For commercial, financial and agricultural loans, class segments include commercial loans secured by other-than real estate collateral. Real estate - commercial class segments include loans secured by farmland, multi-family properties, owner-occupied non-farm, non-residential properties and other nonfarm non-residential properties. Real estate - construction loan class segments include loans secured by commercial real estate, loans to commercial borrowers secured by residential real estate and loans to individuals secured by residential real estate. Real estate - mortgage includes loans secured by first and junior liens on residential real estate. Obligations of states and political subdivision loan class segment primarily includes tax-anticipation notes to local municipalities and other tax-exempt organizations. Personal loan class segments include direct consumer installment loans, indirect automobile loans and other revolving and unsecured loans to individuals.\nQuantitative factor determination:\nAn average annual loss rate is calculated for each pool through an analysis of historical losses over a five-year look-back period. Using data for each loan, a loss emergence period is determined within each segmented class pool. The loss emergence period reflects the approximate length of time from the point when a loss is incurred (the loss trigger event) to the point of loss confirmation (the date of eventual charge-off). The loss emergence period is applied to the average annual loss to produce the quantitative factor for each pooled class segment.\nQualitative factor determination:\nHistorical loss rates computed in the quantitative component reflects an estimate of the level of incurred losses in the portfolio based on historical experience. Management considers that the current conditions may deviate from those that prevailed over the historical look-back period. Thus, the quantitative rates are an imperfect estimate, necessitating an evaluation of qualitative considerations, i.e. environmental factors, to incorporate these risks.\nManagement considered qualitative, environmental risk factors including:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNational, regional and local economic and business conditions, and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the experience, ability and depth of lending and credit management and other relevant staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExistence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the quality of the loan review system;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in lending policies and procedures including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEffect of external influences, including competition, legal and regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWithin each loan segment, an analysis was performed over a ten-year look-back period to discover peak historical losses, and with this data, management established ranges of risk from minimal to very high, for each risk factor, to produce a supportable anchor for risk assignment. Based on the framework for risk factor evaluation and range of adjustments established through the anchoring process, a risk assessment and corresponding adjustment was assigned for each portfolio segment as of December 31, 2019. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nThe combination of quantitative and qualitative factors was applied to year-end balances in each pooled segment to establish the overall allowance.\nA summary of activity in the allowance for loan loss for the last five years is shown below. The area most affected by charge-offs in each of the five years presented was real estate - mortgages, which balances accounted for approximately 38% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. The Company recorded net recoveries of $500,000 in 2019. Based on the analysis described above, the provision for loan loss in 2019 was 170% lower than in 2018. With the credit to the provision exceeding net recoveries, the loan loss allowance decreased by 2.4% over the December 31, 2018 allowance. Management's analysis indicated that the loan loss allowance of $2,961,000 at December 31, 2019 was adequate.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance of allowance -

The increase in 2019 was mainly the result of the decline in loan growth along with an increase in interest bearing liabilities, mainly deposits and long-term debt, as these funds were used to purchase investment securities.\nThe investment area is managed according to internally established guidelines and quality standards. Juniata segregates its investment securities portfolio into two classifications: those held to maturity and those available for sale. Juniata classifies all new marketable investment securities as available for sale, and currently holds no securities in the held to maturity or trading classifications. At December 31, 2019, the market value of the entire securities portfolio was greater than amortized cost by $647,000 as compared to December 31, 2018, when the market value was less than amortized cost by $3,357,000. The weighted average life of the investment portfolio was 3.8 years on December 31, 2019 and 4.5 years on December 31, 2018. The weighted average maturity has remained short in order to achieve a desired level of liquidity. Table 5, Maturity Distribution\u201d, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition shows the remaining maturity or earliest possible repricing for investment securities.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of securities and the weighted average yields of such securities by contractual maturities or call dates.

Some annuities are also owned to provide cash streams that match certain post-retirement liabilities. See Note 9 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes how the cash surrender values of these instruments changed annually in each of the last two years.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,972\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBOLI net increase in cash surrender value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBOLI policy acquired through merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAnnuities net increase in cash surrender value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,938\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nBranch Acquisition\nOn September 8, 2006, the Company acquired a branch office in Richfield, PA. Goodwill at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2,046,000. The core deposit intangible of $431,000 was fully amortized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The core deposit intangible was amortized over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but is measured annually for impairment.\nFNBPA Acquisition\nOn November 30, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of FNBPA and, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill related to the FNBPA acquisition was $3,402,000. In addition, a core deposit intangible in the amount of $303,000 was recorded and is being amortized over a ten-year period using a sum of the year's digits basis. Core deposit intangible amortization expense recorded in 2019 was $38,000 and, for the succeeding five years beginning 2020, is estimated to be $33,000, $27,000, $22,000, $16,000, and $10,000 per year, respectively, and $5,000 in total for years after\n2024. Core deposit and other intangible assets, net of amortization, was $113,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $151,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nLCB Acquisition\nOn April 30, 2018, Juniata completed the acquisition of LCB and, as a result, recorded goodwill of $3,691,000 as of December 31, 2018. ASC 805 allows for adjustments to the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities, and the resulting goodwill for a period of up to one year after the merger date for new information that becomes available reflecting circumstances at the merger date. During the first quarter of 2019, Juniata recorded a $92,000 credit adjustment to goodwill relating to the tax treatment of Liverpool's acquired net operating loss, resulting in goodwill of $3,599,000 as of December 31, 2019. In addition, a core deposit intangible of $289,000 was recorded and will be amortized over a ten-year period using a sum of the years' digits basis. Core deposit intangible expense recorded in 2019 was $49,000, and for the succeeding five years beginning 2020, is estimated to be $44,000, $39,000, $33,000, $28,000, and $23,000 per year, respectively, and $38,000 in total for years after 2024. Core deposit intangible, net of amortization, was $205,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $254,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nDue to a strategic shift in focus to a new mortgage product, which is increasing fees derived from loan activity, the Company did not originate and sell residential mortgage loans to the secondary market in 2019 or 2018; however, the Company retained the servicing rights on loans originated and sold in prior years. The mortgage servicing rights are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows on pools of mortgages stratified by rate and maturity date. The computed value is carried as an intangible asset. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights was $180,000 and $200,000, respectively.\nDEFERRED TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset/liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, if applicable. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable. Management established a valuation allowance of $34,000 in 2019 for a capital loss carryforward for which the tax benefit is not likely to be realized. No such valuation allowance was established at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of $589,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, which was carried as a non-interest earning asset.\nIn 2018, the value of the Juniata's deferred tax asset was adjusted due primarily to a defined benefit contribution applied to the prior tax year, along with the removal of a deferred tax liability no longer applicable. The net adjustment resulted in a decrease in tax expense in 2018 of $168,000. The remainder of the difference was due to the various other changes in gross temporary tax differences. See Note 15 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOTHER NON-INTEREST EARNING ASSETS\nThe following table summarizes the components of the non-interest earning asset category, and how the ending balances changed annually over the last two years.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,992\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,959)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,778\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPremises and equipment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(143)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(744)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in low income housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(641)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(700)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther receivables and prepaid expenses, including deferred tax assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,843)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,688)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,324\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,316\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDEPOSITS\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits were $531,937,000, an increase of $10,215,000 as compared to the previous year end.

Core transaction accounts increased by 4.1% in 2019. The largest dollar increase in 2019 compared the previous year was $7,056,000 in non-interest demand accounts, while the largest percentage increase of 13.8% was in money market accounts. In addition to our deposit products, we continue to provide alternatives to our customers through the sale of our wealth management (non-deposit) products.\nThe consumer continues to have a need for transaction accounts, and the Bank is continuing to focus on that need in order to build deposit relationships. Our products are geared toward low-cost convenience and ease for the customer. The Company's strategy is to aggressively seek to grow customer relationships by staying in touch with customers' changing needs and new methods of connectivity, in an effort to increase deposit (and loan) market share. The Bank offers identity protection services as an option for all consumer demand depositors. We believe this product to be a valuable and essential tool necessary to combat the upsurge in fraud and identity theft. This product is a unique benefit to our customers as there are no other banks in our immediate market that offer a similar service.\nThe Bank competes in the marketplace with many sources that offer products that directly compete with traditional banking products. In keeping with our desire to provide our customers with a full array of financial services, we supplement the services traditionally offered by our Trust Department by staffing our community offices with wealth management consultants that are licensed and trained to sell variable and fixed rate annuities, mutual funds, stock brokerage services and long-term care insurance. Although the sale of these products can reduce the Bank's deposit levels, these products offer solutions for our customers that traditional bank products cannot and allow us to more completely service our\ncustomer base. Fee income from the sale of non-deposit products (primarily annuities and mutual funds) was $272,000 and $259,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively, of total non-interest income.\nOTHER INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES\nJuniata funds its needs primarily with local deposits and when necessary, relies on external funding sources for additional funding. External funding sources include credit facilities at correspondent banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Juniata's average balances for all borrowings increased by $8,945,000 in 2019 compared to 2018.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in Borrowings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(931)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,177\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,882)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(89.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,906\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,493\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther interest bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,560\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n42,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n33,136\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPENSION PLAN\nThe Company's noncontributory pension plan, the JVB Plan, covered substantially all its employees employed prior to December 31, 2007. As of January 1, 2008, the JVB Plan was amended to close the plan to new entrants. All active participants as of December 31, 2007 became 100% vested in their accrued benefit and, as long as they remained eligible, continued to accrue benefits until December 31, 2012. The benefits were based on years of service and the employee's compensation. Effective December 31, 2012, the JVB Plan was amended to cease future service accruals after that date (i.e., it was frozen).\nThe JVB Plan was amended in 2016 to provide pension benefits to all former FNBPA employees that were previously participants in the former Retirement Plan for the First National Bank of Port Allegany ( FNB Plan\u201d), as of November 30, 2015, at the same level of benefit provided in the FNB Plan. Effective December 31, 2016, the FNB Plan was merged into the JVB Plan, which was amended to provide the same benefits to the class of participants previously included in the FNB Plan.\nIn 2018, Juniata completed the second step of the strategy to reduce the liability associated with its defined benefit pension plan by making a lump sum payment offer to a small group of terminated vested participants in Juniata's defined benefit plan, which resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings of $210,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nJuniata's Board of Directors resolved to terminate the JVB Plan, effective November 30, 2018. All participants were properly notified. During the second quarter of 2019, JVB Plan participants elected preferences for receiving their vested benefit in the form of either lump sum payments or annuities. Those electing lump sums received payment in the second quarter, resulting in a pre-tax settlement charge of $278,000. In the third quarter of 2019, annuities were purchased to provide vested benefits to all remaining recipients, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $943,000. As of December 31, 2019, all obligations were satisfied, and The JVB Plan was liquidated. Please refer to Note 21 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nTotal stockholders' equity increased by $6,329,000, or 9.4%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The Company was well-capitalized and had the capacity to maintain its traditional dividend level in 2019. The Company's net income exceeded dividends paid by $1,346,000. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCI\u201d) to record the reclassification adjustment for gains on sales of debt securities, as well as the unrecognized net gains and the costs associated with the termination of the Company's defined benefit retirement plan increased equity by $4,898,000. Stock based compensation expense recorded pursuant to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan added $113,000 to stockholders' equity in 2019, while payments for exercised stock options increased shareholders' equity by $400,000. Treasury stock purchases during the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased stockholders' equity by $428,000.\nThe following table summarizes how the components of equity changed annually in the last two years.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n67,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59,387\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,904\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,489)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,411)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon stock issued for acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,463\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon stock issued for stock plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTreasury stock issued for stock plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase of stock, net of re-issuance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(428)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(70)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in unrealized security gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(807)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDefined benefit retirement plan adjustments, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,991\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n73,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n67,378\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage stockholders' equity in 2019 was $70,771,000, an increase of 12.9% from $62,689,000 in 2018, and was 59,938,000 in 2017. At December 31, 2019, Juniata held 42,020 shares of stock in treasury versus 42,201 at December 31, 2018. Return on average equity decreased to 8.24% in 2019 from 9.42% in 2018 partially due to the growth in average equity resulting from the increase in AOCI, as well as lower income in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in net income resulted from higher pension termination expenses in 2019, as well as well as the removal of the deferred tax liability in 2018 related to the Company's previous ownership of Liverpool, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $659,000 in 2018 compared to a net tax benefit of $14,000 in 2019. See the discussion in the 2019 Financial Overview section.\nThe Company periodically repurchases shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. In December of 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 200,000 shares of its common stock through its share repurchase program. The program will remain authorized until all approved shares are repurchased, unless terminated by the Board of Directors. Repurchases have typically been accomplished through open market transactions and have complied with all regulatory restrictions on the timing and amount of such repurchases. Shares repurchased have been added to treasury stock and accounted for at cost. These shares may be reissued for stock option exercises, employee stock purchase plan purchases, restricted stock awards, to fulfill dividend reinvestment program needs and to supply shares needed as consideration in an acquisition. During 2019 and 2018, 21,508 and 3,416 shares, respectively, were repurchased in conjunction with this program. There were also 800 restricted share awards forfeited in 2019. Treasury shares of 22,489 and 5,170 were also redeemed for stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Shares remaining authorized for repurchase in the program were 148,266 as of December 31, 2019.\nJuniata declared dividends of $0.88 per common share in both 2019 and 2018 (See Note 16 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding restrictions on dividends from the Bank to the Company). The dividend payout ratio was 76.93% and 74.71% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The dividend payout ratio in 2019 was greater than 2018 due to lower net income in 2019 compared to 2018. In January 2020, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.22 per share to stockholders of record on February 14, 2020, payable on February 28, 2020.\nJuniata's book value per share at December 31, 2019 was $14.45 as compared to $13.23 at December 31, 2018. Juniata's average equity to assets ratio for 2019 and 2018 was 10.93% and 10.20%, respectively. Refer also to the Capital Risk section in the Asset / Liability management discussion that follows.\nASSET / LIABILITY MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\nManagement believes that optimal performance is achieved by maintaining overall risks at a low level. Therefore, the objective of asset/liability management is to control risk and produce consistent, high quality earnings independent of changing interest rates. The Company has identified five major risk areas discussed below:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLiquidity Risk\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapital Risk\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest Rate Risk\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInvestment Portfolio Risk\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEconomic Risk\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Risk\nThrough liquidity risk management, we seek to maintain our ability to readily meet commitments to fund loans, purchase assets and other securities and repay deposits and other liabilities. Liquidity management also includes the ability to manage unplanned changes in funding sources and recognize and address changes in market conditions that affect the quality of liquid assets. Juniata has developed a methodology for assessing its liquidity risk through an analysis of its primary and total liquidity sources. Juniata relies on three main types of liquidity sources: (1) asset liquidity, (2) liability liquidity and (3) off-balance sheet liquidity.\nAsset liquidity refers to assets that we are quickly able to convert into cash, consisting of cash, federal funds sold and securities. Short-term liquid assets generally consist of federal funds sold and securities maturing over the next twelve months. The quality of our short-term liquidity is very good; as federal funds are unimpaired by market risk and as bonds approach maturity, their value moves closer to par value. Liquid assets tend to reduce earnings when there is not an immediate use for such funds, since normally these assets generate income at a lower rate than loans or other longer-term investments.\nLiability liquidity refers to funding obtained through deposits. The largest challenge associated with liability liquidity is cost. Juniata's ability to attract deposits depends primarily on several factors, including sales effort, competitive interest rates and other conditions that help maintain consumer confidence in the stability of the financial institution. Large certificates of deposit, public funds and brokered deposits are all acceptable means of generating and providing funding. If the cost is favorable or fits the overall cost structure of the Bank, then these sources have many benefits. They are readily available, come in large block size, have investor-defined maturities and are generally low maintenance.\nOff-balance sheet liquidity is closely tied to liability liquidity. Sources of off-balance sheet liquidity include Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and federal funds lines with correspondent banks. These sources provide immediate liquidity to the Bank. They are available to be deployed when a need arises. These instruments also come in large block sizes, have investor-defined maturities and generally require low maintenance.\nAvailable liquidity\u201d encompasses all three sources of liquidity when determining liquidity adequacy. It results from the Bank's access to short-term funding sources for immediate needs and long-term funding sources when the need is determined to be permanent. Management uses both on-balance sheet liquidity and off-balance sheet liquidity to manage its liquidity position. The Company's liquidity strategy seeks to maintain an adequate volume of high-quality liquid instruments to facilitate customer liquidity demands. Management also maintains sufficient capital, which provides access to the liability and off-balance sheet sides of the balance sheet for funding. An active knowledge of debt funding sources is important to liquidity adequacy.\nContingency funding management involves maintaining contingent sources of immediate liquidity. Management believes that it must consider an array of available sources in terms of volume, maturity, cash flows and pricing. To meet demands in the normal course of business or for contingency, secondary sources of funding such as public funds deposits, collateralized loans, sales of investment securities or sales of loan receivables are considered.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain both a primary liquidity ratio and a total liquidity ratio greater than 10% of total assets. The primary liquidity ratio equals liquid assets divided by total assets, where liquid assets equal the sum of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with other banks and available for sale securities. Total\nliquidity is comprised of all components noted in primary liquidity plus securities classified as held-to-maturity, if any. If either of these liquidity ratios falls below 10%, it is the Company's policy to increase liquidity in a timely manner to achieve the required ratio.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain available liquidity greater than 10% of total assets and contingency liquidity greater than 7.5% of total assets.\nJuniata is a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which provides short-term liquidity and a source for long-term borrowings. The Bank uses this vehicle to satisfy temporary funding needs throughout the year. The Company had short-term borrowings of $9,700,000 on December 31, 2019 and $11,600,000 on December 31, 2018.\nThe Bank's maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $183,790,000 at December 31, 2019. In order to borrow additional amounts, the FHLB would require the Bank to purchase additional FHLB Stock. The FHLB is a source of both short-term and long-term funding. The Bank must maintain sufficient qualifying collateral to secure all outstanding advances.\nJuniata needs to have liquid resources available to fulfill contractual obligations that require future cash payments.\nCapital Risk\nThe Company maintains sufficient core capital to protect depositors and shareholders and to take advantage of business opportunities while ensuring that it has resources to absorb the risks inherent in the business. Federal banking regulators have established capital adequacy requirements for banks and bank holding companies based on risk factors, which require more capital backing for assets with higher potential credit risk than assets with lower credit risk.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, officially identified by the Basel Committee as Basel III\u201d. In July 2013, the FRB approved final rules to implement the Basel III capital framework which revises the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. The new minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 and were fully phased in on January 1, 2019.\nAs fully phased in, Basel III requires financial institutions to maintain: (a) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%; (b) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%; (c) a minimum ratio of total (that is, tier 1 plus tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%; and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). However, unless the Bank maintains an additional 2.5% capital conservation buffer\u201d above the percentages stated above in (a) - (c), the Company may be unable to obtain capital distributions from it, which could negatively impact the Company's ability to pay dividends, service debt obligations or repurchase common stock. In addition, such a failure could result in a restriction on the Company's ability to pay certain cash bonuses to executive officers, negatively impacting the Company's ability to retain key personnel.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Bank's current capital levels met the fully phased-in minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer, as prescribed in the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules. See Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Risk\nTable 5, presented below, illustrates the maturity distribution of the Company's interest-sensitive assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019. Earliest re-pricing opportunities for variable and adjustable rate products and scheduled maturities for fixed rate products have been placed in the appropriate column to compute the cumulative sensitivity ratio (ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities). Securities with call features are treated as though the call date is the maturity date. Through one year, the cumulative sensitivity ratio is 0.38, indicating a liability-sensitive balance sheet, when measured on a static basis.\nTABLE 5\nMATURITY DISTRIBUTION\nAs of December 31,

portfolio risk as the amount of appreciation or depreciation the investment portfolio will sustain when interest rates change. The securities portfolio will decline in value when interest rates rise and increase in value when interest rates decline. Securities with long maturities, excessive optionality (as a result of call features) and unusual indexes tend to produce the most market risk during interest rate movements. Rate shocks of minus 100 and plus 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points were applied to the securities portfolio to determine how Tier 1 capital would be affected if the securities portfolio had to be liquidated and all gains and losses were recognized. The test revealed that, as of December 31, 2019, the risk-based capital ratio would remain adequate under these scenarios.\nEconomic Risk\nEconomic risk is the risk that the long-term or underlying value of the Company will change if interest rates change. Economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) represents the change in the value of the balance sheet without regard to business continuity. Rate shocks are applied to all financial assets and liabilities, using parallel and non-parallel rate shifts of 100 to 400 basis points to estimate the change in EVE under the various hypothetical scenarios. As of December 31, 2019, in\na rising rate environment, the modeling results indicate that the Company's liabilities would increase in value slightly more than assets would lose value. A non-parallel 200 basis point increase shock in rates produced an estimated 6.8% increase in EVE, indicating a stable value well within Juniata's policy guidelines.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has numerous off-balance sheet loan obligations that exist in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit and letters of credit. Because many commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect that these commitments will have an adverse effect on its liquidity position.\nExposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nThe Company had outstanding loan origination commitments aggregating $97,037,000 and $72,755,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, the Company had $13,448,000 and $14,468,000 outstanding in unused lines of credit commitments extended to its customers at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Liverpool's consumer lines of credit.\nLetters of credit are instruments issued by the Company that guarantee payment by the Bank to the beneficiary in the event of default by the Company's customer in the non-performance of an obligation or service. Most letters of credit are extended for a one-year period. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The amount of the liability as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 for guarantees under letters of credit issued is not material.\nThe maximum undiscounted exposure related to these guarantees at December 31, 2019 was $2,624,000, and the approximate value of underlying collateral upon liquidation that would be expected to cover this maximum potential exposure was $23,429,000.\nIn 2017, the Company executed renewal agreements for technology outsourcing services through two outside service bureaus. Both agreements provide for termination fees if the Company cancels the services prior to the end of the 7-year commitment period that runs through May 31, 2024. At December 31, 2019, termination fees are estimated to be approximately $1,369,000 and $1,253,000 on the two contracts. The termination fees would decrease by approximately 15% in each succeeding year through 2024. Since the Company does not expect to terminate these services with either vendor prior to the end of the commitment periods, no liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2019.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThe performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation; therefore, the effect of inflation is normally not as significant to the Company as it is to other businesses and industries. During periods of high inflation, the money supply usually increases, and banks normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. A bank's operating expenses may increase during inflationary times as the price of goods and services increase.\nA bank's performance is also affected during recessionary periods. In times of recession, a bank usually experiences a tightening on its earning assets and on its profits. A recession is usually an indicator of higher unemployment rates, which could mean an increase in the number of nonperforming loans because of continued layoffs and other deterioration of consumers' financial condition.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

( Company\u201d or Juniata\u201d) and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Juniata Valley Bank ( Bank\u201d). Juniata is a bank holding company that delivers financial services within its market, primarily central Pennsylvania. The Bank provides retail and commercial banking, trust, estate, and wealth management services through 16 offices in Juniata, Mifflin, Perry, Huntingdon, McKean, Potter and Centre counties. On April 30, 2018, Juniata, which previously owned 39.16%, or 1,214 of the 3,100 outstanding common shares of Liverpool Community Bank ( Liverpool\u201d or LCB\u201d), completed the acquisition of the remainder of Liverpool's outstanding common stock. Under the terms of a merger agreement between the parties, LCB merged with and into the Bank.\nThe overview is intended to provide a context for the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have attempted to identify the most important matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and the short-term and long-term opportunities, challenges and risks (including material trends and uncertainties) which we face. We also discuss the actions we are taking to address these opportunities, challenges and risks. The Overview is not intended as a summary of, or a substitute for review of, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS RELEVANT TO JUNIATA\nAs a financial services organization, Juniata's core business is most influenced by the level of, and movement of, interest rates. Lending and investing are done daily, using funding from deposits and borrowings, resulting in net interest income, the most significant portion of operating results. Through the use of asset/liability management tools, the Company continually evaluates the effects that possible changes in interest rates could have on operating results and balance sheet growth. Using this information, along with analysis of competitive factors, management designs and prices its products and services.\nGeneral economic conditions are relevant to Juniata's business. In addition, economic factors impact customers' needs for financing, thus affecting loan growth. Additionally, changes in the economy can directly impact the credit strength of existing and potential borrowers.\nFOCUS OF MANAGEMENT\nThe management of Juniata believes that it is important to know who and what we are in order to be successful. We must be aligned in our efforts to achieve goals. We've identified the four characteristics that define the Company and the personnel that support it. We are Committed, Capable, Caring and Connected. Management seeks to be the preeminent financial institution in its market area and measures its success by the five key elements described below.\nSHAREHOLDER SATISFACTION\nAbove all else, management is committed to maximizing the value of our shareholders' investment, through both stock value appreciation and dividend returns. Remaining connected to our communities will allow us to identify the financial needs of our market and to deliver those products and services capably. In doing so, we will seek to profitably grow the balance sheet and enhance earnings, while maintaining capital and liquidity levels that exceed all regulatory guidelines.\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nWe are committed to maximizing customer satisfaction. We are sensitive to the expanding array of financial services and financial service providers available to our customers, both locally and globally. We are committed to fostering a complete customer relationship by helping clients identify their current and future financial needs and offering practical and affordable solutions to both. As our customers' lifestyles change, the channels through which we deliver our services must change as well. One element of the Company's strategic plan is to provide connection through every means available, wherever we are needed, whether through a stand-alone branch, in-store boutique, ATM or via online and mobile banking anywhere internet or cell phone signals can be received. In 2019, we continued to make advances in technological resources, placing data and information in the hands of our customers and employees, because we are committed to optimizing the customer experience.\nBALANCE SHEET GROWTH\nWe are capable of profitable balance sheet growth. Rapid growth should not be a substitute for careful fiscal and strategic management. It is our goal to continue quality growth despite intense competition by paying careful attention to the needs of our customers. We will continue to maintain high credit standards, knowing that lending under the right circumstances is the proper way to maintain soundness and profitability. We believe we consistently pay fair market rates on all deposits and have invested wisely and conservatively in compliance with self-imposed standards, minimizing risk of asset impairment. We aspire to increase our market share within the current communities that we serve, and to expand in contiguous areas through acquisition and investment. As part of our strategic plan for growth, we continue to actively seek\nopportunities for acquisitions of branches or stakes in other financial institutions, similar to those that have occurred in prior years, and most recently in April 2018 with the acquisition of LCB.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nWe are capable of producing profitability ratios that exceed those of many of our peers. Recognizing that net interest margins have narrowed for banks in general and that they may not return to the ranges experienced in the past, we also focus on the importance of providing fee-generating services in which customers find value. Offering a broad array of services prevents us from becoming too reliant on one form of revenue. It has also been our philosophy to spend conservatively and to implement operating efficiencies where possible to keep non-interest expense from escalating in areas that can be controlled.\nCONNECTION TO THE COMMUNITY\nWe are active corporate citizens of the communities we serve. Although the world of banking has transitioned to global availability through electronics, we believe that our community banking philosophy is not only still valid, but essential. Despite technological advances, banking is still a personal business, particularly in the rural areas we serve. We believe that our customers shop for services and value a relationship with an institution involved in the same community, with the same interests in its prosperity. We have a foundation and a history in each of the communities we serve. Management takes an active role in local business and industry development organizations to help attract and retain commerce in our market area. We provide businesses, large and small, with financial tools and financing needed to grow and prosper. We have always been committed to responsible lending practices. We invest locally by including local municipal bonds in our investment portfolio and participating in funding for such projects as low income and elderly housing. We support charitable programs that benefit the local communities, not only with monetary contributions, but also through the personal involvement of our caring employees. In 2019, we initiated the JAVA with JVB program offering in-person training and online videos via social media to educate our customers and the communities we serve on various banking and financial related topics.\nJUNIATA'S OPPORTUNITIES\nSOUNDNESS AND STABILITY\nOur financial condition is strong. We enjoy strong capital and liquidity ratios that significantly exceed regulatory guidelines. Our business model includes a plan for growth without sacrificing profitability or integrity. We believe an opportunity exists for banks such as ours to offer the trusted, personal service of a locally managed institution that has roots in the community reaching back over 150 years.\nEXPANSION OF CUSTOMER BASE\nOur strategic focus is based on leveraging our collective knowledge of the Company's primary and contiguous markets to identify lending or fee-based opportunities consistent with our risk parameters and profitability targets. We continue to develop our sales team through mentoring and by making employee education paramount. We continually seek and implement back-room efficiencies. We recognize change is taking place in a world where convenience and mobility are priorities for consumers and businesses when choosing a financial institution with whom to do business. We offer full-featured secure mobile banking that includes remote check deposit for use on home computers and all mobile devices for consumers. For businesses, we provide options for cash management and remote deposit. We offer identity protection to the families of our customers, which we believe to be a true value-added service, with features that go far beyond traditional banking services, and sets us apart from other financial institutions in our market area. With the acquisition of First National Bank of Port Allegheny ( FNBPA\u201d) in 2015, we expanded our market into the northern tier region of Pennsylvania and integrated the JVB brand there and have since expanded our footprint in Perry County, Pennsylvania, through the consummation of the acquisition of LCB in April 2018.\nDELIVERY SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS\nWe seek to continually enhance our customer delivery system, both through technology and physical facilities. We actively seek opportunities to expand our branch network through acquisitions. We believe that it is imperative that our customers have convenient and easy access to personal financial services that complement their particular lifestyle, whether it is through electronic or personal delivery. We achieved an early entry into the mobile banking arena and have since expanded online delivery, including consumer remote deposit and Touch ID. Through the fully redesigned JVBonline.com website,\nwe offer a suite of online services including the convenience of online loan applications for residential mortgages, home equity, vehicle and other personal loans. Online and mobile banking features include full bill-pay and monetary transfers between internal and external accounts. Our ATM network is equipped with state-of-the art machines. Our Customer Care Center provides a dedicated service to address all customer inquiries and provides outreach through our social media sites. Our updated branch facilities feature a highly interactive and complete customer experience. In 2020, Juniata plans to add online deposit account opening capability to our product line.\nJUNIATA'S CHALLENGES\nNET INTEREST MARGIN COMPRESSION\nThe low interest rate environment that has persisted in recent years has pressured the net interest margin for most banks, including Juniata. Loans have been originated, acquired or repriced at lower rates, reducing the average rate earned on those assets. While the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, has also declined, the decline has not always occurred at the same pace as the decline in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, which can result in a narrowing of the net interest margin. We believe that increasing the net interest margin will continue to be a challenge until general market rates rise more significantly.\nCOMPETITION\nEach year, competition becomes more intense and global in nature. To meet this challenge, we attempt to stay in close contact with our customers, monitoring their satisfaction with our services through surveys, personal visits and networking in the communities we serve. We strive to meet or exceed our customers' expectations and deliver consistent high-quality service. We believe that our customers have become acutely aware of the value of local service, and we strive to maintain their confidence.\nRATE ENVIRONMENT\nWe intend to continue making what we believe to be rational pricing decisions for loans, deposits and non-deposit products. This strategy can be difficult to maintain, as many of our peers appear to continue pricing for growth, rather than long-term profitability and stability. We believe that a strategy of growth for the sake of growth\u201d results in lower profitability, and such actions by large groups of banks have had an adverse impact on the entire financial services industry. We intend to maintain our core pricing principles, which we believe protect and preserve our future as a sound community financial services provider, proven by results.\nREGULATIONS\nThe Company is subject to banking regulation, as well as regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) and, as such, must comply with many laws, including the USA Patriot Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Sarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Management has established a Disclosure Committee for Financial Reporting, an internal group at Juniata that seeks to ensure that current and potential investors in the Company receive full and complete information concerning our financial condition. Juniata has incurred direct and indirect costs associated with compliance with the SEC's filing and reporting requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as adherence to new and existing banking regulations and stronger corporate governance requirements. Regulatory burdens continue to increase as evidenced by the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that impact the Company in the areas of corporate governance, capital requirements and restrictions on fees that may be charged to consumers.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared based upon the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), the most significant of which are described in Note 2 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Certain of these policies, particularly with respect to allowance for loan losses and the investment portfolio, require numerous estimates and economic assumptions, based upon information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. As such, over time, they may prove inaccurate or vary and may significantly affect the Company's reported results and financial position in future periods.\nThe accounting policy for establishing the allowance for loan losses relies to a greater extent on the use of estimates than other areas and, as such, has a greater possibility of producing results that could be different from those currently reported. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in the allowance for loan losses could have a material impact on the Company's future financial condition and results of operations. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an evaluation of individual credits in the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2019 and 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\nThe comparability of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was impacted by the following events discussed in more detail below: (i) the termination of The Juniata Valley Bank Retirement Plan ( JVB Plan\u201d) and (ii) the acquisition of LCB. Juniata's management believes it is meaningful to present a performance comparison that segregates the financial impact of the afore-mentioned items, to allow a view of comparative results to 2018. The following discussion includes both GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental tables presented below. The non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted\u201d results.\nIn 2019, Juniata satisfied all obligations of the JVB Plan, recording pre-tax pension settlement charges of $1,221,000 during the year, compared to a pre-tax pension settlement charge of $210,000 recorded in 2018. The pre-tax charges represent the acceleration of pension expenses that would otherwise have impacted Juniata's future earnings.\nPrior to Juniata's acquisition of Liverpool on April 30, 2018, Juniata owned 39.16% of the outstanding common stock of Liverpool and recorded its share of Liverpool's earnings as income from unconsolidated subsidiary\u201d using the equity method of accounting. In conjunction with the acquisition, Juniata incurred $884,000 in merger-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018, while no merger-related expenses were incurred in 2019. An adjustment to the carrying value of Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership of Liverpool at April 30, 2018 resulted in a recorded pre-tax net gain of $215,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, a credit to the income tax provision of $406,000 was recorded in 2018 to remove a deferred tax liability related to Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership in Liverpool upon Juniata's acquisition of Liverpool, while no similar credit was recorded in 2019.\nNet income for Juniata in 2019 was $5,835,000, compared to net income of $5,904,000 for 2018. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis decreased from $1.18 in 2018 to $1.14 in 2019. When adjusted for the impact of the tax-effected events mentioned above, adjusted net income was $6,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 12.9% over adjusted net income of $6,024,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 9.9% from $1.21 in 2018 to $1.33 in 2019. For 2019, return on average assets ( ROA\u201d) and return on average equity ( ROE\u201d) were 0.90% and 8.24%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, return on average assets was 1.05% in 2019 compared to 0.98% in 2018, while return on average equity was 9.61% in both 2019 and 2018.\nThe net interest margin, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, decreased from 3.60% in 2018 to 3.57% in 2019. The yield on earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.31%, while the cost of funds increased 21 basis points, to 1.06%, in 2019 compared to 2018.\nBelow, and on the following page, are the comparative disclosures illustrating the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the previous page to GAAP financial measures for the most recent two years.\nTable 53: <table>

Net interest income is the most significant component of revenue, comprising approximately 81% of total revenues (the total of net interest income and non-interest income, exclusive of security losses) for 2019. Interest spread measures the absolute difference between average rates earned and average rates paid. Because some interest earning assets are tax-exempt, an adjustment is made for analytical purposes to present all assets on a fully tax-equivalent basis. Net interest margin is the percentage of net return on average earning assets, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, and provides a measure of comparability of a financial institution's performance.\nBoth net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by interest rate changes, changes in the relationships between various rates and changes in the composition of the average balance sheet. Additionally, product pricing, product mix and customer preferences dictate the composition of the balance sheet and the resulting net interest income. Table 1 shows average asset and liability balances, average interest rates and interest income and expense for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017. Table 2 further shows changes attributable to the volume and rate components of net interest income.\nTABLE 1\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET INTEREST INCOME ANALYSIS\nTable 56: <table> <tr>

Non-accruing loans are included in the above table until they are charged off. \n (6) The change in interest due to rate and volume has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. \n (7) Includes net unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale: ($486) in 2019, ($4,687) in 2018 and ($1,065) in 2017. \n (8) Interest income includes loan fees of $70, $95 and $89 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nOn average, total loans outstanding declined $1,042,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 due to less loan volume. Average total loans outstanding increased by 6.2%, to $409,362,000, in 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily due to the addition of Liverpool's loan portfolio, as well as organic growth. Average yields on loans increased by 26 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018, which was 23 basis points greater than 2017. As shown in Table 2, Rate - Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income, the increase in yield in 2019 raised interest income on loans by approximately $1,111,000, while the decline in volume decreased interest income by $111,000 compared to 2018, resulting in a net increase in interest recorded on loans of $1,000,000. Contributing 5 basis points to the increase in loan yields in 2019 was the collection of a substantial amount of previously unaccrued interest on a loan charged off in 2012. During 2018, the increase in loan yield increased interest income by approximately $858,000 compared to 2017, while the increase in volume increased interest income by $1,197,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on loans of $2,055,000 in 2018 compared to 2017. The prime rate declined 75 basis points during 2019, ending at 4.75%. During 2018, the prime rate increased by 100 basis points to end the year at 5.50%, which contributed to the increase in the average yield on loans in 2018 compared to 2017.\nDuring 2019, cash flows from maturities, sales and repayments of investment securities were reinvested into the securities portfolio, as were the additional funds from the growth in interest bearing liabilities. As a result, average balances of\ninvestment securities increased by $24,420,000, or 16.1%, during 2019 compared to 2018. This increase in volume accounted for a $610,000 increase in interest income compared to 2018. The 15 basis point improvement in the overall yield of the investment portfolio between 2019 and 2018 increased net interest income by $219,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on investment securities of $829,000 in 2019 compared to 2018.\nDuring 2018, cash flows from maturities, sales and repayments of investment securities were primarily used to fund a portion of the loan growth and pay off maturing long-term debt and pay down short-term borrowings. Additional funds from deposit growth were invested into the loan portfolio and used to pay down debt. As a result, average balances of investment securities decreased by $7,996,000, and this volume decline accounted for a $162,000 decrease in interest income compared to 2017. The improvement in the overall yield of the investment portfolio by 18 basis points between 2017 and 2018 increased net interest income by $256,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on investment securities of $94,000 in 2018 compared to 2017.\nIn total, yield on earning assets in 2019 was 4.31% compared to 4.18% in 2018 and 3.92% in 2017. On a fully tax equivalent basis, the yield on earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.37% in 2019, from 4.25% in 2018, which increased 20 basis points from 4.05% in 2017.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased by $17,755,000, or 4.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018, which increased $5,973,000 compared to 2017. Within the categories of interest bearing liabilities, deposits increased on average by $8,810,000 and average borrowings increased by $8,945,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. During 2018, average deposits increased by $29,683,000, while average borrowings declined by $23,710,000. The addition of Liverpool's deposits was the primary reason for the increase in average interest bearing deposits in 2018 as Liverpool's deposits were used to fund a reduction in overnight borrowings and the repayment of two FHLB long-term debt advances. Changes in the volume and rate of other interest-bearing liabilities, in aggregate, increased interest expense by $435,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, while the aggregate changes in volume and rate in 2018 decreased interest expense by $159,000 compared to 2017. The percentage of average interest earning assets funded by average non-interest bearing demand deposits was approximately 21.4% in 2019, compared to 23.1% in 2018 and 19.8% in 2017. The total cost to fund earning assets (computed by dividing the total interest expense by the total average earning assets) in 2019 was 0.79%, compared to 0.64% in 2018 and 0.52% in 2017. This increase was primarily caused by the flattening of the yield curve coupled with deposit rate competition.\nNet interest income was $20,906,000 for 2019, an increase of $890,000 when compared to 2018. Increases in both volume and rates contributed $456,000 and $434,000, respectively, toward the improved net interest income in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES\nJuniata's provision for loan losses is determined as a result of an analysis of the adequacy level of the allowance for loan losses. In order to closely reflect the potential losses within the current loan portfolio based upon current information known, the Company carries no unallocated allowance. Using the process of analysis described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies\u201d earlier in this discussion, the Company determined that a credit of $573,000 was appropriate for 2019, a decrease of $910,000 when compared to 2018 when the total loan loss provision was $337,000. A credit of $573,000 was recorded to the loan loss provision during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to net recoveries of $500,000 on previously charged off loans. Also contributing to the decline in the provision for loan losses in 2019 was a general improvement in credit quality factors, such as delinquency trends and classified loan balances. The discussion included in the Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses in the section below titled Financial Condition\u201d explains the information and analysis used to arrive at the provision for 2019.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nThe Company remains committed to providing comprehensive services and products to meet the current and future financial needs of its customers. Juniata believes its responsiveness to customers' needs surpasses that of many of its competitors and measures its success by the customer acceptance of fee-based services. The Company continually explores avenues to enhance product offerings in areas beneficial to its customers, such as adding new features and services for its electronic banking clientele. Fraud protection services are made available to all consumer depositors. We offer a variety of options for financing to home-buyers that includes a mortgage referral program, providing significant fee income.\nJuniata also provides alternative investment opportunities through an arrangement with a broker dealer that integrates the delivery of non-traditional products with Juniata's Trust and Wealth Management Division. This arrangement enables Juniata to meet the investment needs of a varied customer base and to better identify its clients' needs for traditional trust services.\nNon-interest income was $4,749,000 in 2019 compared to $5,027,000 in 2018. Most significantly impacting the comparative year-end periods was a decline in income/gain from unconsolidated subsidiary of $296,000, which included a $215,000 gain from the adjustment to the carrying value of Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership in Liverpool prior to its 100% acquisition. The equity method of accounting for the Liverpool investment was discontinued with the acquisition by Juniata of the remaining outstanding Liverpool shares in April 2018. Since then, all income and expense items from the newly acquired Liverpool office have been included as part of Juniata's operations in the appropriate line items in the financial statements.\nFee-generated non-interest revenues consist of customer service fees derived from deposit accounts, trust relationships and sales of non-deposit products. In 2019, revenues from these services totaled $2,383,000, representing a decrease of $85,000, or 3.4%, from 2018 revenues, primarily due to declines in customer service and trust fees. Total fees from customer deposits decreased by $62,000, or 3.5%. Fees from both estate settlements and non-estate fees declined by $28,000 and $8,000, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018. Variance in fees from estate settlements occurs because estate settlements occur sporadically and are not necessarily consistent year to year. Non-estate fees are repeatable revenues that generally increase and decrease in relation to movements in interest rates as market values of trust assets under management increase or decrease and as new relationships are established. Commissions from sales of non-deposit products increased in 2019, in comparison to 2018, by $13,000, or 5.0%, as sales increased.\nFees generated by debit card activity increased by $69,000, or 5.4%, in 2019 compared to the prior year due to general increased debit card usage.\nEarnings on bank-owned life insurance and annuities declined by $63,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 caused by a reporting modification by our split dollar insurance service provider in which the income is no longer separated from the expense as it was in prior years. The split dollar income is now netted against the expense within employee benefits expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Split dollar insurance income of $57,000 was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018, while there was no recorded income in 2019, which caused the majority of the decline in earnings on bank-owned life insurance and annuities in 2019 compared to 2018. The recorded net split dollar expense in 2019 was $30,000 compared to a net expense of $19,000 through the same period in 2018 based upon the gross expense of $76,000 recorded through December 31, 2018.\nOther non-interest-related fees derived from loan activity decreased by $83,000 when comparing 2019 to 2018, partially due to a recovery on a purchased LCB loan recorded in 2018, as well as declines in revenues generated from title insurance fees and the loan referral program.\nLosses realized from the sales and calls of investment securities during 2019 were $43,000 compared to losses of $188,000 in 2018. Strategies were undertaken in both years to replace lower yielding investments with higher yielding ones in order to position the portfolio for higher future returns.\nAs a percentage of average assets, non-interest income (excluding securities gains/losses on sales or calls of securities) was 0.74% and 0.85% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nManagement strives to control non-interest expense where possible in order to improve operating results. Non-interest expense was $20,407,000 in 2019 compared to $19,461,000 in 2018. The increase was driven by Juniata's growth resulting from the Liverpool acquisition; specifically, increases in employee compensation, occupancy, equipment, and data processing; as well as the termination of the JVB Plan.\nEmployee compensation expense increased $435,000, or 5.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018, predominantly due to accounting for a full year of the Liverpool staff in 2019 compared to eight months in 2018. Employee compensation and\nbenefits expense increased by $1,136,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to the recording of $1,221,000 in pre-tax pension settlement charges as a result of settling the remaining obligations associated with the final liquidation of the JVB Plan compared to $210,000 in pre-tax pension settlement charges recorded in 2018. Partially offsetting this increase were declines of $32,000 in medical expense in 2019 compared to 2018, as well as $45,000 in split dollar expense due to a reporting modification by our insurance service provider in 2019, which now nets the split dollar income against the expense as opposed to reporting the income separately as in prior years.\nData processing expense increased by $190,000, or 9.9%, in 2019 compared to 2018, along with an aggregate increase in occupancy and equipment expense of $142,000, or 7.0%, due to the increased expense of a full year of Liverpool's data processing, branch office, and equipment expenses in 2019 compared to eight months in 2018, as well as the completion of two remodeling projects in 2019.\nProfessional fees increased $321,000, or 50.2%, during 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was predominantly due to higher audit expenses related to an increase in fees incurred from the Company's former audit firm during the transition to the newly engaged firm. In addition, a new consulting arrangement to strengthen compliance reviews also added to the increased expense in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPartially offsetting these increases was a decline of $884,000 in merger and acquisition expenses as no similar expense was recorded in 2019, as well as an increase in the gain on sales of other real estate owned of $148,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. FDIC insurance premiums declined by $166,000 due to the application of small bank assessment credits applied in 2019, while none were applied in 2018.\nAs a percentage of average assets, non-interest expense was 3.15% in 2019 as compared to 3.17% in 2018. Excluding defined benefit settlement costs and merger expenses in both periods, non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets was 2.96% in 2019 compared to 3.14% in 2018, an improvement of 18 basis points.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome tax for 2019 amounted to a benefit of $14,000 versus a benefit of $659,000 in 2018. Impacting the income tax provision in 2018 was the removal of a $406,000 deferred tax liability related to the previous investment in unconsolidated subsidiary. Both periods included the effect of a tax credit amounting to $902,000 in 2019 and $901,000 in 2018. The tax credit was available to the Company as a result of an equity investment in two low-income housing projects. Juniata's effective tax rate in 2019 was (0.2)% versus (12.6)% in 2018. See Note 15 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nBALANCE SHEET SUMMARY\nJuniata functions as a financial intermediary and, as such, its financial condition can be best analyzed in terms of changes in its uses and sources of funds and can also be analyzed in terms of changes in daily average balances.

The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in long-term debt and interest bearing demand deposits, which were used to fund the purchases of additional taxable securities during the year. The ratio of average earning assets to total average assets was 91.9% in 2019, while it was 92.0% in 2018. The ratio of average interest-bearing liabilities to total average assets decreased in 2019 to 68.5% from 69.2% in 2018. Although Juniata's previous investment in its unconsolidated subsidiary, investment in low income elderly housing projects and its bank owned life insurance and annuities are not classified as interest-earning assets, income is derived directly from those assets. These instruments have represented 3.1% and 3.6% of total average\nassets in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Management believes that diversification in the loan portfolio is important, and management performs a loan concentration analysis on a quarterly basis. The highest loan concentration by activity type was real estate - commercial loans secured by income-producing property, with debt service on this category of loans being reliant upon the cash flow generated by the property. In the aggregate, loans in this category had outstanding balances of $95,305,000 at December 31, 2019, or 131.72% of the Bank's capital.

See Note 7 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2019, there was growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, as well as real estate - construction loans, which was offset by a decline is all other loan categories. The decrease was largely due to a few unanticipated real estate\n- commercial and obligations of states and political subdivision loan payoffs, as well as the competitive lending environment. There was growth in all loan categories in 2018, mainly due to the addition of Liverpool's loan portfolio, as well as organic growth. Juniata is willing, able and continues to lend to qualifying businesses and individuals. Our business model closely aligns lenders and community office managers' efforts to effectively develop referrals and existing customer relationships. Continued emphasis is placed on responsiveness and personal attention given to customers, which we believe differentiates the Bank from its competition. Nearly all commercial loans are either variable or adjustable rate loans, while non-mortgage consumer loans generally have fixed rates for the duration of the loan.\nJuniata strives to offer fair, competitive rates and to provide optimal service in order to attract loan growth. Emphasis will continue to be placed upon attracting the entire customer relationship of our borrowers.\nThe loan portfolio carries the potential risk of past due, non-performing or, ultimately, charged-off loans. The Bank attempts to manage this risk through credit approval standards and aggressive monitoring and collection efforts. Where prudent, the Bank secures commercial loans with collateral consisting of real and/or tangible personal property. The Company maintains a dedicated credit administration division, in response to the need for heightened credit review, both in the loan origination process and in the ongoing risk assessment process. Juniata's lending strategy and credit standards stress quality growth, diversified by product. A standardized credit policy is in place throughout the Company, and the credit committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves all loan requests for amounts that exceed management's approval levels. The Company makes credit judgments based on a customer's existing debt obligations, collateral, ability to pay and general economic trends. See Note 2 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses is determined in order to provide for probable losses on existing loans. A quarterly provision or credit is charged to earnings to maintain the allowance at adequate levels. Charge-offs and recoveries are recorded as adjustments to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was 0.74% of total loans, net of unearned interest compared to 0.73% of total loans, net of unearned interest, at the end of 2018. Loans that Juniata acquired through mergers and acquisitions, such as those acquired from Liverpool in 2018 and FNBPA in 2015 are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Acquired loans subsequently deemed impaired are included in the allowance for loan losses as impaired loans. Through loan amortization and other scheduled payments, the excluded balances become a smaller percentage of total outstanding loans over time, contributing to the increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans. The allowance decreased $73,000 when compared to December 31, 2018, as a result of recording net recoveries of $500,000 and a credit to the loan loss provision of $573,000 compared to net charge-offs of $242,000 in 2018 that were offset by the provision of $337,000. Net recoveries for 2019 were 0.12% compared to net charge-offs of 0.06% in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, non-performing loans (as defined in Table 4 below), as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses, were 74.4% as compared to 68.4% at December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans were 0.55% of loans as of December 31, 2019, and 0.50% of loans as of December 31, 2018. The increase in nonperforming loans in 2019 compared to 2018 was predominantly due to a $112,000 increase in non-accrual loans in 2019. Of the $2,202,000 in non-performing loans at December 31, 2019, only one loan for $14,000 was not collateralized with real estate.\nTABLE 4\nNON-PERFORMING LOANS\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-performing loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-accrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,688\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more, exclusive of loans acquired with credit deterioration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructured loans in default and non-accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,690\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or\nreasonable doubt exists as to the full, timely collection of principal or interest. However, it is the Company's policy to continue to accrue interest on loans over 90 days past due if (1) they are guaranteed or well secured and (2) there is an effective means of timely collection in process. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed against current period income, and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Interest received on non-accrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management's judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, accruals are resumed on loans only when the obligation is brought fully current with respect to interest and principal, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. The Company's non-accrual and charge-off policies are the same, regardless of loan type. During 2019, gross interest income that would have been recorded if loans on non-accrual status had been current was $130,000, of which $88,000 was collected and included in net income.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nThe amount of allowance for loan losses is determined through a critical quantitative and qualitative analysis performed by management that includes significant assumptions and estimates. It is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable estimated losses within the loan portfolio and supported by detailed documentation. To assess potential credit weaknesses, it is important to analyze observable trends that may be occurring.\nManagement systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis to provide for probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The Bank's methodology for maintaining the allowance is highly structured and contains two components: 1) specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated for impairment under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Section 310-10-35; and 2) allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20 (Contingencies).\nComponent for impaired loans:\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nThe estimated fair values of substantially all the Company's impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan's collateral. For commercial loans secured with real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the current appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values may be discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include the estimated costs to sell the property. For commercial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower's financial statements, inventory reports, aging accounts receivable, equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The Company generally does not separately identify individual consumer segment loans for impairment analysis, unless such loans are subject to a restructuring agreement.\nLoans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the Company grants borrower's concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve a below-market interest rate based on the loan's risk characteristics or an extension of a loan's stated maturity date. Non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal\nand interest payments, under the modified terms, are current for a sustained period after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 31 loans, with aggregate outstanding balances of $2,516,000, were evaluated for impairment. A collateral analysis was performed on each of these 31 loans in order to establish a portion of the reserve needed to carry impaired loans at no higher than fair value. As a result of this analysis, no loans were determined to have insufficient collateral, and therefore, no specific reserves were established. Loans acquired with credit impairment are considered to be impaired loans but are not included with this component for consideration in the allowance. They were carried at fair value of $1,070,000 as of December 31, 2019.\nComponent for pooled loan contingencies:\nA contingency is an existing condition, or set of circumstances, involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to the Company that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. These conditions may be considered in relation to individual loans or in relation to groups of similar types of loans. If the conditions are met, a provision is made even though the loans that are uncollectible may not be identifiable.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20, when measuring estimated credit losses, these loans are grouped into homogenous pools with similar characteristics and evaluated collectively considering both quantitative measures, such as historical loss, and qualitative measures, in the form of environmental adjustments.\nThese pools are established by general loan type, or \"class\" as follows:\n \u00b7 Commercial, financial and agricultural \n \u00b7 Real estate - commercial \n \u00b7 Real estate - construction \n \u00b7 Real estate - mortgage \n \u00b7 Obligations of states and political subdivisions \n \u00b7 Personal \nSome portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on \"class segments,\" which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For commercial, financial and agricultural loans, class segments include commercial loans secured by other-than real estate collateral. Real estate - commercial class segments include loans secured by farmland, multi-family properties, owner-occupied non-farm, non-residential properties and other nonfarm non-residential properties. Real estate - construction loan class segments include loans secured by commercial real estate, loans to commercial borrowers secured by residential real estate and loans to individuals secured by residential real estate. Real estate - mortgage includes loans secured by first and junior liens on residential real estate. Obligations of states and political subdivision loan class segment primarily includes tax-anticipation notes to local municipalities and other tax-exempt organizations. Personal loan class segments include direct consumer installment loans, indirect automobile loans and other revolving and unsecured loans to individuals.\nQuantitative factor determination:\nAn average annual loss rate is calculated for each pool through an analysis of historical losses over a five-year look-back period. Using data for each loan, a loss emergence period is determined within each segmented class pool. The loss emergence period reflects the approximate length of time from the point when a loss is incurred (the loss trigger event) to the point of loss confirmation (the date of eventual charge-off). The loss emergence period is applied to the average annual loss to produce the quantitative factor for each pooled class segment.\nQualitative factor determination:\nHistorical loss rates computed in the quantitative component reflects an estimate of the level of incurred losses in the portfolio based on historical experience. Management considers that the current conditions may deviate from those that prevailed over the historical look-back period. Thus, the quantitative rates are an imperfect estimate, necessitating an evaluation of qualitative considerations, i.e. environmental factors, to incorporate these risks.\nManagement considered qualitative, environmental risk factors including:\n \u00b7 National, regional and local economic and business conditions, and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; \n \u00b7 Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans; \n \u00b7 Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; \n \u00b7 Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending and credit management and other relevant staff; \n \u00b7 Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; \n \u00b7 Changes in the quality of the loan review system; \n \u00b7 Changes in lending policies and procedures including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices; \n \u00b7 Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; and \n \u00b7 Effect of external influences, including competition, legal and regulatory requirements. \nWithin each loan segment, an analysis was performed over a ten-year look-back period to discover peak historical losses, and with this data, management established ranges of risk from minimal to very high, for each risk factor, to produce a supportable anchor for risk assignment. Based on the framework for risk factor evaluation and range of adjustments established through the anchoring process, a risk assessment and corresponding adjustment was assigned for each portfolio segment as of December 31, 2019. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nThe combination of quantitative and qualitative factors was applied to year-end balances in each pooled segment to establish the overall allowance.\nA summary of activity in the allowance for loan loss for the last five years is shown below. The area most affected by charge-offs in each of the five years presented was real estate - mortgages, which balances accounted for approximately 38% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. The Company recorded net recoveries of $500,000 in 2019. Based on the analysis described above, the provision for loan loss in 2019 was 170% lower than in 2018. With the credit to the provision exceeding net recoveries, the loan loss allowance decreased by 2.4% over the December 31, 2018 allowance. Management's analysis indicated that the loan loss allowance of $2,961,000 at December 31, 2019 was adequate.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance of allowance -

The increase in 2019 was mainly the result of the decline in loan growth along with an increase in interest bearing liabilities, mainly deposits and long-term debt, as these funds were used to purchase investment securities.\nThe investment area is managed according to internally established guidelines and quality standards. Juniata segregates its investment securities portfolio into two classifications: those held to maturity and those available for sale. Juniata classifies all new marketable investment securities as available for sale, and currently holds no securities in the held to maturity or trading classifications. At December 31, 2019, the market value of the entire securities portfolio was greater than amortized cost by $647,000 as compared to December 31, 2018, when the market value was less than amortized cost by $3,357,000. The weighted average life of the investment portfolio was 3.8 years on December 31, 2019 and 4.5 years on December 31, 2018. The weighted average maturity has remained short in order to achieve a desired level of liquidity. Table 5, Maturity Distribution\u201d, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition shows the remaining maturity or earliest possible repricing for investment securities.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of securities and the weighted average yields of such securities by contractual maturities or call dates.

Some annuities are also owned to provide cash streams that match certain post-retirement liabilities. See Note 9 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes how the cash surrender values of these instruments changed annually in each of the last two years.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,972\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBOLI net increase in cash surrender value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBOLI policy acquired through merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAnnuities net increase in cash surrender value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,938\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nBranch Acquisition\nOn September 8, 2006, the Company acquired a branch office in Richfield, PA. Goodwill at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2,046,000. The core deposit intangible of $431,000 was fully amortized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The core deposit intangible was amortized over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but is measured annually for impairment.\nFNBPA Acquisition\nOn November 30, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of FNBPA and, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill related to the FNBPA acquisition was $3,402,000. In addition, a core deposit intangible in the amount of $303,000 was recorded and is being amortized over a ten-year period using a sum of the year's digits basis. Core deposit intangible amortization expense recorded in 2019 was $38,000 and, for the succeeding five years beginning 2020, is estimated to be $33,000, $27,000, $22,000, $16,000, and $10,000 per year, respectively, and $5,000 in total for years after\n2024. Core deposit and other intangible assets, net of amortization, was $113,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $151,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nLCB Acquisition\nOn April 30, 2018, Juniata completed the acquisition of LCB and, as a result, recorded goodwill of $3,691,000 as of December 31, 2018. ASC 805 allows for adjustments to the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities, and the resulting goodwill for a period of up to one year after the merger date for new information that becomes available reflecting circumstances at the merger date. During the first quarter of 2019, Juniata recorded a $92,000 credit adjustment to goodwill relating to the tax treatment of Liverpool's acquired net operating loss, resulting in goodwill of $3,599,000 as of December 31, 2019. In addition, a core deposit intangible of $289,000 was recorded and will be amortized over a ten-year period using a sum of the years' digits basis. Core deposit intangible expense recorded in 2019 was $49,000, and for the succeeding five years beginning 2020, is estimated to be $44,000, $39,000, $33,000, $28,000, and $23,000 per year, respectively, and $38,000 in total for years after 2024. Core deposit intangible, net of amortization, was $205,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $254,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nDue to a strategic shift in focus to a new mortgage product, which is increasing fees derived from loan activity, the Company did not originate and sell residential mortgage loans to the secondary market in 2019 or 2018; however, the Company retained the servicing rights on loans originated and sold in prior years. The mortgage servicing rights are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows on pools of mortgages stratified by rate and maturity date. The computed value is carried as an intangible asset. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights was $180,000 and $200,000, respectively.\nDEFERRED TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset/liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, if applicable. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable. Management established a valuation allowance of $34,000 in 2019 for a capital loss carryforward for which the tax benefit is not likely to be realized. No such valuation allowance was established at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of $589,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, which was carried as a non-interest earning asset.\nIn 2018, the value of the Juniata's deferred tax asset was adjusted due primarily to a defined benefit contribution applied to the prior tax year, along with the removal of a deferred tax liability no longer applicable. The net adjustment resulted in a decrease in tax expense in 2018 of $168,000. The remainder of the difference was due to the various other changes in gross temporary tax differences. See Note 15 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOTHER NON-INTEREST EARNING ASSETS\nThe following table summarizes the components of the non-interest earning asset category, and how the ending balances changed annually over the last two years.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,992\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,959)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,778\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPremises and equipment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(143)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(744)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment in low income housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(641)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(700)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther receivables and prepaid expenses, including deferred tax assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,843)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,688)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,324\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,316\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDEPOSITS\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits were $531,937,000, an increase of $10,215,000 as compared to the previous year end.

Core transaction accounts increased by 4.1% in 2019. The largest dollar increase in 2019 compared the previous year was $7,056,000 in non-interest demand accounts, while the largest percentage increase of 13.8% was in money market accounts. In addition to our deposit products, we continue to provide alternatives to our customers through the sale of our wealth management (non-deposit) products.\nThe consumer continues to have a need for transaction accounts, and the Bank is continuing to focus on that need in order to build deposit relationships. Our products are geared toward low-cost convenience and ease for the customer. The Company's strategy is to aggressively seek to grow customer relationships by staying in touch with customers' changing needs and new methods of connectivity, in an effort to increase deposit (and loan) market share. The Bank offers identity protection services as an option for all consumer demand depositors. We believe this product to be a valuable and essential tool necessary to combat the upsurge in fraud and identity theft. This product is a unique benefit to our customers as there are no other banks in our immediate market that offer a similar service.\nThe Bank competes in the marketplace with many sources that offer products that directly compete with traditional banking products. In keeping with our desire to provide our customers with a full array of financial services, we supplement the services traditionally offered by our Trust Department by staffing our community offices with wealth management consultants that are licensed and trained to sell variable and fixed rate annuities, mutual funds, stock brokerage services and long-term care insurance. Although the sale of these products can reduce the Bank's deposit levels, these products offer solutions for our customers that traditional bank products cannot and allow us to more completely service our\ncustomer base. Fee income from the sale of non-deposit products (primarily annuities and mutual funds) was $272,000 and $259,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively, of total non-interest income.\nOTHER INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES\nJuniata funds its needs primarily with local deposits and when necessary, relies on external funding sources for additional funding. External funding sources include credit facilities at correspondent banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Juniata's average balances for all borrowings increased by $8,945,000 in 2019 compared to 2018.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in Borrowings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAverage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(931)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,177\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,882)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(89.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,906\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,493\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther interest bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,560\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n42,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n33,136\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPENSION PLAN\nThe Company's noncontributory pension plan, the JVB Plan, covered substantially all its employees employed prior to December 31, 2007. As of January 1, 2008, the JVB Plan was amended to close the plan to new entrants. All active participants as of December 31, 2007 became 100% vested in their accrued benefit and, as long as they remained eligible, continued to accrue benefits until December 31, 2012. The benefits were based on years of service and the employee's compensation. Effective December 31, 2012, the JVB Plan was amended to cease future service accruals after that date (i.e., it was frozen).\nThe JVB Plan was amended in 2016 to provide pension benefits to all former FNBPA employees that were previously participants in the former Retirement Plan for the First National Bank of Port Allegany ( FNB Plan\u201d), as of November 30, 2015, at the same level of benefit provided in the FNB Plan. Effective December 31, 2016, the FNB Plan was merged into the JVB Plan, which was amended to provide the same benefits to the class of participants previously included in the FNB Plan.\nIn 2018, Juniata completed the second step of the strategy to reduce the liability associated with its defined benefit pension plan by making a lump sum payment offer to a small group of terminated vested participants in Juniata's defined benefit plan, which resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings of $210,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nJuniata's Board of Directors resolved to terminate the JVB Plan, effective November 30, 2018. All participants were properly notified. During the second quarter of 2019, JVB Plan participants elected preferences for receiving their vested benefit in the form of either lump sum payments or annuities. Those electing lump sums received payment in the second quarter, resulting in a pre-tax settlement charge of $278,000. In the third quarter of 2019, annuities were purchased to provide vested benefits to all remaining recipients, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $943,000. As of December 31, 2019, all obligations were satisfied, and The JVB Plan was liquidated. Please refer to Note 21 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nTotal stockholders' equity increased by $6,329,000, or 9.4%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The Company was well-capitalized and had the capacity to maintain its traditional dividend level in 2019. The Company's net income exceeded dividends paid by $1,346,000. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCI\u201d) to record the reclassification adjustment for gains on sales of debt securities, as well as the unrecognized net gains and the costs associated with the termination of the Company's defined benefit retirement plan increased equity by $4,898,000. Stock based compensation expense recorded pursuant to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan added $113,000 to stockholders' equity in 2019, while payments for exercised stock options increased shareholders' equity by $400,000. Treasury stock purchases during the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased stockholders' equity by $428,000.\nThe following table summarizes how the components of equity changed annually in the last two years.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n67,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59,387\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,904\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,489)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,411)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon stock issued for acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,463\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon stock issued for stock plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTreasury stock issued for stock plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase of stock, net of re-issuance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(428)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(70)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in unrealized security gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(807)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDefined benefit retirement plan adjustments, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,991\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n73,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n67,378\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage stockholders' equity in 2019 was $70,771,000, an increase of 12.9% from $62,689,000 in 2018, and was 59,938,000 in 2017. At December 31, 2019, Juniata held 42,020 shares of stock in treasury versus 42,201 at December 31, 2018. Return on average equity decreased to 8.24% in 2019 from 9.42% in 2018 partially due to the growth in average equity resulting from the increase in AOCI, as well as lower income in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in net income resulted from higher pension termination expenses in 2019, as well as well as the removal of the deferred tax liability in 2018 related to the Company's previous ownership of Liverpool, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $659,000 in 2018 compared to a net tax benefit of $14,000 in 2019. See the discussion in the 2019 Financial Overview section.\nThe Company periodically repurchases shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. In December of 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 200,000 shares of its common stock through its share repurchase program. The program will remain authorized until all approved shares are repurchased, unless terminated by the Board of Directors. Repurchases have typically been accomplished through open market transactions and have complied with all regulatory restrictions on the timing and amount of such repurchases. Shares repurchased have been added to treasury stock and accounted for at cost. These shares may be reissued for stock option exercises, employee stock purchase plan purchases, restricted stock awards, to fulfill dividend reinvestment program needs and to supply shares needed as consideration in an acquisition. During 2019 and 2018, 21,508 and 3,416 shares, respectively, were repurchased in conjunction with this program. There were also 800 restricted share awards forfeited in 2019. Treasury shares of 22,489 and 5,170 were also redeemed for stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Shares remaining authorized for repurchase in the program were 148,266 as of December 31, 2019.\nJuniata declared dividends of $0.88 per common share in both 2019 and 2018 (See Note 16 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding restrictions on dividends from the Bank to the Company). The dividend payout ratio was 76.93% and 74.71% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The dividend payout ratio in 2019 was greater than 2018 due to lower net income in 2019 compared to 2018. In January 2020, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.22 per share to stockholders of record on February 14, 2020, payable on February 28, 2020.\nJuniata's book value per share at December 31, 2019 was $14.45 as compared to $13.23 at December 31, 2018. Juniata's average equity to assets ratio for 2019 and 2018 was 10.93% and 10.20%, respectively. Refer also to the Capital Risk section in the Asset / Liability management discussion that follows.\nASSET / LIABILITY MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\nManagement believes that optimal performance is achieved by maintaining overall risks at a low level. Therefore, the objective of asset/liability management is to control risk and produce consistent, high quality earnings independent of changing interest rates. The Company has identified five major risk areas discussed below:\n \u00b7 Liquidity Risk \n \u00b7 Capital Risk \n \u00b7 Interest Rate Risk \n \u00b7 Investment Portfolio Risk \n \u00b7 Economic Risk \nLiquidity Risk\nThrough liquidity risk management, we seek to maintain our ability to readily meet commitments to fund loans, purchase assets and other securities and repay deposits and other liabilities. Liquidity management also includes the ability to manage unplanned changes in funding sources and recognize and address changes in market conditions that affect the quality of liquid assets. Juniata has developed a methodology for assessing its liquidity risk through an analysis of its primary and total liquidity sources. Juniata relies on three main types of liquidity sources: (1) asset liquidity, (2) liability liquidity and (3) off-balance sheet liquidity.\nAsset liquidity refers to assets that we are quickly able to convert into cash, consisting of cash, federal funds sold and securities. Short-term liquid assets generally consist of federal funds sold and securities maturing over the next twelve months. The quality of our short-term liquidity is very good; as federal funds are unimpaired by market risk and as bonds approach maturity, their value moves closer to par value. Liquid assets tend to reduce earnings when there is not an immediate use for such funds, since normally these assets generate income at a lower rate than loans or other longer-term investments.\nLiability liquidity refers to funding obtained through deposits. The largest challenge associated with liability liquidity is cost. Juniata's ability to attract deposits depends primarily on several factors, including sales effort, competitive interest rates and other conditions that help maintain consumer confidence in the stability of the financial institution. Large certificates of deposit, public funds and brokered deposits are all acceptable means of generating and providing funding. If the cost is favorable or fits the overall cost structure of the Bank, then these sources have many benefits. They are readily available, come in large block size, have investor-defined maturities and are generally low maintenance.\nOff-balance sheet liquidity is closely tied to liability liquidity. Sources of off-balance sheet liquidity include Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and federal funds lines with correspondent banks. These sources provide immediate liquidity to the Bank. They are available to be deployed when a need arises. These instruments also come in large block sizes, have investor-defined maturities and generally require low maintenance.\nAvailable liquidity\u201d encompasses all three sources of liquidity when determining liquidity adequacy. It results from the Bank's access to short-term funding sources for immediate needs and long-term funding sources when the need is determined to be permanent. Management uses both on-balance sheet liquidity and off-balance sheet liquidity to manage its liquidity position. The Company's liquidity strategy seeks to maintain an adequate volume of high-quality liquid instruments to facilitate customer liquidity demands. Management also maintains sufficient capital, which provides access to the liability and off-balance sheet sides of the balance sheet for funding. An active knowledge of debt funding sources is important to liquidity adequacy.\nContingency funding management involves maintaining contingent sources of immediate liquidity. Management believes that it must consider an array of available sources in terms of volume, maturity, cash flows and pricing. To meet demands in the normal course of business or for contingency, secondary sources of funding such as public funds deposits, collateralized loans, sales of investment securities or sales of loan receivables are considered.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain both a primary liquidity ratio and a total liquidity ratio greater than 10% of total assets. The primary liquidity ratio equals liquid assets divided by total assets, where liquid assets equal the sum of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with other banks and available for sale securities. Total\nliquidity is comprised of all components noted in primary liquidity plus securities classified as held-to-maturity, if any. If either of these liquidity ratios falls below 10%, it is the Company's policy to increase liquidity in a timely manner to achieve the required ratio.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain available liquidity greater than 10% of total assets and contingency liquidity greater than 7.5% of total assets.\nJuniata is a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which provides short-term liquidity and a source for long-term borrowings. The Bank uses this vehicle to satisfy temporary funding needs throughout the year. The Company had short-term borrowings of $9,700,000 on December 31, 2019 and $11,600,000 on December 31, 2018.\nThe Bank's maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $183,790,000 at December 31, 2019. In order to borrow additional amounts, the FHLB would require the Bank to purchase additional FHLB Stock. The FHLB is a source of both short-term and long-term funding. The Bank must maintain sufficient qualifying collateral to secure all outstanding advances.\nJuniata needs to have liquid resources available to fulfill contractual obligations that require future cash payments.\nCapital Risk\nThe Company maintains sufficient core capital to protect depositors and shareholders and to take advantage of business opportunities while ensuring that it has resources to absorb the risks inherent in the business. Federal banking regulators have established capital adequacy requirements for banks and bank holding companies based on risk factors, which require more capital backing for assets with higher potential credit risk than assets with lower credit risk.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, officially identified by the Basel Committee as Basel III\u201d. In July 2013, the FRB approved final rules to implement the Basel III capital framework which revises the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. The new minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 and were fully phased in on January 1, 2019.\nAs fully phased in, Basel III requires financial institutions to maintain: (a) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%; (b) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%; (c) a minimum ratio of total (that is, tier 1 plus tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%; and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). However, unless the Bank maintains an additional 2.5% capital conservation buffer\u201d above the percentages stated above in (a) - (c), the Company may be unable to obtain capital distributions from it, which could negatively impact the Company's ability to pay dividends, service debt obligations or repurchase common stock. In addition, such a failure could result in a restriction on the Company's ability to pay certain cash bonuses to executive officers, negatively impacting the Company's ability to retain key personnel.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Bank's current capital levels met the fully phased-in minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer, as prescribed in the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules. See Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Risk\nTable 5, presented below, illustrates the maturity distribution of the Company's interest-sensitive assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019. Earliest re-pricing opportunities for variable and adjustable rate products and scheduled maturities for fixed rate products have been placed in the appropriate column to compute the cumulative sensitivity ratio (ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities). Securities with call features are treated as though the call date is the maturity date. Through one year, the cumulative sensitivity ratio is 0.38, indicating a liability-sensitive balance sheet, when measured on a static basis.\nTABLE 5\nMATURITY DISTRIBUTION\nAs of December 31,

portfolio risk as the amount of appreciation or depreciation the investment portfolio will sustain when interest rates change. The securities portfolio will decline in value when interest rates rise and increase in value when interest rates decline. Securities with long maturities, excessive optionality (as a result of call features) and unusual indexes tend to produce the most market risk during interest rate movements. Rate shocks of minus 100 and plus 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points were applied to the securities portfolio to determine how Tier 1 capital would be affected if the securities portfolio had to be liquidated and all gains and losses were recognized. The test revealed that, as of December 31, 2019, the risk-based capital ratio would remain adequate under these scenarios.\nEconomic Risk\nEconomic risk is the risk that the long-term or underlying value of the Company will change if interest rates change. Economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) represents the change in the value of the balance sheet without regard to business continuity. Rate shocks are applied to all financial assets and liabilities, using parallel and non-parallel rate shifts of 100 to 400 basis points to estimate the change in EVE under the various hypothetical scenarios. As of December 31, 2019, in\na rising rate environment, the modeling results indicate that the Company's liabilities would increase in value slightly more than assets would lose value. A non-parallel 200 basis point increase shock in rates produced an estimated 6.8% increase in EVE, indicating a stable value well within Juniata's policy guidelines.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has numerous off-balance sheet loan obligations that exist in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit and letters of credit. Because many commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect that these commitments will have an adverse effect on its liquidity position.\nExposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nThe Company had outstanding loan origination commitments aggregating $97,037,000 and $72,755,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, the Company had $13,448,000 and $14,468,000 outstanding in unused lines of credit commitments extended to its customers at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Liverpool's consumer lines of credit.\nLetters of credit are instruments issued by the Company that guarantee payment by the Bank to the beneficiary in the event of default by the Company's customer in the non-performance of an obligation or service. Most letters of credit are extended for a one-year period. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The amount of the liability as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 for guarantees under letters of credit issued is not material.\nThe maximum undiscounted exposure related to these guarantees at December 31, 2019 was $2,624,000, and the approximate value of underlying collateral upon liquidation that would be expected to cover this maximum potential exposure was $23,429,000.\nIn 2017, the Company executed renewal agreements for technology outsourcing services through two outside service bureaus. Both agreements provide for termination fees if the Company cancels the services prior to the end of the 7-year commitment period that runs through May 31, 2024. At December 31, 2019, termination fees are estimated to be approximately $1,369,000 and $1,253,000 on the two contracts. The termination fees would decrease by approximately 15% in each succeeding year through 2024. Since the Company does not expect to terminate these services with either vendor prior to the end of the commitment periods, no liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2019.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThe performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation; therefore, the effect of inflation is normally not as significant to the Company as it is to other businesses and industries. During periods of high inflation, the money supply usually increases, and banks normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. A bank's operating expenses may increase during inflationary times as the price of goods and services increase.\nA bank's performance is also affected during recessionary periods. In times of recession, a bank usually experiences a tightening on its earning assets and on its profits. A recession is usually an indicator of higher unemployment rates, which could mean an increase in the number of nonperforming loans because of continued layoffs and other deterioration of consumers' financial condition.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.

( Company\u201d or Juniata\u201d) and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Juniata Valley Bank ( Bank\u201d). Juniata is a bank holding company that delivers financial services within its market, primarily central Pennsylvania. The Bank provides retail and commercial banking, trust, estate, and wealth management services through 16 offices in Juniata, Mifflin, Perry, Huntingdon, McKean, Potter and Centre counties. On April 30, 2018, Juniata, which previously owned 39.16%, or 1,214 of the 3,100 outstanding common shares of Liverpool Community Bank ( Liverpool\u201d or LCB\u201d), completed the acquisition of the remainder of Liverpool's outstanding common stock. Under the terms of a merger agreement between the parties, LCB merged with and into the Bank.\nThe overview is intended to provide a context for the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have attempted to identify the most important matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and the short-term and long-term opportunities, challenges and risks (including material trends and uncertainties) which we face. We also discuss the actions we are taking to address these opportunities, challenges and risks. The Overview is not intended as a summary of, or a substitute for review of, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS RELEVANT TO JUNIATA\nAs a financial services organization, Juniata's core business is most influenced by the level of, and movement of, interest rates. Lending and investing are done daily, using funding from deposits and borrowings, resulting in net interest income, the most significant portion of operating results. Through the use of asset/liability management tools, the Company continually evaluates the effects that possible changes in interest rates could have on operating results and balance sheet growth. Using this information, along with analysis of competitive factors, management designs and prices its products and services.\nGeneral economic conditions are relevant to Juniata's business. In addition, economic factors impact customers' needs for financing, thus affecting loan growth. Additionally, changes in the economy can directly impact the credit strength of existing and potential borrowers.\nFOCUS OF MANAGEMENT\nThe management of Juniata believes that it is important to know who and what we are in order to be successful. We must be aligned in our efforts to achieve goals. We've identified the four characteristics that define the Company and the personnel that support it. We are Committed, Capable, Caring and Connected. Management seeks to be the preeminent financial institution in its market area and measures its success by the five key elements described below.\nSHAREHOLDER SATISFACTION\nAbove all else, management is committed to maximizing the value of our shareholders' investment, through both stock value appreciation and dividend returns. Remaining connected to our communities will allow us to identify the financial needs of our market and to deliver those products and services capably. In doing so, we will seek to profitably grow the balance sheet and enhance earnings, while maintaining capital and liquidity levels that exceed all regulatory guidelines.\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nWe are committed to maximizing customer satisfaction. We are sensitive to the expanding array of financial services and financial service providers available to our customers, both locally and globally. We are committed to fostering a complete customer relationship by helping clients identify their current and future financial needs and offering practical and affordable solutions to both. As our customers' lifestyles change, the channels through which we deliver our services must change as well. One element of the Company's strategic plan is to provide connection through every means available, wherever we are needed, whether through a stand-alone branch, in-store boutique, ATM or via online and mobile banking anywhere internet or cell phone signals can be received. In 2019, we continued to make advances in technological resources, placing data and information in the hands of our customers and employees, because we are committed to optimizing the customer experience.\nBALANCE SHEET GROWTH\nWe are capable of profitable balance sheet growth. Rapid growth should not be a substitute for careful fiscal and strategic management. It is our goal to continue quality growth despite intense competition by paying careful attention to the needs of our customers. We will continue to maintain high credit standards, knowing that lending under the right circumstances is the proper way to maintain soundness and profitability. We believe we consistently pay fair market rates on all deposits and have invested wisely and conservatively in compliance with self-imposed standards, minimizing risk of asset impairment. We aspire to increase our market share within the current communities that we serve, and to expand in contiguous areas through acquisition and investment. As part of our strategic plan for growth, we continue to actively seek\nopportunities for acquisitions of branches or stakes in other financial institutions, similar to those that have occurred in prior years, and most recently in April 2018 with the acquisition of LCB.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nWe are capable of producing profitability ratios that exceed those of many of our peers. Recognizing that net interest margins have narrowed for banks in general and that they may not return to the ranges experienced in the past, we also focus on the importance of providing fee-generating services in which customers find value. Offering a broad array of services prevents us from becoming too reliant on one form of revenue. It has also been our philosophy to spend conservatively and to implement operating efficiencies where possible to keep non-interest expense from escalating in areas that can be controlled.\nCONNECTION TO THE COMMUNITY\nWe are active corporate citizens of the communities we serve. Although the world of banking has transitioned to global availability through electronics, we believe that our community banking philosophy is not only still valid, but essential. Despite technological advances, banking is still a personal business, particularly in the rural areas we serve. We believe that our customers shop for services and value a relationship with an institution involved in the same community, with the same interests in its prosperity. We have a foundation and a history in each of the communities we serve. Management takes an active role in local business and industry development organizations to help attract and retain commerce in our market area. We provide businesses, large and small, with financial tools and financing needed to grow and prosper. We have always been committed to responsible lending practices. We invest locally by including local municipal bonds in our investment portfolio and participating in funding for such projects as low income and elderly housing. We support charitable programs that benefit the local communities, not only with monetary contributions, but also through the personal involvement of our caring employees. In 2019, we initiated the JAVA with JVB program offering in-person training and online videos via social media to educate our customers and the communities we serve on various banking and financial related topics.\nJUNIATA'S OPPORTUNITIES\nSOUNDNESS AND STABILITY\nOur financial condition is strong. We enjoy strong capital and liquidity ratios that significantly exceed regulatory guidelines. Our business model includes a plan for growth without sacrificing profitability or integrity. We believe an opportunity exists for banks such as ours to offer the trusted, personal service of a locally managed institution that has roots in the community reaching back over 150 years.\nEXPANSION OF CUSTOMER BASE\nOur strategic focus is based on leveraging our collective knowledge of the Company's primary and contiguous markets to identify lending or fee-based opportunities consistent with our risk parameters and profitability targets. We continue to develop our sales team through mentoring and by making employee education paramount. We continually seek and implement back-room efficiencies. We recognize change is taking place in a world where convenience and mobility are priorities for consumers and businesses when choosing a financial institution with whom to do business. We offer full-featured secure mobile banking that includes remote check deposit for use on home computers and all mobile devices for consumers. For businesses, we provide options for cash management and remote deposit. We offer identity protection to the families of our customers, which we believe to be a true value-added service, with features that go far beyond traditional banking services, and sets us apart from other financial institutions in our market area. With the acquisition of First National Bank of Port Allegheny ( FNBPA\u201d) in 2015, we expanded our market into the northern tier region of Pennsylvania and integrated the JVB brand there and have since expanded our footprint in Perry County, Pennsylvania, through the consummation of the acquisition of LCB in April 2018.\nDELIVERY SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS\nWe seek to continually enhance our customer delivery system, both through technology and physical facilities. We actively seek opportunities to expand our branch network through acquisitions. We believe that it is imperative that our customers have convenient and easy access to personal financial services that complement their particular lifestyle, whether it is through electronic or personal delivery. We achieved an early entry into the mobile banking arena and have since expanded online delivery, including consumer remote deposit and Touch ID. Through the fully redesigned JVBonline.com website,\nwe offer a suite of online services including the convenience of online loan applications for residential mortgages, home equity, vehicle and other personal loans. Online and mobile banking features include full bill-pay and monetary transfers between internal and external accounts. Our ATM network is equipped with state-of-the art machines. Our Customer Care Center provides a dedicated service to address all customer inquiries and provides outreach through our social media sites. Our updated branch facilities feature a highly interactive and complete customer experience. In 2020, Juniata plans to add online deposit account opening capability to our product line.\nJUNIATA'S CHALLENGES\nNET INTEREST MARGIN COMPRESSION\nThe low interest rate environment that has persisted in recent years has pressured the net interest margin for most banks, including Juniata. Loans have been originated, acquired or repriced at lower rates, reducing the average rate earned on those assets. While the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, has also declined, the decline has not always occurred at the same pace as the decline in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, which can result in a narrowing of the net interest margin. We believe that increasing the net interest margin will continue to be a challenge until general market rates rise more significantly.\nCOMPETITION\nEach year, competition becomes more intense and global in nature. To meet this challenge, we attempt to stay in close contact with our customers, monitoring their satisfaction with our services through surveys, personal visits and networking in the communities we serve. We strive to meet or exceed our customers' expectations and deliver consistent high-quality service. We believe that our customers have become acutely aware of the value of local service, and we strive to maintain their confidence.\nRATE ENVIRONMENT\nWe intend to continue making what we believe to be rational pricing decisions for loans, deposits and non-deposit products. This strategy can be difficult to maintain, as many of our peers appear to continue pricing for growth, rather than long-term profitability and stability. We believe that a strategy of growth for the sake of growth\u201d results in lower profitability, and such actions by large groups of banks have had an adverse impact on the entire financial services industry. We intend to maintain our core pricing principles, which we believe protect and preserve our future as a sound community financial services provider, proven by results.\nREGULATIONS\nThe Company is subject to banking regulation, as well as regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) and, as such, must comply with many laws, including the USA Patriot Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Sarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Management has established a Disclosure Committee for Financial Reporting, an internal group at Juniata that seeks to ensure that current and potential investors in the Company receive full and complete information concerning our financial condition. Juniata has incurred direct and indirect costs associated with compliance with the SEC's filing and reporting requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as adherence to new and existing banking regulations and stronger corporate governance requirements. Regulatory burdens continue to increase as evidenced by the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that impact the Company in the areas of corporate governance, capital requirements and restrictions on fees that may be charged to consumers.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared based upon the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), the most significant of which are described in Note 2 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Certain of these policies, particularly with respect to allowance for loan losses and the investment portfolio, require numerous estimates and economic assumptions, based upon information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. As such, over time, they may prove inaccurate or vary and may significantly affect the Company's reported results and financial position in future periods.\nThe accounting policy for establishing the allowance for loan losses relies to a greater extent on the use of estimates than other areas and, as such, has a greater possibility of producing results that could be different from those currently reported. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in the allowance for loan losses could have a material impact on the Company's future financial condition and results of operations. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an evaluation of individual credits in the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2019 and 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\nThe comparability of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was impacted by the following events discussed in more detail below: (i) the termination of The Juniata Valley Bank Retirement Plan ( JVB Plan\u201d) and (ii) the acquisition of LCB. Juniata's management believes it is meaningful to present a performance comparison that segregates the financial impact of the afore-mentioned items, to allow a view of comparative results to 2018. The following discussion includes both GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental tables presented below. The non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted\u201d results.\nIn 2019, Juniata satisfied all obligations of the JVB Plan, recording pre-tax pension settlement charges of $1,221,000 during the year, compared to a pre-tax pension settlement charge of $210,000 recorded in 2018. The pre-tax charges represent the acceleration of pension expenses that would otherwise have impacted Juniata's future earnings.\nPrior to Juniata's acquisition of Liverpool on April 30, 2018, Juniata owned 39.16% of the outstanding common stock of Liverpool and recorded its share of Liverpool's earnings as income from unconsolidated subsidiary\u201d using the equity method of accounting. In conjunction with the acquisition, Juniata incurred $884,000 in merger-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018, while no merger-related expenses were incurred in 2019. An adjustment to the carrying value of Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership of Liverpool at April 30, 2018 resulted in a recorded pre-tax net gain of $215,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, a credit to the income tax provision of $406,000 was recorded in 2018 to remove a deferred tax liability related to Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership in Liverpool upon Juniata's acquisition of Liverpool, while no similar credit was recorded in 2019.\nNet income for Juniata in 2019 was $5,835,000, compared to net income of $5,904,000 for 2018. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis decreased from $1.18 in 2018 to $1.14 in 2019. When adjusted for the impact of the tax-effected events mentioned above, adjusted net income was $6,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 12.9% over adjusted net income of $6,024,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 9.9% from $1.21 in 2018 to $1.33 in 2019. For 2019, return on average assets ( ROA\u201d) and return on average equity ( ROE\u201d) were 0.90% and 8.24%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, return on average assets was 1.05% in 2019 compared to 0.98% in 2018, while return on average equity was 9.61% in both 2019 and 2018.\nThe net interest margin, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, decreased from 3.60% in 2018 to 3.57% in 2019. The yield on earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.31%, while the cost of funds increased 21 basis points, to 1.06%, in 2019 compared to 2018.\nBelow, and on the following page, are the comparative disclosures illustrating the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the previous page to GAAP financial measures for the most recent two years.\n\n\nJuniata strives to attain consistently satisfactory earnings levels each year by protecting the core (repeatable) earnings base through conservative growth strategies that seek to minimize stockholder and balance-sheet risk, while serving its rural\nPennsylvania customer base. This approach has helped achieve solid performances year after year. The Company considers the return on assets ratio to be a key indicator of its success and constantly scrutinizes the broad categories of the income statement that impact this profitability indicator.\nSummarized below are the components of net income and the contribution of each to ROA for 2019 and 2018.\n\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant component of revenue, comprising approximately 81% of total revenues (the total of net interest income and non-interest income, exclusive of security losses) for 2019. Interest spread measures the absolute difference between average rates earned and average rates paid. Because some interest earning assets are tax-exempt, an adjustment is made for analytical purposes to present all assets on a fully tax-equivalent basis. Net interest margin is the percentage of net return on average earning assets, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, and provides a measure of comparability of a financial institution's performance.\nBoth net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by interest rate changes, changes in the relationships between various rates and changes in the composition of the average balance sheet. Additionally, product pricing, product mix and customer preferences dictate the composition of the balance sheet and the resulting net interest income. Table 1 shows average asset and liability balances, average interest rates and interest income and expense for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017. Table 2 further shows changes attributable to the volume and rate components of net interest income.\nTABLE 1\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET INTEREST INCOME ANALYSIS\n\nNotes:\n (1) Average balances were calculated using a daily average. \n (2) Includes interest-bearing demand and money market accounts. \n (3) Net margin on interest earning assets is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets. \n (4) Interest on obligations of states and municipalities is not subject to federal income tax. In order to make the net yield comparable on a fully taxable basis, a tax equivalent adjustment is applied against the tax-exempt income utilizing a federal tax rate of 21% in both 2019 and 2018, and 34% in 2017. \nTABLE 2\nRATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME\n\nNotes:\n (5) Non-accruing loans are included in the above table until they are charged off. \n (6) The change in interest due to rate and volume has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. \n (7) Includes net unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale: ($486) in 2019, ($4,687) in 2018 and ($1,065) in 2017. \n (8) Interest income includes loan fees of $70, $95 and $89 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nOn average, total loans outstanding declined $1,042,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 due to less loan volume. Average total loans outstanding increased by 6.2%, to $409,362,000, in 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily due to the addition of Liverpool's loan portfolio, as well as organic growth. Average yields on loans increased by 26 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018, which was 23 basis points greater than 2017. As shown in Table 2, Rate - Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income, the increase in yield in 2019 raised interest income on loans by approximately $1,111,000, while the decline in volume decreased interest income by $111,000 compared to 2018, resulting in a net increase in interest recorded on loans of $1,000,000. Contributing 5 basis points to the increase in loan yields in 2019 was the collection of a substantial amount of previously unaccrued interest on a loan charged off in 2012. During 2018, the increase in loan yield increased interest income by approximately $858,000 compared to 2017, while the increase in volume increased interest income by $1,197,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on loans of $2,055,000 in 2018 compared to 2017. The prime rate declined 75 basis points during 2019, ending at 4.75%. During 2018, the prime rate increased by 100 basis points to end the year at 5.50%, which contributed to the increase in the average yield on loans in 2018 compared to 2017.\nDuring 2019, cash flows from maturities, sales and repayments of investment securities were reinvested into the securities portfolio, as were the additional funds from the growth in interest bearing liabilities. As a result, average balances of\ninvestment securities increased by $24,420,000, or 16.1%, during 2019 compared to 2018. This increase in volume accounted for a $610,000 increase in interest income compared to 2018. The 15 basis point improvement in the overall yield of the investment portfolio between 2019 and 2018 increased net interest income by $219,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on investment securities of $829,000 in 2019 compared to 2018.\nDuring 2018, cash flows from maturities, sales and repayments of investment securities were primarily used to fund a portion of the loan growth and pay off maturing long-term debt and pay down short-term borrowings. Additional funds from deposit growth were invested into the loan portfolio and used to pay down debt. As a result, average balances of investment securities decreased by $7,996,000, and this volume decline accounted for a $162,000 decrease in interest income compared to 2017. The improvement in the overall yield of the investment portfolio by 18 basis points between 2017 and 2018 increased net interest income by $256,000, resulting in an aggregate increase in interest recorded on investment securities of $94,000 in 2018 compared to 2017.\nIn total, yield on earning assets in 2019 was 4.31% compared to 4.18% in 2018 and 3.92% in 2017. On a fully tax equivalent basis, the yield on earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.37% in 2019, from 4.25% in 2018, which increased 20 basis points from 4.05% in 2017.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased by $17,755,000, or 4.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018, which increased $5,973,000 compared to 2017. Within the categories of interest bearing liabilities, deposits increased on average by $8,810,000 and average borrowings increased by $8,945,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. During 2018, average deposits increased by $29,683,000, while average borrowings declined by $23,710,000. The addition of Liverpool's deposits was the primary reason for the increase in average interest bearing deposits in 2018 as Liverpool's deposits were used to fund a reduction in overnight borrowings and the repayment of two FHLB long-term debt advances. Changes in the volume and rate of other interest-bearing liabilities, in aggregate, increased interest expense by $435,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, while the aggregate changes in volume and rate in 2018 decreased interest expense by $159,000 compared to 2017. The percentage of average interest earning assets funded by average non-interest bearing demand deposits was approximately 21.4% in 2019, compared to 23.1% in 2018 and 19.8% in 2017. The total cost to fund earning assets (computed by dividing the total interest expense by the total average earning assets) in 2019 was 0.79%, compared to 0.64% in 2018 and 0.52% in 2017. This increase was primarily caused by the flattening of the yield curve coupled with deposit rate competition.\nNet interest income was $20,906,000 for 2019, an increase of $890,000 when compared to 2018. Increases in both volume and rates contributed $456,000 and $434,000, respectively, toward the improved net interest income in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES\nJuniata's provision for loan losses is determined as a result of an analysis of the adequacy level of the allowance for loan losses. In order to closely reflect the potential losses within the current loan portfolio based upon current information known, the Company carries no unallocated allowance. Using the process of analysis described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies\u201d earlier in this discussion, the Company determined that a credit of $573,000 was appropriate for 2019, a decrease of $910,000 when compared to 2018 when the total loan loss provision was $337,000. A credit of $573,000 was recorded to the loan loss provision during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to net recoveries of $500,000 on previously charged off loans. Also contributing to the decline in the provision for loan losses in 2019 was a general improvement in credit quality factors, such as delinquency trends and classified loan balances. The discussion included in the Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses in the section below titled Financial Condition\u201d explains the information and analysis used to arrive at the provision for 2019.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nThe Company remains committed to providing comprehensive services and products to meet the current and future financial needs of its customers. Juniata believes its responsiveness to customers' needs surpasses that of many of its competitors and measures its success by the customer acceptance of fee-based services. The Company continually explores avenues to enhance product offerings in areas beneficial to its customers, such as adding new features and services for its electronic banking clientele. Fraud protection services are made available to all consumer depositors. We offer a variety of options for financing to home-buyers that includes a mortgage referral program, providing significant fee income.\nJuniata also provides alternative investment opportunities through an arrangement with a broker dealer that integrates the delivery of non-traditional products with Juniata's Trust and Wealth Management Division. This arrangement enables Juniata to meet the investment needs of a varied customer base and to better identify its clients' needs for traditional trust services.\nNon-interest income was $4,749,000 in 2019 compared to $5,027,000 in 2018. Most significantly impacting the comparative year-end periods was a decline in income/gain from unconsolidated subsidiary of $296,000, which included a $215,000 gain from the adjustment to the carrying value of Juniata's previous 39.16% ownership in Liverpool prior to its 100% acquisition. The equity method of accounting for the Liverpool investment was discontinued with the acquisition by Juniata of the remaining outstanding Liverpool shares in April 2018. Since then, all income and expense items from the newly acquired Liverpool office have been included as part of Juniata's operations in the appropriate line items in the financial statements.\nFee-generated non-interest revenues consist of customer service fees derived from deposit accounts, trust relationships and sales of non-deposit products. In 2019, revenues from these services totaled $2,383,000, representing a decrease of $85,000, or 3.4%, from 2018 revenues, primarily due to declines in customer service and trust fees. Total fees from customer deposits decreased by $62,000, or 3.5%. Fees from both estate settlements and non-estate fees declined by $28,000 and $8,000, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018. Variance in fees from estate settlements occurs because estate settlements occur sporadically and are not necessarily consistent year to year. Non-estate fees are repeatable revenues that generally increase and decrease in relation to movements in interest rates as market values of trust assets under management increase or decrease and as new relationships are established. Commissions from sales of non-deposit products increased in 2019, in comparison to 2018, by $13,000, or 5.0%, as sales increased.\nFees generated by debit card activity increased by $69,000, or 5.4%, in 2019 compared to the prior year due to general increased debit card usage.\nEarnings on bank-owned life insurance and annuities declined by $63,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 caused by a reporting modification by our split dollar insurance service provider in which the income is no longer separated from the expense as it was in prior years. The split dollar income is now netted against the expense within employee benefits expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Split dollar insurance income of $57,000 was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018, while there was no recorded income in 2019, which caused the majority of the decline in earnings on bank-owned life insurance and annuities in 2019 compared to 2018. The recorded net split dollar expense in 2019 was $30,000 compared to a net expense of $19,000 through the same period in 2018 based upon the gross expense of $76,000 recorded through December 31, 2018.\nOther non-interest-related fees derived from loan activity decreased by $83,000 when comparing 2019 to 2018, partially due to a recovery on a purchased LCB loan recorded in 2018, as well as declines in revenues generated from title insurance fees and the loan referral program.\nLosses realized from the sales and calls of investment securities during 2019 were $43,000 compared to losses of $188,000 in 2018. Strategies were undertaken in both years to replace lower yielding investments with higher yielding ones in order to position the portfolio for higher future returns.\nAs a percentage of average assets, non-interest income (excluding securities gains/losses on sales or calls of securities) was 0.74% and 0.85% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nManagement strives to control non-interest expense where possible in order to improve operating results. Non-interest expense was $20,407,000 in 2019 compared to $19,461,000 in 2018. The increase was driven by Juniata's growth resulting from the Liverpool acquisition; specifically, increases in employee compensation, occupancy, equipment, and data processing; as well as the termination of the JVB Plan.\nEmployee compensation expense increased $435,000, or 5.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018, predominantly due to accounting for a full year of the Liverpool staff in 2019 compared to eight months in 2018. Employee compensation and\nbenefits expense increased by $1,136,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to the recording of $1,221,000 in pre-tax pension settlement charges as a result of settling the remaining obligations associated with the final liquidation of the JVB Plan compared to $210,000 in pre-tax pension settlement charges recorded in 2018. Partially offsetting this increase were declines of $32,000 in medical expense in 2019 compared to 2018, as well as $45,000 in split dollar expense due to a reporting modification by our insurance service provider in 2019, which now nets the split dollar income against the expense as opposed to reporting the income separately as in prior years.\nData processing expense increased by $190,000, or 9.9%, in 2019 compared to 2018, along with an aggregate increase in occupancy and equipment expense of $142,000, or 7.0%, due to the increased expense of a full year of Liverpool's data processing, branch office, and equipment expenses in 2019 compared to eight months in 2018, as well as the completion of two remodeling projects in 2019.\nProfessional fees increased $321,000, or 50.2%, during 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was predominantly due to higher audit expenses related to an increase in fees incurred from the Company's former audit firm during the transition to the newly engaged firm. In addition, a new consulting arrangement to strengthen compliance reviews also added to the increased expense in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPartially offsetting these increases was a decline of $884,000 in merger and acquisition expenses as no similar expense was recorded in 2019, as well as an increase in the gain on sales of other real estate owned of $148,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. FDIC insurance premiums declined by $166,000 due to the application of small bank assessment credits applied in 2019, while none were applied in 2018.\nAs a percentage of average assets, non-interest expense was 3.15% in 2019 as compared to 3.17% in 2018. Excluding defined benefit settlement costs and merger expenses in both periods, non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets was 2.96% in 2019 compared to 3.14% in 2018, an improvement of 18 basis points.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome tax for 2019 amounted to a benefit of $14,000 versus a benefit of $659,000 in 2018. Impacting the income tax provision in 2018 was the removal of a $406,000 deferred tax liability related to the previous investment in unconsolidated subsidiary. Both periods included the effect of a tax credit amounting to $902,000 in 2019 and $901,000 in 2018. The tax credit was available to the Company as a result of an equity investment in two low-income housing projects. Juniata's effective tax rate in 2019 was (0.2)% versus (12.6)% in 2018. See Note 15 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nBALANCE SHEET SUMMARY\nJuniata functions as a financial intermediary and, as such, its financial condition can be best analyzed in terms of changes in its uses and sources of funds and can also be analyzed in terms of changes in daily average balances. The table below sets forth average daily balances for the last three years and the dollar change and percentage change for the past two years.\nTABLE 3\nCHANGES IN USES AND SOURCES OF FUNDS\n\nOverall, total average assets increased by $32,650,000, or 5.3%, for the year 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in long-term debt and interest bearing demand deposits, which were used to fund the purchases of additional taxable securities during the year. The ratio of average earning assets to total average assets was 91.9% in 2019, while it was 92.0% in 2018. The ratio of average interest-bearing liabilities to total average assets decreased in 2019 to 68.5% from 69.2% in 2018. Although Juniata's previous investment in its unconsolidated subsidiary, investment in low income elderly housing projects and its bank owned life insurance and annuities are not classified as interest-earning assets, income is derived directly from those assets. These instruments have represented 3.1% and 3.6% of total average\nassets in 2019 and 2018, respectively. A more detailed discussion of the Company's earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will follow in the Sections titled Loans\u201d, Investments\u201d and Deposits\u201d.\nLOANS\nLoans outstanding at the end of each year consisted of the following:\n\nFrom year-end 2018 to year-end 2019, total loans outstanding decreased by $17,041,000, primarily due to early paydowns on several large commercial loans and real estate mortgage runoff, which, combined, exceeded new loan volume. The following table summarizes how the ending balances changed annually in each of the last two years.\n\nThe loan portfolio was comprised of approximately 39.8% consumer loans (real estate - mortgage and personal loans) and 60.2% commercial loans (commercial, financial and agricultural, real estate - commercial and construction, and obligations of states and political subdivisions) on December 31, 2019 compared to 41.7% consumer loans and 58.3% commercial loans on December 31, 2018. Management believes that diversification in the loan portfolio is important, and management performs a loan concentration analysis on a quarterly basis. The highest loan concentration by activity type was real estate - commercial loans secured by income-producing property, with debt service on this category of loans being reliant upon the cash flow generated by the property. In the aggregate, loans in this category had outstanding balances of $95,305,000 at December 31, 2019, or 131.72% of the Bank's capital. Components of this concentration group with balances considered for general reserve purposes are as follows:\n\nGiven the reserves allocated to this sector over the past several years and the continuing softness in the market, management continues to assess a concentration risk factor to this group of loans when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. See Note 7 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2019, there was growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, as well as real estate - construction loans, which was offset by a decline is all other loan categories. The decrease was largely due to a few unanticipated real estate\n- commercial and obligations of states and political subdivision loan payoffs, as well as the competitive lending environment. There was growth in all loan categories in 2018, mainly due to the addition of Liverpool's loan portfolio, as well as organic growth. Juniata is willing, able and continues to lend to qualifying businesses and individuals. Our business model closely aligns lenders and community office managers' efforts to effectively develop referrals and existing customer relationships. Continued emphasis is placed on responsiveness and personal attention given to customers, which we believe differentiates the Bank from its competition. Nearly all commercial loans are either variable or adjustable rate loans, while non-mortgage consumer loans generally have fixed rates for the duration of the loan.\nJuniata strives to offer fair, competitive rates and to provide optimal service in order to attract loan growth. Emphasis will continue to be placed upon attracting the entire customer relationship of our borrowers.\nThe loan portfolio carries the potential risk of past due, non-performing or, ultimately, charged-off loans. The Bank attempts to manage this risk through credit approval standards and aggressive monitoring and collection efforts. Where prudent, the Bank secures commercial loans with collateral consisting of real and/or tangible personal property. The Company maintains a dedicated credit administration division, in response to the need for heightened credit review, both in the loan origination process and in the ongoing risk assessment process. Juniata's lending strategy and credit standards stress quality growth, diversified by product. A standardized credit policy is in place throughout the Company, and the credit committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves all loan requests for amounts that exceed management's approval levels. The Company makes credit judgments based on a customer's existing debt obligations, collateral, ability to pay and general economic trends. See Note 2 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses is determined in order to provide for probable losses on existing loans. A quarterly provision or credit is charged to earnings to maintain the allowance at adequate levels. Charge-offs and recoveries are recorded as adjustments to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was 0.74% of total loans, net of unearned interest compared to 0.73% of total loans, net of unearned interest, at the end of 2018. Loans that Juniata acquired through mergers and acquisitions, such as those acquired from Liverpool in 2018 and FNBPA in 2015 are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Acquired loans subsequently deemed impaired are included in the allowance for loan losses as impaired loans. Through loan amortization and other scheduled payments, the excluded balances become a smaller percentage of total outstanding loans over time, contributing to the increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans. The allowance decreased $73,000 when compared to December 31, 2018, as a result of recording net recoveries of $500,000 and a credit to the loan loss provision of $573,000 compared to net charge-offs of $242,000 in 2018 that were offset by the provision of $337,000. Net recoveries for 2019 were 0.12% compared to net charge-offs of 0.06% in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, non-performing loans (as defined in Table 4 below), as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses, were 74.4% as compared to 68.4% at December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans were 0.55% of loans as of December 31, 2019, and 0.50% of loans as of December 31, 2018. The increase in nonperforming loans in 2019 compared to 2018 was predominantly due to a $112,000 increase in non-accrual loans in 2019. Of the $2,202,000 in non-performing loans at December 31, 2019, only one loan for $14,000 was not collateralized with real estate.\nTABLE 4\nNON-PERFORMING LOANS\n\nLoans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or\nreasonable doubt exists as to the full, timely collection of principal or interest. However, it is the Company's policy to continue to accrue interest on loans over 90 days past due if (1) they are guaranteed or well secured and (2) there is an effective means of timely collection in process. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed against current period income, and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Interest received on non-accrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management's judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, accruals are resumed on loans only when the obligation is brought fully current with respect to interest and principal, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. The Company's non-accrual and charge-off policies are the same, regardless of loan type. During 2019, gross interest income that would have been recorded if loans on non-accrual status had been current was $130,000, of which $88,000 was collected and included in net income.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nThe amount of allowance for loan losses is determined through a critical quantitative and qualitative analysis performed by management that includes significant assumptions and estimates. It is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable estimated losses within the loan portfolio and supported by detailed documentation. To assess potential credit weaknesses, it is important to analyze observable trends that may be occurring.\nManagement systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis to provide for probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The Bank's methodology for maintaining the allowance is highly structured and contains two components: 1) specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated for impairment under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Section 310-10-35; and 2) allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20 (Contingencies).\nComponent for impaired loans:\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nThe estimated fair values of substantially all the Company's impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan's collateral. For commercial loans secured with real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the current appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values may be discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include the estimated costs to sell the property. For commercial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower's financial statements, inventory reports, aging accounts receivable, equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The Company generally does not separately identify individual consumer segment loans for impairment analysis, unless such loans are subject to a restructuring agreement.\nLoans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the Company grants borrower's concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve a below-market interest rate based on the loan's risk characteristics or an extension of a loan's stated maturity date. Non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal\nand interest payments, under the modified terms, are current for a sustained period after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 31 loans, with aggregate outstanding balances of $2,516,000, were evaluated for impairment. A collateral analysis was performed on each of these 31 loans in order to establish a portion of the reserve needed to carry impaired loans at no higher than fair value. As a result of this analysis, no loans were determined to have insufficient collateral, and therefore, no specific reserves were established. Loans acquired with credit impairment are considered to be impaired loans but are not included with this component for consideration in the allowance. They were carried at fair value of $1,070,000 as of December 31, 2019.\nComponent for pooled loan contingencies:\nA contingency is an existing condition, or set of circumstances, involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to the Company that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. These conditions may be considered in relation to individual loans or in relation to groups of similar types of loans. If the conditions are met, a provision is made even though the loans that are uncollectible may not be identifiable.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20, when measuring estimated credit losses, these loans are grouped into homogenous pools with similar characteristics and evaluated collectively considering both quantitative measures, such as historical loss, and qualitative measures, in the form of environmental adjustments.\nThese pools are established by general loan type, or \"class\" as follows:\n \u00b7 Commercial, financial and agricultural \n \u00b7 Real estate - commercial \n \u00b7 Real estate - construction \n \u00b7 Real estate - mortgage \n \u00b7 Obligations of states and political subdivisions \n \u00b7 Personal \nSome portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on \"class segments,\" which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For commercial, financial and agricultural loans, class segments include commercial loans secured by other-than real estate collateral. Real estate - commercial class segments include loans secured by farmland, multi-family properties, owner-occupied non-farm, non-residential properties and other nonfarm non-residential properties. Real estate - construction loan class segments include loans secured by commercial real estate, loans to commercial borrowers secured by residential real estate and loans to individuals secured by residential real estate. Real estate - mortgage includes loans secured by first and junior liens on residential real estate. Obligations of states and political subdivision loan class segment primarily includes tax-anticipation notes to local municipalities and other tax-exempt organizations. Personal loan class segments include direct consumer installment loans, indirect automobile loans and other revolving and unsecured loans to individuals.\nQuantitative factor determination:\nAn average annual loss rate is calculated for each pool through an analysis of historical losses over a five-year look-back period. Using data for each loan, a loss emergence period is determined within each segmented class pool. The loss emergence period reflects the approximate length of time from the point when a loss is incurred (the loss trigger event) to the point of loss confirmation (the date of eventual charge-off). The loss emergence period is applied to the average annual loss to produce the quantitative factor for each pooled class segment.\nQualitative factor determination:\nHistorical loss rates computed in the quantitative component reflects an estimate of the level of incurred losses in the portfolio based on historical experience. Management considers that the current conditions may deviate from those that prevailed over the historical look-back period. Thus, the quantitative rates are an imperfect estimate, necessitating an evaluation of qualitative considerations, i.e. environmental factors, to incorporate these risks.\nManagement considered qualitative, environmental risk factors including:\n \u00b7 National, regional and local economic and business conditions, and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; \n \u00b7 Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans; \n \u00b7 Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; \n \u00b7 Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending and credit management and other relevant staff; \n \u00b7 Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; \n \u00b7 Changes in the quality of the loan review system; \n \u00b7 Changes in lending policies and procedures including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices; \n \u00b7 Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; and \n \u00b7 Effect of external influences, including competition, legal and regulatory requirements. \nWithin each loan segment, an analysis was performed over a ten-year look-back period to discover peak historical losses, and with this data, management established ranges of risk from minimal to very high, for each risk factor, to produce a supportable anchor for risk assignment. Based on the framework for risk factor evaluation and range of adjustments established through the anchoring process, a risk assessment and corresponding adjustment was assigned for each portfolio segment as of December 31, 2019. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nThe combination of quantitative and qualitative factors was applied to year-end balances in each pooled segment to establish the overall allowance.\nA summary of activity in the allowance for loan loss for the last five years is shown below. The area most affected by charge-offs in each of the five years presented was real estate - mortgages, which balances accounted for approximately 38% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. The Company recorded net recoveries of $500,000 in 2019. Based on the analysis described above, the provision for loan loss in 2019 was 170% lower than in 2018. With the credit to the provision exceeding net recoveries, the loan loss allowance decreased by 2.4% over the December 31, 2018 allowance. Management's analysis indicated that the loan loss allowance of $2,961,000 at December 31, 2019 was adequate.\n\nThe following tables show how the allowance for loan losses is allocated among the various types of outstanding loans and the percent of loans by type to total loans.\n\n \n\nINVESTMENTS\nTotal investments, defined to include all interest earning assets except loans (i.e. debt securities available for sale at fair value), equity securities, federal funds sold, interest bearing deposits, restricted investment in bank stock and other interest-earning assets), totaled $217,564,000 on December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $67,923,000, or 45.5%, compared to year-end 2018. The following table summarizes how the ending balances changed annually in each of the last two years.\n\nOn average, total investments, as defined above, increased by $30,546,000, or 19.6%, during 2019. The increase in 2019 was mainly the result of the decline in loan growth along with an increase in interest bearing liabilities, mainly deposits and long-term debt, as these funds were used to purchase investment securities.\nThe investment area is managed according to internally established guidelines and quality standards. Juniata segregates its investment securities portfolio into two classifications: those held to maturity and those available for sale. Juniata classifies all new marketable investment securities as available for sale, and currently holds no securities in the held to maturity or trading classifications. At December 31, 2019, the market value of the entire securities portfolio was greater than amortized cost by $647,000 as compared to December 31, 2018, when the market value was less than amortized cost by $3,357,000. The weighted average life of the investment portfolio was 3.8 years on December 31, 2019 and 4.5 years on December 31, 2018. The weighted average maturity has remained short in order to achieve a desired level of liquidity. Table 5, Maturity Distribution\u201d, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition shows the remaining maturity or earliest possible repricing for investment securities.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of securities and the weighted average yields of such securities by contractual maturities or call dates. Yields on obligations of states and public subdivisions are presented on a tax-equivalent basis.\n\nBANK OWNED LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES\nThe Company periodically ensures the lives of certain bank officers in order to provide split-dollar life insurance benefits to some key officers and to offset the cost of providing post-retirement benefits through non-qualified plans. Some annuities are also owned to provide cash streams that match certain post-retirement liabilities. See Note 9 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes how the cash surrender values of these instruments changed annually in each of the last two years.\n\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nBranch Acquisition\nOn September 8, 2006, the Company acquired a branch office in Richfield, PA. Goodwill at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2,046,000. The core deposit intangible of $431,000 was fully amortized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The core deposit intangible was amortized over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but is measured annually for impairment.\nFNBPA Acquisition\nOn November 30, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of FNBPA and, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill related to the FNBPA acquisition was $3,402,000. In addition, a core deposit intangible in the amount of $303,000 was recorded and is being amortized over a ten-year period using a sum of the year's digits basis. Core deposit intangible amortization expense recorded in 2019 was $38,000 and, for the succeeding five years beginning 2020, is estimated to be $33,000, $27,000, $22,000, $16,000, and $10,000 per year, respectively, and $5,000 in total for years after\n2024. Core deposit and other intangible assets, net of amortization, was $113,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $151,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nLCB Acquisition\nOn April 30, 2018, Juniata completed the acquisition of LCB and, as a result, recorded goodwill of $3,691,000 as of December 31, 2018. ASC 805 allows for adjustments to the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities, and the resulting goodwill for a period of up to one year after the merger date for new information that becomes available reflecting circumstances at the merger date. During the first quarter of 2019, Juniata recorded a $92,000 credit adjustment to goodwill relating to the tax treatment of Liverpool's acquired net operating loss, resulting in goodwill of $3,599,000 as of December 31, 2019. In addition, a core deposit intangible of $289,000 was recorded and will be amortized over a ten-year period using a sum of the years' digits basis. Core deposit intangible expense recorded in 2019 was $49,000, and for the succeeding five years beginning 2020, is estimated to be $44,000, $39,000, $33,000, $28,000, and $23,000 per year, respectively, and $38,000 in total for years after 2024. Core deposit intangible, net of amortization, was $205,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $254,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nDue to a strategic shift in focus to a new mortgage product, which is increasing fees derived from loan activity, the Company did not originate and sell residential mortgage loans to the secondary market in 2019 or 2018; however, the Company retained the servicing rights on loans originated and sold in prior years. The mortgage servicing rights are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows on pools of mortgages stratified by rate and maturity date. The computed value is carried as an intangible asset. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights was $180,000 and $200,000, respectively.\nDEFERRED TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset/liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, if applicable. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable. Management established a valuation allowance of $34,000 in 2019 for a capital loss carryforward for which the tax benefit is not likely to be realized. No such valuation allowance was established at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of $589,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, which was carried as a non-interest earning asset.\nIn 2018, the value of the Juniata's deferred tax asset was adjusted due primarily to a defined benefit contribution applied to the prior tax year, along with the removal of a deferred tax liability no longer applicable. The net adjustment resulted in a decrease in tax expense in 2018 of $168,000. The remainder of the difference was due to the various other changes in gross temporary tax differences. See Note 15 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOTHER NON-INTEREST EARNING ASSETS\nThe following table summarizes the components of the non-interest earning asset category, and how the ending balances changed annually over the last two years.\n\nDEPOSITS\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits were $531,937,000, an increase of $10,215,000 as compared to the previous year end. Deposits assumed from the LCB acquisition accounted for an increase of $36,052,000 in 2018. The following table summarizes how the ending balances changed annually over the last two years.\n\nThe following table shows the comparison of average core deposits and average time deposits as a percentage of total deposits for the last two years.\n\nAverage deposits increased $15,866,000, or 3.1%, to $528,627,000 in 2019. Core transaction accounts increased by 4.1% in 2019. The largest dollar increase in 2019 compared the previous year was $7,056,000 in non-interest demand accounts, while the largest percentage increase of 13.8% was in money market accounts. In addition to our deposit products, we continue to provide alternatives to our customers through the sale of our wealth management (non-deposit) products.\nThe consumer continues to have a need for transaction accounts, and the Bank is continuing to focus on that need in order to build deposit relationships. Our products are geared toward low-cost convenience and ease for the customer. The Company's strategy is to aggressively seek to grow customer relationships by staying in touch with customers' changing needs and new methods of connectivity, in an effort to increase deposit (and loan) market share. The Bank offers identity protection services as an option for all consumer demand depositors. We believe this product to be a valuable and essential tool necessary to combat the upsurge in fraud and identity theft. This product is a unique benefit to our customers as there are no other banks in our immediate market that offer a similar service.\nThe Bank competes in the marketplace with many sources that offer products that directly compete with traditional banking products. In keeping with our desire to provide our customers with a full array of financial services, we supplement the services traditionally offered by our Trust Department by staffing our community offices with wealth management consultants that are licensed and trained to sell variable and fixed rate annuities, mutual funds, stock brokerage services and long-term care insurance. Although the sale of these products can reduce the Bank's deposit levels, these products offer solutions for our customers that traditional bank products cannot and allow us to more completely service our\ncustomer base. Fee income from the sale of non-deposit products (primarily annuities and mutual funds) was $272,000 and $259,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively, of total non-interest income.\nOTHER INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES\nJuniata funds its needs primarily with local deposits and when necessary, relies on external funding sources for additional funding. External funding sources include credit facilities at correspondent banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Juniata's average balances for all borrowings increased by $8,945,000 in 2019 compared to 2018.\n\nPENSION PLAN\nThe Company's noncontributory pension plan, the JVB Plan, covered substantially all its employees employed prior to December 31, 2007. As of January 1, 2008, the JVB Plan was amended to close the plan to new entrants. All active participants as of December 31, 2007 became 100% vested in their accrued benefit and, as long as they remained eligible, continued to accrue benefits until December 31, 2012. The benefits were based on years of service and the employee's compensation. Effective December 31, 2012, the JVB Plan was amended to cease future service accruals after that date (i.e., it was frozen).\nThe JVB Plan was amended in 2016 to provide pension benefits to all former FNBPA employees that were previously participants in the former Retirement Plan for the First National Bank of Port Allegany ( FNB Plan\u201d), as of November 30, 2015, at the same level of benefit provided in the FNB Plan. Effective December 31, 2016, the FNB Plan was merged into the JVB Plan, which was amended to provide the same benefits to the class of participants previously included in the FNB Plan.\nIn 2018, Juniata completed the second step of the strategy to reduce the liability associated with its defined benefit pension plan by making a lump sum payment offer to a small group of terminated vested participants in Juniata's defined benefit plan, which resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings of $210,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nJuniata's Board of Directors resolved to terminate the JVB Plan, effective November 30, 2018. All participants were properly notified. During the second quarter of 2019, JVB Plan participants elected preferences for receiving their vested benefit in the form of either lump sum payments or annuities. Those electing lump sums received payment in the second quarter, resulting in a pre-tax settlement charge of $278,000. In the third quarter of 2019, annuities were purchased to provide vested benefits to all remaining recipients, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $943,000. As of December 31, 2019, all obligations were satisfied, and The JVB Plan was liquidated. Please refer to Note 21 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nTotal stockholders' equity increased by $6,329,000, or 9.4%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The Company was well-capitalized and had the capacity to maintain its traditional dividend level in 2019. The Company's net income exceeded dividends paid by $1,346,000. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCI\u201d) to record the reclassification adjustment for gains on sales of debt securities, as well as the unrecognized net gains and the costs associated with the termination of the Company's defined benefit retirement plan increased equity by $4,898,000. Stock based compensation expense recorded pursuant to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan added $113,000 to stockholders' equity in 2019, while payments for exercised stock options increased shareholders' equity by $400,000. Treasury stock purchases during the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased stockholders' equity by $428,000.\nThe following table summarizes how the components of equity changed annually in the last two years.\n\nAverage stockholders' equity in 2019 was $70,771,000, an increase of 12.9% from $62,689,000 in 2018, and was 59,938,000 in 2017. At December 31, 2019, Juniata held 42,020 shares of stock in treasury versus 42,201 at December 31, 2018. Return on average equity decreased to 8.24% in 2019 from 9.42% in 2018 partially due to the growth in average equity resulting from the increase in AOCI, as well as lower income in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in net income resulted from higher pension termination expenses in 2019, as well as well as the removal of the deferred tax liability in 2018 related to the Company's previous ownership of Liverpool, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $659,000 in 2018 compared to a net tax benefit of $14,000 in 2019. See the discussion in the 2019 Financial Overview section.\nThe Company periodically repurchases shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. In December of 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 200,000 shares of its common stock through its share repurchase program. The program will remain authorized until all approved shares are repurchased, unless terminated by the Board of Directors. Repurchases have typically been accomplished through open market transactions and have complied with all regulatory restrictions on the timing and amount of such repurchases. Shares repurchased have been added to treasury stock and accounted for at cost. These shares may be reissued for stock option exercises, employee stock purchase plan purchases, restricted stock awards, to fulfill dividend reinvestment program needs and to supply shares needed as consideration in an acquisition. During 2019 and 2018, 21,508 and 3,416 shares, respectively, were repurchased in conjunction with this program. There were also 800 restricted share awards forfeited in 2019. Treasury shares of 22,489 and 5,170 were also redeemed for stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Shares remaining authorized for repurchase in the program were 148,266 as of December 31, 2019.\nJuniata declared dividends of $0.88 per common share in both 2019 and 2018 (See Note 16 of The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding restrictions on dividends from the Bank to the Company). The dividend payout ratio was 76.93% and 74.71% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The dividend payout ratio in 2019 was greater than 2018 due to lower net income in 2019 compared to 2018. In January 2020, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.22 per share to stockholders of record on February 14, 2020, payable on February 28, 2020.\nJuniata's book value per share at December 31, 2019 was $14.45 as compared to $13.23 at December 31, 2018. Juniata's average equity to assets ratio for 2019 and 2018 was 10.93% and 10.20%, respectively. Refer also to the Capital Risk section in the Asset / Liability management discussion that follows.\nASSET / LIABILITY MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\nManagement believes that optimal performance is achieved by maintaining overall risks at a low level. Therefore, the objective of asset/liability management is to control risk and produce consistent, high quality earnings independent of changing interest rates. The Company has identified five major risk areas discussed below:\n \u00b7 Liquidity Risk \n \u00b7 Capital Risk \n \u00b7 Interest Rate Risk \n \u00b7 Investment Portfolio Risk \n \u00b7 Economic Risk \nLiquidity Risk\nThrough liquidity risk management, we seek to maintain our ability to readily meet commitments to fund loans, purchase assets and other securities and repay deposits and other liabilities. Liquidity management also includes the ability to manage unplanned changes in funding sources and recognize and address changes in market conditions that affect the quality of liquid assets. Juniata has developed a methodology for assessing its liquidity risk through an analysis of its primary and total liquidity sources. Juniata relies on three main types of liquidity sources: (1) asset liquidity, (2) liability liquidity and (3) off-balance sheet liquidity.\nAsset liquidity refers to assets that we are quickly able to convert into cash, consisting of cash, federal funds sold and securities. Short-term liquid assets generally consist of federal funds sold and securities maturing over the next twelve months. The quality of our short-term liquidity is very good; as federal funds are unimpaired by market risk and as bonds approach maturity, their value moves closer to par value. Liquid assets tend to reduce earnings when there is not an immediate use for such funds, since normally these assets generate income at a lower rate than loans or other longer-term investments.\nLiability liquidity refers to funding obtained through deposits. The largest challenge associated with liability liquidity is cost. Juniata's ability to attract deposits depends primarily on several factors, including sales effort, competitive interest rates and other conditions that help maintain consumer confidence in the stability of the financial institution. Large certificates of deposit, public funds and brokered deposits are all acceptable means of generating and providing funding. If the cost is favorable or fits the overall cost structure of the Bank, then these sources have many benefits. They are readily available, come in large block size, have investor-defined maturities and are generally low maintenance.\nOff-balance sheet liquidity is closely tied to liability liquidity. Sources of off-balance sheet liquidity include Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and federal funds lines with correspondent banks. These sources provide immediate liquidity to the Bank. They are available to be deployed when a need arises. These instruments also come in large block sizes, have investor-defined maturities and generally require low maintenance.\nAvailable liquidity\u201d encompasses all three sources of liquidity when determining liquidity adequacy. It results from the Bank's access to short-term funding sources for immediate needs and long-term funding sources when the need is determined to be permanent. Management uses both on-balance sheet liquidity and off-balance sheet liquidity to manage its liquidity position. The Company's liquidity strategy seeks to maintain an adequate volume of high-quality liquid instruments to facilitate customer liquidity demands. Management also maintains sufficient capital, which provides access to the liability and off-balance sheet sides of the balance sheet for funding. An active knowledge of debt funding sources is important to liquidity adequacy.\nContingency funding management involves maintaining contingent sources of immediate liquidity. Management believes that it must consider an array of available sources in terms of volume, maturity, cash flows and pricing. To meet demands in the normal course of business or for contingency, secondary sources of funding such as public funds deposits, collateralized loans, sales of investment securities or sales of loan receivables are considered.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain both a primary liquidity ratio and a total liquidity ratio greater than 10% of total assets. The primary liquidity ratio equals liquid assets divided by total assets, where liquid assets equal the sum of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with other banks and available for sale securities. Total\nliquidity is comprised of all components noted in primary liquidity plus securities classified as held-to-maturity, if any. If either of these liquidity ratios falls below 10%, it is the Company's policy to increase liquidity in a timely manner to achieve the required ratio.\nIt is the Company's policy to maintain available liquidity greater than 10% of total assets and contingency liquidity greater than 7.5% of total assets.\nJuniata is a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which provides short-term liquidity and a source for long-term borrowings. The Bank uses this vehicle to satisfy temporary funding needs throughout the year. The Company had short-term borrowings of $9,700,000 on December 31, 2019 and $11,600,000 on December 31, 2018.\nThe Bank's maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $183,790,000 at December 31, 2019. In order to borrow additional amounts, the FHLB would require the Bank to purchase additional FHLB Stock. The FHLB is a source of both short-term and long-term funding. The Bank must maintain sufficient qualifying collateral to secure all outstanding advances.\nJuniata needs to have liquid resources available to fulfill contractual obligations that require future cash payments.\nCapital Risk\nThe Company maintains sufficient core capital to protect depositors and shareholders and to take advantage of business opportunities while ensuring that it has resources to absorb the risks inherent in the business. Federal banking regulators have established capital adequacy requirements for banks and bank holding companies based on risk factors, which require more capital backing for assets with higher potential credit risk than assets with lower credit risk.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, officially identified by the Basel Committee as Basel III\u201d. In July 2013, the FRB approved final rules to implement the Basel III capital framework which revises the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. The new minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 and were fully phased in on January 1, 2019.\nAs fully phased in, Basel III requires financial institutions to maintain: (a) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%; (b) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%; (c) a minimum ratio of total (that is, tier 1 plus tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%; and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). However, unless the Bank maintains an additional 2.5% capital conservation buffer\u201d above the percentages stated above in (a) - (c), the Company may be unable to obtain capital distributions from it, which could negatively impact the Company's ability to pay dividends, service debt obligations or repurchase common stock. In addition, such a failure could result in a restriction on the Company's ability to pay certain cash bonuses to executive officers, negatively impacting the Company's ability to retain key personnel.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Bank's current capital levels met the fully phased-in minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer, as prescribed in the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules. See Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Risk\nTable 5, presented below, illustrates the maturity distribution of the Company's interest-sensitive assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019. Earliest re-pricing opportunities for variable and adjustable rate products and scheduled maturities for fixed rate products have been placed in the appropriate column to compute the cumulative sensitivity ratio (ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities). Securities with call features are treated as though the call date is the maturity date. Through one year, the cumulative sensitivity ratio is 0.38, indicating a liability-sensitive balance sheet, when measured on a static basis.\nTABLE 5\nMATURITY DISTRIBUTION\nAs of December 31, 2019\nRemaining Maturity / Earliest Possible Repricing\n\nInvestment Portfolio Risk\nManagement considers its investment portfolio risk as the amount of appreciation or depreciation the investment portfolio will sustain when interest rates change. The securities portfolio will decline in value when interest rates rise and increase in value when interest rates decline. Securities with long maturities, excessive optionality (as a result of call features) and unusual indexes tend to produce the most market risk during interest rate movements. Rate shocks of minus 100 and plus 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points were applied to the securities portfolio to determine how Tier 1 capital would be affected if the securities portfolio had to be liquidated and all gains and losses were recognized. The test revealed that, as of December 31, 2019, the risk-based capital ratio would remain adequate under these scenarios.\nEconomic Risk\nEconomic risk is the risk that the long-term or underlying value of the Company will change if interest rates change. Economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) represents the change in the value of the balance sheet without regard to business continuity. Rate shocks are applied to all financial assets and liabilities, using parallel and non-parallel rate shifts of 100 to 400 basis points to estimate the change in EVE under the various hypothetical scenarios. As of December 31, 2019, in\na rising rate environment, the modeling results indicate that the Company's liabilities would increase in value slightly more than assets would lose value. A non-parallel 200 basis point increase shock in rates produced an estimated 6.8% increase in EVE, indicating a stable value well within Juniata's policy guidelines.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has numerous off-balance sheet loan obligations that exist in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit and letters of credit. Because many commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect that these commitments will have an adverse effect on its liquidity position.\nExposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nThe Company had outstanding loan origination commitments aggregating $97,037,000 and $72,755,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, the Company had $13,448,000 and $14,468,000 outstanding in unused lines of credit commitments extended to its customers at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Liverpool's consumer lines of credit.\nLetters of credit are instruments issued by the Company that guarantee payment by the Bank to the beneficiary in the event of default by the Company's customer in the non-performance of an obligation or service. Most letters of credit are extended for a one-year period. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The amount of the liability as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 for guarantees under letters of credit issued is not material.\nThe maximum undiscounted exposure related to these guarantees at December 31, 2019 was $2,624,000, and the approximate value of underlying collateral upon liquidation that would be expected to cover this maximum potential exposure was $23,429,000.\nIn 2017, the Company executed renewal agreements for technology outsourcing services through two outside service bureaus. Both agreements provide for termination fees if the Company cancels the services prior to the end of the 7-year commitment period that runs through May 31, 2024. At December 31, 2019, termination fees are estimated to be approximately $1,369,000 and $1,253,000 on the two contracts. The termination fees would decrease by approximately 15% in each succeeding year through 2024. Since the Company does not expect to terminate these services with either vendor prior to the end of the commitment periods, no liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2019.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThe performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation; therefore, the effect of inflation is normally not as significant to the Company as it is to other businesses and industries. During periods of high inflation, the money supply usually increases, and banks normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. A bank's operating expenses may increase during inflationary times as the price of goods and services increase.\nA bank's performance is also affected during recessionary periods. In times of recession, a bank usually experiences a tightening on its earning assets and on its profits. A recession is usually an indicator of higher unemployment rates, which could mean an increase in the number of nonperforming loans because of continued layoffs and other deterioration of consumers' financial condition.", "item_7_tables": "Table 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr>
