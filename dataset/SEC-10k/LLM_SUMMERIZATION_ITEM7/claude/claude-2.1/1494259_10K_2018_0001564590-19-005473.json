    "item_7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and our performance and future success, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. In this discussion, we use financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These rules regarding non-GAAP financial measures require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from or in substitution for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\nCompany Overview\nCarGurus is a global, online automotive marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of new and used cars. Using proprietary technology, search algorithms, and innovative data analytics, we provide information and analysis that create a differentiated automotive search experience for consumers. Our trusted marketplace empowers users with unbiased third-party validation on pricing and dealer reputation as well as other information that aids them in finding Great Deals from Top-Rated Dealers.\u201d In addition to the United States, we operate online marketplaces in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\nWe generate marketplace subscription revenue from dealers through Listing and Dealer Display subscriptions, and advertising revenue from automobile manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers. We generated revenue of $454.1 million in 2018, $316.9 million in 2017, and $198.1 million in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 43% in 2018 and 60% in 2017.\nIn 2018, we generated net income of $65.2 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $49.0 million, compared to a net income of $13.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $24.1 million in 2017, and a net income of $6.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $11.0 million in 2016. See Selected Consolidated Financial Data - Adjusted EBITDA\u201d for more information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income.\nWe have two reportable segments, United States and International. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics listed below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make operating and strategic decisions. We believe it is important to evaluate these metrics for the United States and International segments. The International segment derives revenues from marketplace subscriptions, advertising services, and other revenues from customers outside of the United States. International markets perform differently from the United States market due to a variety of factors, including our operating history in the market, our rate of investment, market size, market maturity, and other dynamics unique to each country.\nMonthly Unique Users\nFor each of our websites, we define a monthly unique user as an individual who visited such website within a calendar month, based on data as measured by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of the monthly unique users in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique device identifier accesses one of our websites during a calendar month. If an individual accesses one of our websites using a different device within a given month, the first access by each such device is counted as a separate unique user. We view our average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the quality of our user experience, the effectiveness of our advertising and traffic acquisition, and the strength of our brand awareness. Measuring unique users is important to us because our marketplace subscription revenue depends, in part, on our ability to provide dealers with connections to our users and exposure to our marketplace audience. We define connections as interactions between consumers and dealers on our marketplace through phone calls, email, managed text and chat, and clicks to access the dealer's website or map directions to the dealership.\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Monthly Unique Users\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMonthly Sessions\nWe define monthly sessions as the number of distinct visits to our websites that take place each month within a given time frame, as measured and defined by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly sessions as the sum of the monthly sessions in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. A session is defined as beginning with the first page view from a computer or mobile device and ending at the earliest of when a user closes their browser window, after 30 minutes of inactivity, or at midnight Eastern Time each night. A session can be made up of multiple page views and visitor actions, such as performing a search, visiting vehicle detail pages, and connecting with a dealer. We believe the volume of sessions in a time period, when considered in conjunction with the number of unique users in that time period, is an indicator of consumer satisfaction and engagement with our marketplace.\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Monthly Sessions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNumber of Paying Dealers\nA paying dealer is a dealer, based on a distinct associated inventory feed, that subscribes to our Enhanced or Featured Listing product at the end of a defined period. We believe that the number of paying dealers is indicative of the value proposition of our Listing products, and our sales and marketing success, including our ability to retain paying dealers and develop new dealer relationships.\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of Paying Dealers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Annual Revenue per Subscribing Dealer (AARSD)\nWe measure the average annual revenue we receive from each paying dealer. We define AARSD, which is measured at the end of a defined period, as the total marketplace subscription revenue during the trailing 12 months divided by the average number of paying dealers during the same trailing 12-month period. We believe that our ability to grow AARSD is an indicator of the value proposition of our products and the return on investment, or ROI, our paying dealers realize from our products. Increases in AARSD, which we believe reflect the value of exposure to our engaged audience in relation to subscription cost, are driven by our ability to grow the volume of connections to our users and the quality of those connections, which result in increased opportunity to upsell package levels and cross-sell additional products to our paying dealers.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Annual Revenue per Subscribing Dealer (AARSD)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other (income) expense, net, the (benefit from) provision for income taxes, and certain one-time, non-recurring items, if and when applicable. We monitor and have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a non-GAAP financial measure to supplement the financial information we present on a GAAP basis to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA, as a non-GAAP financial measure, should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We consider, and you should consider, Adjusted EBITDA together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP measure may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a key indicator of our operating results. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this measure and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, please see Selected Consolidated Financial Data - Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\nComponents of Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from two primary sources: (i) marketplace subscription revenue and (ii) advertising and other revenue, as described below.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nWe offer three types of marketplace Listing products to dealers: Basic Listing, which is free; and Enhanced or Featured Listing, which require a paid subscription under a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis. Contractual subscriptions for customers generally auto-renew on a monthly basis and are cancellable by dealers with 30-days' advance notice. We also offer Listing dealers access to the Dealer Dashboard, which includes a performance summary, Dealer Insights tool, user review management platform, Pricing Tool, and Market Analysis tool. The Pricing Tool and Market Analysis tool are available only to paying dealers.\nIn addition to listing inventory in the marketplace and providing access to the Dealer Dashboard, we offer Enhanced and Featured Listing dealers other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products, including display advertising that appears in our marketplace and on other sites on the internet. This advertising can be targeted by geography, search history, and a number of other factors, and dealer search engine marketing, which helps dealers more effectively acquire customers through paid search, social media, and retargeted advertising.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nAdvertising and other revenue consists primarily of non-dealer display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers sold on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. An impression is an advertisement loaded on a web page. In addition to advertising sold on a CPM basis, we also have advertising sold on a cost per click basis. Auto manufacturers and other brand advertisers can execute advertising campaigns that are targeted across a wide variety of parameters, including demographic groups, behavioral characteristics, specific auto brands, categories such as Certified Pre-Owned, and segments such as hybrid vehicles.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see - Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates.\u201d\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to supporting and hosting our product offerings. These costs include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation expense related to the customer support team and third-party service provider costs such as data center and networking expenses, allocated overhead, depreciation and amortization expense associated with our property and equipment, and amortization of capitalized website development costs. We allocate overhead costs, such as rent and facility costs, information technology costs, and employee benefit costs, to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category. We expect these expenses to increase as we continue to scale our business and introduce new products.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, commissions, stock-based compensation expense, and travel costs; costs associated with consumer marketing, such as traffic acquisition, brand building, and public relations activities; costs associated with dealer marketing, such as content marketing, customer and promotional events, and industry events; and allocated overhead. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we grow our audience and attempt to strengthen our brand awareness and, as informed by trends in our business and the competitive landscape of our market, fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which will impact our quarterly results of operations.\nProduct, Technology, and Development\nProduct, technology, and development expenses, which include research and development costs, consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including payroll, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. Other than website development costs and other costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect product, technology, and development expenses to increase as we develop new products and make improvements to our existing platform.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation expense, in addition to the costs associated with professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, insurance premiums, payment processing and billing costs, and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including legal, audit, and consulting fees.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on property and equipment and leasehold improvements.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, interest expense on lease obligations, and net foreign exchange gains and losses.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have recognized a benefit from income taxes for the period ended December 31, 2018 as a result of stock-based compensation benefits recorded. We have recorded a provision for income taxes for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as a result of our consolidated taxable income position. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. We regularly assess the need to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have not provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

This increase in marketplace subscription revenue was attributable primarily to a 14% growth in the number of United States and International paying dealers, to 31,472 as of December 31, 2018 from 27,670 as of December 31, 2017, and to a 23% growth in our AARSD for United States dealers to $14,819 as of December 31, 2018 from $12,055 as of December 31, 2017. The increase in paying dealers was driven by the efforts of our sales and marketing teams to subscribe dealers to our Enhanced and Featured Listing paid products. The increase in our AARSD for United States dealers was driven by the investments made in building our brand and growing our audience which resulted in growth in volume of connections.\nAdvertising and other revenue increased $14.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and represented 11% of total revenue in 2018 and 2017. The increase in advertising and other revenue was due primarily to a 70% increase in the number of impressions, which was partially offset by a 17% decrease in the average price per thousand impressions, in 2018 compared to 2017.\nRevenue by Segment\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 437,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 307,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 454,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 316,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 137,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnited States revenue increased $129.7 million, or 42%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to a 10% increase in the number of United States paying dealers and a 23% increase in AARSD for United States dealers.\nInternational revenue increased $7.5 million, or 80%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to a 55% increase in the number of International paying dealers.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also due to a $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of expense related to RSUs with a performance condition satisfied on the effectiveness of the registration statement for our IPO.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $9.9 million, or 77%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily reflected an increase of $5.0 million of salaries and employee-related costs as a result of our 81% increase in headcount as we continued to grow our business and require additional personnel to support our expanded operations, a $1.4 million increase in payment processing and billing costs due to increased customer transactions with higher billings, a $1.1 million increase in external consulting and insurance fees driven by costs incurred to comply with public company requirements, and a $0.6 million increase in bad debt expense. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also due to a $1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of expense related to RSUs with a performance condition satisfied on the effectiveness of the registration statement for our IPO.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $1.0 million, or 62%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to increased depreciation of additional leasehold improvements.\nOther Income, net\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (306\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (264\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (629\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income, net increased $0.2 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The $0.5 million increase in interest income is primarily due to the investment of cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds arising from our increased cash from operations and the funds raised in our IPO. The $0.3 million decrease in other income (expense) is primarily due to losses on foreign currency transactions, primarily a result of the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for income taxes increased $0.2 million, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, we recorded a tax provision on earnings with an effective tax rate of 16.7% compared to 27.4% in 2016. Our lower effective tax rate during 2017 is primarily the result of discrete items recorded including IPO deductible costs and higher excess tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation awards. Our lower effective tax rate during 2017 was also driven by higher R&D tax credits.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations by Segment\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,312\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,890\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,422\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of segment revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - Not Meaningful\nU.S. income from operations increased $14.1 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due to an increase in revenue of $111.6 million, offset in part by the increases in cost of revenue of $6.5 million and operating expenses of $91.0 million.\nInternational loss from operations increased $7.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in International loss from operations reflects our continued investment into international markets and expansion into new countries.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $34.9 million and $87.7 million, respectively and investments in certificates of deposit with terms of greater than 90 days but less than one year of $122.8 million and $50.0 million, respectively.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80,278\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,598\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51,992\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of foreign currency on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and\nrestricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (51,994\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,343\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operations have been financed primarily from operating activities, sales of preferred stock and our IPO. We generated cash from operating activities of $51.7 million during 2018, $25.7 million during 2017 and $20.0 million during 2016, and we expect to generate cash from operations for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the support of our product, technology, and development efforts, and the timing and extent of our investment in international markets. To the extent that existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2018 was $51.7 million, due primarily to net income of $65.2 million, adjusted for non-cash items including $20.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $5.0 million of depreciation and amortization and $3.7 of amortization of deferred contract costs due to the adoption of ASC 606, partially offset by $39.0 million of deferred taxes. Cash provided by operating activities was also attributable to a $9.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $4.5 million increase in deferred revenue and a $4.3 million increase in deferred rent, partially offset by a $13.0 million increase in deferred contract costs resulting from the adoption of ASC 606, and an $11.8 million increase prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2017 was $25.7 million, due primarily to net income of $13.2 million, non-cash items including $5.0 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3.8 million of depreciation and amortization, a $6.2 million increase in accounts payable, and a $5.2 million increase in accrued expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $7.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a $2.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2016 was $20.0 million. This was due primarily to net income of $6.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $5.8 million, primarily related to higher marketing costs, an increase in accrued expenses of $4.1 million due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, an increase of $1.9 million in deferred revenue related to customer prepayments, and an increase in deferred rent of $1.9 million related to new office space. These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in prepaid expenses primarily related to income tax payments and a $1.4 million increase in accounts receivable due to revenue growth.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment, capitalized website development costs, and short-term investments.\nCash used in investing activities of $80.3 million during 2018 was due to $212.8 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $140.0 million, $6.0 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $1.5 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nCash used in investing activities of $12.6 million during 2017 was due to $50.0 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $44.8 million, $5.2 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $2.2 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nCash used in investing activities of $52.0 million during 2016 was due to $59.8 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $15.0 million, $5.8 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $1.4 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities of $23.4 million during 2018 reflects $25.9 million of payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements of equity awards, and a $1.1 million payment of IPO costs, partially offset by $3.6 million related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities of $44.8 million during 2017 primarily reflects $44.4 million of IPO proceeds, net of offering costs and $0.4 million related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities of $0.7 million during 2016 primarily reflects $59.7 million of proceeds from the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs, and a tax benefit of $0.8 million related to the exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by $60.0 million used for the repurchase of previously issued preferred stock, common stock, vested options, and restricted stock units.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nOur lease obligations consist of various leases for office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Detroit, Michigan; and Dublin, Ireland with various lease terms through October 2033. The terms of our Massachusetts lease agreements provide for rental payments that increase on an annual basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period. We do not have any debt or material capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2018 and all of our property, equipment, and software have been purchased with cash, with the exception of $5.3 million of unpaid property and equipment costs at December 31, 2018.

We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from two primary sources: (1) marketplace subscription revenue, which consists of listing subscriptions, display advertising subscriptions with dealers and dealer search engine marketing subscriptions, and (2) advertising and other revenue, which consists primarily of display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nWe offer three types of marketplace Listing products to dealers: Basic Listing, which is free; and Enhanced or Featured Listing, which require a paid subscription under a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis. Contractual subscriptions for customers generally auto-renew on a monthly basis and are cancellable by dealers with 30-days' advance notice. We also offer Listing dealers access to the Dealer Dashboard, which includes a performance summary, Dealer Insights tool, user review management platform, Pricing Tool, and Market Analysis tool. The Pricing Tool and Market Analysis tool are available only to paying dealers. Subscription pricing is determined based on a dealer's inventory size, region, and our assessment of the connections and ROI the platform will provide them.\nCustomers do not have the right to take possession of our software.\nIn addition to listing inventory in the marketplace and providing access to the Dealer Dashboard, we offer Enhanced and Featured Listing dealers other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products, including display advertising that appears in our marketplace and on other sites on the internet. This advertising can be targeted by geography, search history, and a number of other factors, and dealer search engine marketing, which helps dealers more effectively acquire customers through paid search, social media, and retargeted advertising.\nPayment is typically due on first day of each calendar month and is recorded as accounts receivable or short-term deferred revenue when payment is received in advance of services being delivered to the customers.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nAdvertising and other revenue consists primarily of non-dealer display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers sold on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. An impression is an advertisement loaded on a web page. In addition to advertising sold on a CPM basis, we also have advertising sold on a cost per click basis. Auto manufacturers and other brand advertisers can execute advertising campaigns that are targeted across a wide variety of parameters, including demographic groups, behavioral characteristics, specific auto brands, categories such as Certified Pre-Owned, and segments such as hybrid vehicles. We do not provide minimum impression guarantees or other types of minimum guarantees in our contracts with customers. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our websites and mobile applications, and fees are billed monthly in arrears. Unbilled accounts receivables relate to services rendered in the current period, but not invoiced until the subsequent period.\nWe sell advertising directly to auto manufacturers and other auto related brand advertisers, as well as indirectly through revenue sharing arrangements with advertising exchange partners. Company-sold advertising is not subject to revenue sharing arrangements. Company-sold advertising revenue is recognized based on the gross amount charged to the advertiser. Partner-sold advertising revenue is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the content partners.\nRevenue from advertising sold directly by us is recorded on a gross basis because we are the principal in the arrangement, control the ad placement and timing of the campaign, and establish the selling price. We enter into contractual arrangements directly with advertisers and are directly responsible for the fulfillment of the contractual terms including any remedy for issues with such fulfillment.\nAdvertising revenue subject to revenue sharing agreements between us and advertising exchange partners is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the partner. The advertising partner is responsible for fulfillment, including the acceptability of the services delivered. In partner-sold advertising arrangements, the advertising partner has a direct contractual relationship with the advertiser. There is no contractual relationship between us and the advertiser for partner sold transactions. When an advertising exchange partner sells advertisements, the partner is responsible for fulfilling the advertisements, and accordingly, we have determined the advertising partner is the principal in the arrangement. Additionally, for auction-based partner agreements, we have latitude in establishing the floor price, but the final price is established by the exchange server are market rates.\nCustomers are billed monthly in arrears and payment terms are generally thirty to sixty days from the date invoiced.\nPrior to adoption of ASC 606\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.\nWe recognize marketplace subscription revenue on a monthly basis as revenue is earned and advertising and other revenue as impressions are delivered. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nWe assess arrangements with multiple deliverables under ASU No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. Pursuant to ASU 2009-13, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have stand-alone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have stand-alone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. We have concluded that each element in the arrangement has stand-alone value as the individual services can be sold separately. In addition, there is no right of refund once a service has been delivered. Therefore, we have concluded each element of the arrangement is a separate unit of accounting. While these arrangements are considered multiple element-arrangements, the recognition of the units of accounting follow a consistent ratable recognition given the pattern over which services are provided.\nWe establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our customers. Sales allowances relate primarily to credits issued for service interruption. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. Estimated sales adjustments and credits and ultimate losses may vary from actual results which could be material to the financial statements; however, to date, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates. Sales allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPost adoption of ASC 606\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which modifies how all entities recognize revenue, and consolidates revenue recognition guidance into one ASC Topic (ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers). Since we ceased to be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2018, we adopted the standard during the fourth quarter of 2018 and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2018. Under this method, we applied the revised guidance for the year of adoption and applied ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605, in the prior years. As a result, we applied ASC 606 only to contracts that were not yet completed as of January 1, 2018. We recognized a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the effective date for contracts that still required performance by us on January 1, 2018. For contracts that were modified before the effective date, we exercised the use of the practical expedient and reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating transaction price, which did not have a material effect on the adjustment to retained earnings.\nASC 606 outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps:\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> Identify the contract with a customer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2)\n</td> <td> Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 3)\n</td> <td> Determine the transaction price\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4)\n</td> <td> Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 5)\n</td> <td> Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes revenue from contracts with customers by revenue source for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue by Revenue Stream\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketplace subscription revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 405,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 454,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide disaggregation of revenue based on the marketplace subscription versus advertising and other revenue classification in the table above and based on geographic region (see Note 11) as we believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nFor dealer listings, we provide a single similar service each day for a period of time. Each time increment (i.e. day), rather than the underlying activities, is distinct and substantially the same and therefore our performance obligation is to provide a series of daily activities over the contract term. Similar to the dealer listings, the display advertising is considered a promise to provide a single similar service each day. Each time increment is distinct and substantially the same and therefore our performance obligation is to provide a series of daily activities over the contract term.\nTotal consideration for marketplace subscription revenue is stated within the contracts. There are no contractual cash refund rights, but credits may be issued to a customer at our sole discretion. At an individual contract level, there is also no variable consideration, such as sales allowance, that needs to be included in the transaction price. However, at a portfolio level, we recognize that there are times when there is a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance that will lead to a credit. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly sales allowance review is performed to defer revenue at a portfolio level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence. We establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our customers. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. Estimated sales adjustments, credits and losses may vary from actual results which could lead to material adjustments to the financial statements. To date, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates. Sales allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the service. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date our online products are made available to the customers. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nFor advertising revenue, the performance obligation is to publish the agreed upon campaign on our websites and load the related impressions.\nAdvertising contracts state the transaction price within the agreement with payment being based on the number of clicks or impressions delivered on our websites. Total consideration is based on output and deemed variable consideration constrained by an agreed upon delivery schedule. Additionally, there are generally no contractual cash refund rights. Certain contracts do contain the right for credits in situations in which impressions are not displayed in compliance with contractual specifications. At an individual contract level, we may give a credit for a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly review is performed to defer revenue at an individual contract level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence.\nAs consideration is driven by the number of impressions delivered on the CarGurus websites, the consideration for each period is allocated to the period in which the service was rendered.\nPerformance obligations for company-sold advertising revenue and partner-sold advertising revenue are satisfied over time as impressions are delivered. Revenue is recognized based on the total number of impressions delivered within the specified period. Revenue from advertising sold directly by us is recognized based on the gross amount charged to the advertiser and advertising revenue sold by partners is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the content partners. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nFor other revenue, performance obligations are satisfied over time as services are rendered and revenue is recognized as it is earned.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nWe periodically enter into arrangements that include Dealer Listing and Display within marketplace subscription revenue. These contracts include multiple promises that we evaluate to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations. Performance obligations are identified based on services to be transferred to a customer that are distinct within the context of the contractual terms. Once the performance obligations have been identified, we determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. If required, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative SSP method as the performance obligation is being satisfied. For our arrangements that include Dealer Listing and Display, the performance obligations were satisfied over a consistent period of time and therefore the allocations did not impact the revenue recognized.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nCommissions paid to sales representatives and payroll taxes are considered costs to obtain a contract. Under the new guidance, the costs to obtain a contract require capitalization and amortization of those costs over the period of benefit. Although the new guidance specifies the accounting for an individual contract with a customer, as a practical expedient, we have opted to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics. We have opted to apply another practical expedient to immediately expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract when the underlying related asset would have been amortized over one year or less. As such, we applied this practical expedient to advertising contracts as the term is one year or less and these contracts do not renew automatically. The practical expedient is not applicable to marketplace subscription contracts as the period of benefit including renewals is anticipated to be greater than one year as commissions paid on contract renewals are not commensurate with the commissions paid on the initial contract. The assets are periodically assessed for impairment.\nFor marketplace subscription customers, the commissions paid on contracts with new customers, in addition to any commission amount related to incremental sales, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated benefit period of the customer relationship taking into account factors such as peer estimates of technology lives and customer lives as well as our own historical data. Commissions paid that are not directly related to obtaining a new contract are expensed as incurred.\nAdditionally, we allocate employer payroll tax expense to the commission expense in proportion to the overall payroll taxes paid during the respective period. As such, capitalized payroll taxes are amortized in the same manner as the underlying capitalized commissions.\nCapitalized Website and Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with the development of our websites and internal-use software products after the preliminary project stage is complete and until the software is ready for its intended use. Research and development costs incurred during the preliminary project stage or costs incurred for data conversion activities, training, maintenance, and general and administrative or overhead costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits to the funding of the software project with the required authority, it is probable the project will be completed, the software will be used to perform the functions intended and certain functional and quality standards have been met. Qualified costs incurred during the operating stage of our software applications relating to upgrades and enhancements are capitalized to the extent it is probable that they will result in added functionality, while costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of, and minor upgrades and enhancements to, internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized website and software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three years beginning with the time when it is ready for intended use. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized $2.0 million and $2.2 million of website development costs, respectively. We recorded amortization expense associated with our capitalized website development costs of $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. In addition, this method requires a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by prescribing a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Interest and penalties, if applicable, related to uncertain tax positions would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. We have no recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation for stock-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, based on the estimated fair value of the awards. Through the period ended December 31, 2016, we applied an estimated forfeiture rate in determining the total stock-based compensation expense to record for the period. On January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09 and elected to account for forfeitures when they occur, on a modified retrospective basis. The cumulative effect adjustment related to this accounting policy change for forfeitures was not material. We recognize compensation expense for service-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date.\nFor RSUs issued under our stock-based compensation plans, the fair value of each grant is calculated based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of most stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Certain stock option awards that have an exercise price that is materially above the current estimated fair market value of our common stock are considered to be deeply out of the money,\u201d and are valued at the date of grant using a binomial lattice option-pricing model. The fair value of each option grant issued under our stock-based compensation plans that is not considered deeply out of the money\u201d was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nRSUs granted prior to our IPO were subject to both a service-based vesting and a performance-based vesting condition achieved upon a liquidity event, defined as either a change of control or an initial public offering of our common stock. Prior to October 11, 2017, we had not recognized compensation cost related to stock-based awards with these performance conditions as the liquidity event had not occurred. The Securities and Exchange Commission's declaration of effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on October 11, 2017 satisfied the liquidity event performance condition. The cumulative unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards was $2.5 million through October 11, 2017.\nWe determined the assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, our stock was not publicly traded, and therefore we estimated the fair value of our common stock through obtaining contemporaneous third-party valuations. Subsequent to the IPO, we determine the fair value of our common stock based on the closing share price on the date of grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term of stock options granted has been determined using the simplified method, which uses the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury constant maturity notes with terms approximately equal to the stock-based award's expected term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. Because we did not have a trading history of our common stock prior to our IPO, the expected volatility was derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Dividend Rate. The expected dividend is zero as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.\nNo options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The weighted average fair values of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.90. The weighted average assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of options granted are presented in the following table:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.57\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and our performance and future success, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. In this discussion, we use financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These rules regarding non-GAAP financial measures require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from or in substitution for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\nCompany Overview\nCarGurus is a global, online automotive marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of new and used cars. Using proprietary technology, search algorithms, and innovative data analytics, we provide information and analysis that create a differentiated automotive search experience for consumers. Our trusted marketplace empowers users with unbiased third-party validation on pricing and dealer reputation as well as other information that aids them in finding Great Deals from Top-Rated Dealers.\u201d In addition to the United States, we operate online marketplaces in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\nWe generate marketplace subscription revenue from dealers through Listing and Dealer Display subscriptions, and advertising revenue from automobile manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers. We generated revenue of $454.1 million in 2018, $316.9 million in 2017, and $198.1 million in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 43% in 2018 and 60% in 2017.\nIn 2018, we generated net income of $65.2 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $49.0 million, compared to a net income of $13.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $24.1 million in 2017, and a net income of $6.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $11.0 million in 2016. See Selected Consolidated Financial Data - Adjusted EBITDA\u201d for more information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income.\nWe have two reportable segments, United States and International. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics listed below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make operating and strategic decisions. We believe it is important to evaluate these metrics for the United States and International segments. The International segment derives revenues from marketplace subscriptions, advertising services, and other revenues from customers outside of the United States. International markets perform differently from the United States market due to a variety of factors, including our operating history in the market, our rate of investment, market size, market maturity, and other dynamics unique to each country.\nMonthly Unique Users\nFor each of our websites, we define a monthly unique user as an individual who visited such website within a calendar month, based on data as measured by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of the monthly unique users in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique device identifier accesses one of our websites during a calendar month. If an individual accesses one of our websites using a different device within a given month, the first access by each such device is counted as a separate unique user. We view our average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the quality of our user experience, the effectiveness of our advertising and traffic acquisition, and the strength of our brand awareness. Measuring unique users is important to us because our marketplace subscription revenue depends, in part, on our ability to provide dealers with connections to our users and exposure to our marketplace audience. We define connections as interactions between consumers and dealers on our marketplace through phone calls, email, managed text and chat, and clicks to access the dealer's website or map directions to the dealership.\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Monthly Unique Users\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMonthly Sessions\nWe define monthly sessions as the number of distinct visits to our websites that take place each month within a given time frame, as measured and defined by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly sessions as the sum of the monthly sessions in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. A session is defined as beginning with the first page view from a computer or mobile device and ending at the earliest of when a user closes their browser window, after 30 minutes of inactivity, or at midnight Eastern Time each night. A session can be made up of multiple page views and visitor actions, such as performing a search, visiting vehicle detail pages, and connecting with a dealer. We believe the volume of sessions in a time period, when considered in conjunction with the number of unique users in that time period, is an indicator of consumer satisfaction and engagement with our marketplace.\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Monthly Sessions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNumber of Paying Dealers\nA paying dealer is a dealer, based on a distinct associated inventory feed, that subscribes to our Enhanced or Featured Listing product at the end of a defined period. We believe that the number of paying dealers is indicative of the value proposition of our Listing products, and our sales and marketing success, including our ability to retain paying dealers and develop new dealer relationships.\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of Paying Dealers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Annual Revenue per Subscribing Dealer (AARSD)\nWe measure the average annual revenue we receive from each paying dealer. We define AARSD, which is measured at the end of a defined period, as the total marketplace subscription revenue during the trailing 12 months divided by the average number of paying dealers during the same trailing 12-month period. We believe that our ability to grow AARSD is an indicator of the value proposition of our products and the return on investment, or ROI, our paying dealers realize from our products. Increases in AARSD, which we believe reflect the value of exposure to our engaged audience in relation to subscription cost, are driven by our ability to grow the volume of connections to our users and the quality of those connections, which result in increased opportunity to upsell package levels and cross-sell additional products to our paying dealers.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Annual Revenue per Subscribing Dealer (AARSD)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other (income) expense, net, the (benefit from) provision for income taxes, and certain one-time, non-recurring items, if and when applicable. We monitor and have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a non-GAAP financial measure to supplement the financial information we present on a GAAP basis to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA, as a non-GAAP financial measure, should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We consider, and you should consider, Adjusted EBITDA together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP measure may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a key indicator of our operating results. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this measure and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, please see Selected Consolidated Financial Data - Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\nComponents of Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from two primary sources: (i) marketplace subscription revenue and (ii) advertising and other revenue, as described below.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nWe offer three types of marketplace Listing products to dealers: Basic Listing, which is free; and Enhanced or Featured Listing, which require a paid subscription under a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis. Contractual subscriptions for customers generally auto-renew on a monthly basis and are cancellable by dealers with 30-days' advance notice. We also offer Listing dealers access to the Dealer Dashboard, which includes a performance summary, Dealer Insights tool, user review management platform, Pricing Tool, and Market Analysis tool. The Pricing Tool and Market Analysis tool are available only to paying dealers.\nIn addition to listing inventory in the marketplace and providing access to the Dealer Dashboard, we offer Enhanced and Featured Listing dealers other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products, including display advertising that appears in our marketplace and on other sites on the internet. This advertising can be targeted by geography, search history, and a number of other factors, and dealer search engine marketing, which helps dealers more effectively acquire customers through paid search, social media, and retargeted advertising.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nAdvertising and other revenue consists primarily of non-dealer display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers sold on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. An impression is an advertisement loaded on a web page. In addition to advertising sold on a CPM basis, we also have advertising sold on a cost per click basis. Auto manufacturers and other brand advertisers can execute advertising campaigns that are targeted across a wide variety of parameters, including demographic groups, behavioral characteristics, specific auto brands, categories such as Certified Pre-Owned, and segments such as hybrid vehicles.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see - Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates.\u201d\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to supporting and hosting our product offerings. These costs include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation expense related to the customer support team and third-party service provider costs such as data center and networking expenses, allocated overhead, depreciation and amortization expense associated with our property and equipment, and amortization of capitalized website development costs. We allocate overhead costs, such as rent and facility costs, information technology costs, and employee benefit costs, to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category. We expect these expenses to increase as we continue to scale our business and introduce new products.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, commissions, stock-based compensation expense, and travel costs; costs associated with consumer marketing, such as traffic acquisition, brand building, and public relations activities; costs associated with dealer marketing, such as content marketing, customer and promotional events, and industry events; and allocated overhead. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we grow our audience and attempt to strengthen our brand awareness and, as informed by trends in our business and the competitive landscape of our market, fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which will impact our quarterly results of operations.\nProduct, Technology, and Development\nProduct, technology, and development expenses, which include research and development costs, consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including payroll, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. Other than website development costs and other costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect product, technology, and development expenses to increase as we develop new products and make improvements to our existing platform.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation expense, in addition to the costs associated with professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, insurance premiums, payment processing and billing costs, and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including legal, audit, and consulting fees.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on property and equipment and leasehold improvements.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, interest expense on lease obligations, and net foreign exchange gains and losses.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have recognized a benefit from income taxes for the period ended December 31, 2018 as a result of stock-based compensation benefits recorded. We have recorded a provision for income taxes for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as a result of our consolidated taxable income position. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. We regularly assess the need to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have not provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.

Marketplace subscription revenue increased by 44% while advertising and other revenue grew by 41%.\nMarketplace subscription revenue increased $123.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and represented 89% of total revenue in both 2018 and 2017. This increase in marketplace subscription revenue was attributable primarily to a 14% growth in the number of United States and International paying dealers, to 31,472 as of December 31, 2018 from 27,670 as of December 31, 2017, and to a 23% growth in our AARSD for United States dealers to $14,819 as of December 31, 2018 from $12,055 as of December 31, 2017. The increase in paying dealers was driven by the efforts of our sales and marketing teams to subscribe dealers to our Enhanced and Featured Listing paid products. The increase in our AARSD for United States dealers was driven by the investments made in building our brand and growing our audience which resulted in growth in volume of connections.\nAdvertising and other revenue increased $14.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and represented 11% of total revenue in 2018 and 2017. The increase in advertising and other revenue was due primarily to a 70% increase in the number of impressions, which was partially offset by a 17% decrease in the average price per thousand impressions, in 2018 compared to 2017.\nRevenue by Segment\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 437,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 307,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 454,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 316,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 137,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnited States revenue increased $129.7 million, or 42%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to a 10% increase in the number of United States paying dealers and a 23% increase in AARSD for United States dealers.\nInternational revenue increased $7.5 million, or 80%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to a 55% increase in the number of International paying dealers.

The increase was also partially offset by a reduction in other advertising revenue.\nRevenue by Segment\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 307,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 195,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 316,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. revenue increased $111.6 million, or 57%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to a 23% increase in the number of U.S. paying dealers and a 16% increase in AARSD for U.S. dealers.\nInternational revenue increased $7.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an increase in the number of International paying dealers.

These increases were partially offset by a $7.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a $2.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2016 was $20.0 million. This was due primarily to net income of $6.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $5.8 million, primarily related to higher marketing costs, an increase in accrued expenses of $4.1 million due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, an increase of $1.9 million in deferred revenue related to customer prepayments, and an increase in deferred rent of $1.9 million related to new office space. These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in prepaid expenses primarily related to income tax payments and a $1.4 million increase in accounts receivable due to revenue growth.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment, capitalized website development costs, and short-term investments.\nCash used in investing activities of $80.3 million during 2018 was due to $212.8 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $140.0 million, $6.0 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $1.5 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nCash used in investing activities of $12.6 million during 2017 was due to $50.0 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $44.8 million, $5.2 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $2.2 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nCash used in investing activities of $52.0 million during 2016 was due to $59.8 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $15.0 million, $5.8 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $1.4 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities of $23.4 million during 2018 reflects $25.9 million of payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements of equity awards, and a $1.1 million payment of IPO costs, partially offset by $3.6 million related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities of $44.8 million during 2017 primarily reflects $44.4 million of IPO proceeds, net of offering costs and $0.4 million related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities of $0.7 million during 2016 primarily reflects $59.7 million of proceeds from the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs, and a tax benefit of $0.8 million related to the exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by $60.0 million used for the repurchase of previously issued preferred stock, common stock, vested options, and restricted stock units.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nOur lease obligations consist of various leases for office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Detroit, Michigan; and Dublin, Ireland with various lease terms through October 2033. The terms of our Massachusetts lease agreements provide for rental payments that increase on an annual basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period. We do not have any debt or material capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2018 and all of our property, equipment, and software have been purchased with cash, with the exception of $5.3 million of unpaid property and equipment costs at December 31, 2018. We have no material long-term purchase obligations outstanding with any vendors or third parties.\nSet forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 that are fixed and determinable.\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\u00ad3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3\u00ad5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs further described in Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on January 8, 2019 we completed an acquisition pursuant to which we paid an aggregate of 15.0 million GBP, or approximately $19.1 million, which amount is inclusive of 1.0 million GBP, or approximately $1.3 million, that will be held in escrow to secure post-closing claims.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from two primary sources: (1) marketplace subscription revenue, which consists of listing subscriptions, display advertising subscriptions with dealers and dealer search engine marketing subscriptions, and (2) advertising and other revenue, which consists primarily of display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nWe offer three types of marketplace Listing products to dealers: Basic Listing, which is free; and Enhanced or Featured Listing, which require a paid subscription under a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis. Contractual subscriptions for customers generally auto-renew on a monthly basis and are cancellable by dealers with 30-days' advance notice. We also offer Listing dealers access to the Dealer Dashboard, which includes a performance summary, Dealer Insights tool, user review management platform, Pricing Tool, and Market Analysis tool. The Pricing Tool and Market Analysis tool are available only to paying dealers. Subscription pricing is determined based on a dealer's inventory size, region, and our assessment of the connections and ROI the platform will provide them.\nCustomers do not have the right to take possession of our software.\nIn addition to listing inventory in the marketplace and providing access to the Dealer Dashboard, we offer Enhanced and Featured Listing dealers other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products, including display advertising that appears in our marketplace and on other sites on the internet. This advertising can be targeted by geography, search history, and a number of other factors, and dealer search engine marketing, which helps dealers more effectively acquire customers through paid search, social media, and retargeted advertising.\nPayment is typically due on first day of each calendar month and is recorded as accounts receivable or short-term deferred revenue when payment is received in advance of services being delivered to the customers.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nAdvertising and other revenue consists primarily of non-dealer display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers sold on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. An impression is an advertisement loaded on a web page. In addition to advertising sold on a CPM basis, we also have advertising sold on a cost per click basis. Auto manufacturers and other brand advertisers can execute advertising campaigns that are targeted across a wide variety of parameters, including demographic groups, behavioral characteristics, specific auto brands, categories such as Certified Pre-Owned, and segments such as hybrid vehicles. We do not provide minimum impression guarantees or other types of minimum guarantees in our contracts with customers. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our websites and mobile applications, and fees are billed monthly in arrears. Unbilled accounts receivables relate to services rendered in the current period, but not invoiced until the subsequent period.\nWe sell advertising directly to auto manufacturers and other auto related brand advertisers, as well as indirectly through revenue sharing arrangements with advertising exchange partners. Company-sold advertising is not subject to revenue sharing arrangements. Company-sold advertising revenue is recognized based on the gross amount charged to the advertiser. Partner-sold advertising revenue is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the content partners.\nRevenue from advertising sold directly by us is recorded on a gross basis because we are the principal in the arrangement, control the ad placement and timing of the campaign, and establish the selling price. We enter into contractual arrangements directly with advertisers and are directly responsible for the fulfillment of the contractual terms including any remedy for issues with such fulfillment.\nAdvertising revenue subject to revenue sharing agreements between us and advertising exchange partners is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the partner. The advertising partner is responsible for fulfillment, including the acceptability of the services delivered. In partner-sold advertising arrangements, the advertising partner has a direct contractual relationship with the advertiser. There is no contractual relationship between us and the advertiser for partner sold transactions. When an advertising exchange partner sells advertisements, the partner is responsible for fulfilling the advertisements, and accordingly, we have determined the advertising partner is the principal in the arrangement. Additionally, for auction-based partner agreements, we have latitude in establishing the floor price, but the final price is established by the exchange server are market rates.\nCustomers are billed monthly in arrears and payment terms are generally thirty to sixty days from the date invoiced.\nPrior to adoption of ASC 606\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.\nWe recognize marketplace subscription revenue on a monthly basis as revenue is earned and advertising and other revenue as impressions are delivered. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nWe assess arrangements with multiple deliverables under ASU No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. Pursuant to ASU 2009-13, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have stand-alone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have stand-alone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. We have concluded that each element in the arrangement has stand-alone value as the individual services can be sold separately. In addition, there is no right of refund once a service has been delivered. Therefore, we have concluded each element of the arrangement is a separate unit of accounting. While these arrangements are considered multiple element-arrangements, the recognition of the units of accounting follow a consistent ratable recognition given the pattern over which services are provided.\nWe establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our customers. Sales allowances relate primarily to credits issued for service interruption. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. Estimated sales adjustments and credits and ultimate losses may vary from actual results which could be material to the financial statements; however, to date, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates. Sales allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPost adoption of ASC 606\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which modifies how all entities recognize revenue, and consolidates revenue recognition guidance into one ASC Topic (ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers). Since we ceased to be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2018, we adopted the standard during the fourth quarter of 2018 and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2018. Under this method, we applied the revised guidance for the year of adoption and applied ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605, in the prior years. As a result, we applied ASC 606 only to contracts that were not yet completed as of January 1, 2018. We recognized a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the effective date for contracts that still required performance by us on January 1, 2018. For contracts that were modified before the effective date, we exercised the use of the practical expedient and reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating transaction price, which did not have a material effect on the adjustment to retained earnings.\nASC 606 outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps:\n 1) Identify the contract with a customer \n 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract \n 3) Determine the transaction price \n 4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract \n 5) Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation \nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes revenue from contracts with customers by revenue source for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue by Revenue Stream\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketplace subscription revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 405,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 454,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide disaggregation of revenue based on the marketplace subscription versus advertising and other revenue classification in the table above and based on geographic region (see Note 11) as we believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nFor dealer listings, we provide a single similar service each day for a period of time. Each time increment (i.e. day), rather than the underlying activities, is distinct and substantially the same and therefore our performance obligation is to provide a series of daily activities over the contract term. Similar to the dealer listings, the display advertising is considered a promise to provide a single similar service each day. Each time increment is distinct and substantially the same and therefore our performance obligation is to provide a series of daily activities over the contract term.\nTotal consideration for marketplace subscription revenue is stated within the contracts. There are no contractual cash refund rights, but credits may be issued to a customer at our sole discretion. At an individual contract level, there is also no variable consideration, such as sales allowance, that needs to be included in the transaction price. However, at a portfolio level, we recognize that there are times when there is a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance that will lead to a credit. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly sales allowance review is performed to defer revenue at a portfolio level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence. We establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our customers. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. Estimated sales adjustments, credits and losses may vary from actual results which could lead to material adjustments to the financial statements. To date, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates. Sales allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the service. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date our online products are made available to the customers. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nFor advertising revenue, the performance obligation is to publish the agreed upon campaign on our websites and load the related impressions.\nAdvertising contracts state the transaction price within the agreement with payment being based on the number of clicks or impressions delivered on our websites. Total consideration is based on output and deemed variable consideration constrained by an agreed upon delivery schedule. Additionally, there are generally no contractual cash refund rights. Certain contracts do contain the right for credits in situations in which impressions are not displayed in compliance with contractual specifications. At an individual contract level, we may give a credit for a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly review is performed to defer revenue at an individual contract level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence.\nAs consideration is driven by the number of impressions delivered on the CarGurus websites, the consideration for each period is allocated to the period in which the service was rendered.\nPerformance obligations for company-sold advertising revenue and partner-sold advertising revenue are satisfied over time as impressions are delivered. Revenue is recognized based on the total number of impressions delivered within the specified period. Revenue from advertising sold directly by us is recognized based on the gross amount charged to the advertiser and advertising revenue sold by partners is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the content partners. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nFor other revenue, performance obligations are satisfied over time as services are rendered and revenue is recognized as it is earned.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nWe periodically enter into arrangements that include Dealer Listing and Display within marketplace subscription revenue. These contracts include multiple promises that we evaluate to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations. Performance obligations are identified based on services to be transferred to a customer that are distinct within the context of the contractual terms. Once the performance obligations have been identified, we determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. If required, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative SSP method as the performance obligation is being satisfied. For our arrangements that include Dealer Listing and Display, the performance obligations were satisfied over a consistent period of time and therefore the allocations did not impact the revenue recognized.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nCommissions paid to sales representatives and payroll taxes are considered costs to obtain a contract. Under the new guidance, the costs to obtain a contract require capitalization and amortization of those costs over the period of benefit. Although the new guidance specifies the accounting for an individual contract with a customer, as a practical expedient, we have opted to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics. We have opted to apply another practical expedient to immediately expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract when the underlying related asset would have been amortized over one year or less. As such, we applied this practical expedient to advertising contracts as the term is one year or less and these contracts do not renew automatically. The practical expedient is not applicable to marketplace subscription contracts as the period of benefit including renewals is anticipated to be greater than one year as commissions paid on contract renewals are not commensurate with the commissions paid on the initial contract. The assets are periodically assessed for impairment.\nFor marketplace subscription customers, the commissions paid on contracts with new customers, in addition to any commission amount related to incremental sales, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated benefit period of the customer relationship taking into account factors such as peer estimates of technology lives and customer lives as well as our own historical data. Commissions paid that are not directly related to obtaining a new contract are expensed as incurred.\nAdditionally, we allocate employer payroll tax expense to the commission expense in proportion to the overall payroll taxes paid during the respective period. As such, capitalized payroll taxes are amortized in the same manner as the underlying capitalized commissions.\nCapitalized Website and Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with the development of our websites and internal-use software products after the preliminary project stage is complete and until the software is ready for its intended use. Research and development costs incurred during the preliminary project stage or costs incurred for data conversion activities, training, maintenance, and general and administrative or overhead costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits to the funding of the software project with the required authority, it is probable the project will be completed, the software will be used to perform the functions intended and certain functional and quality standards have been met. Qualified costs incurred during the operating stage of our software applications relating to upgrades and enhancements are capitalized to the extent it is probable that they will result in added functionality, while costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of, and minor upgrades and enhancements to, internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized website and software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three years beginning with the time when it is ready for intended use. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized $2.0 million and $2.2 million of website development costs, respectively. We recorded amortization expense associated with our capitalized website development costs of $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. In addition, this method requires a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by prescribing a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Interest and penalties, if applicable, related to uncertain tax positions would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. We have no recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation for stock-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, based on the estimated fair value of the awards. Through the period ended December 31, 2016, we applied an estimated forfeiture rate in determining the total stock-based compensation expense to record for the period. On January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09 and elected to account for forfeitures when they occur, on a modified retrospective basis. The cumulative effect adjustment related to this accounting policy change for forfeitures was not material. We recognize compensation expense for service-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date.\nFor RSUs issued under our stock-based compensation plans, the fair value of each grant is calculated based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of most stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Certain stock option awards that have an exercise price that is materially above the current estimated fair market value of our common stock are considered to be deeply out of the money,\u201d and are valued at the date of grant using a binomial lattice option-pricing model. The fair value of each option grant issued under our stock-based compensation plans that is not considered deeply out of the money\u201d was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nRSUs granted prior to our IPO were subject to both a service-based vesting and a performance-based vesting condition achieved upon a liquidity event, defined as either a change of control or an initial public offering of our common stock. Prior to October 11, 2017, we had not recognized compensation cost related to stock-based awards with these performance conditions as the liquidity event had not occurred. The Securities and Exchange Commission's declaration of effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on October 11, 2017 satisfied the liquidity event performance condition. The cumulative unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards was $2.5 million through October 11, 2017.\nWe determined the assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.\n \u2022 Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, our stock was not publicly traded, and therefore we estimated the fair value of our common stock through obtaining contemporaneous third-party valuations. Subsequent to the IPO, we determine the fair value of our common stock based on the closing share price on the date of grant. \n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term of stock options granted has been determined using the simplified method, which uses the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual term. \n \u2022 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury constant maturity notes with terms approximately equal to the stock-based award's expected term. \n \u2022 Expected Volatility. Because we did not have a trading history of our common stock prior to our IPO, the expected volatility was derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards. \n \u2022 Dividend Rate. The expected dividend is zero as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. \nIf any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.\nNo options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The weighted average fair values of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.90. The weighted average assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of options granted are presented in the following table:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.57\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
    "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and our performance and future success, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. In this discussion, we use financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These rules regarding non-GAAP financial measures require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from or in substitution for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\nCompany Overview\nCarGurus is a global, online automotive marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of new and used cars. Using proprietary technology, search algorithms, and innovative data analytics, we provide information and analysis that create a differentiated automotive search experience for consumers. Our trusted marketplace empowers users with unbiased third-party validation on pricing and dealer reputation as well as other information that aids them in finding Great Deals from Top-Rated Dealers.\u201d In addition to the United States, we operate online marketplaces in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\nWe generate marketplace subscription revenue from dealers through Listing and Dealer Display subscriptions, and advertising revenue from automobile manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers. We generated revenue of $454.1 million in 2018, $316.9 million in 2017, and $198.1 million in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 43% in 2018 and 60% in 2017.\nIn 2018, we generated net income of $65.2 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $49.0 million, compared to a net income of $13.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $24.1 million in 2017, and a net income of $6.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $11.0 million in 2016. See Selected Consolidated Financial Data - Adjusted EBITDA\u201d for more information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income.\nWe have two reportable segments, United States and International. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics listed below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make operating and strategic decisions. We believe it is important to evaluate these metrics for the United States and International segments. The International segment derives revenues from marketplace subscriptions, advertising services, and other revenues from customers outside of the United States. International markets perform differently from the United States market due to a variety of factors, including our operating history in the market, our rate of investment, market size, market maturity, and other dynamics unique to each country.\nMonthly Unique Users\nFor each of our websites, we define a monthly unique user as an individual who visited such website within a calendar month, based on data as measured by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of the monthly unique users in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique device identifier accesses one of our websites during a calendar month. If an individual accesses one of our websites using a different device within a given month, the first access by each such device is counted as a separate unique user. We view our average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the quality of our user experience, the effectiveness of our advertising and traffic acquisition, and the strength of our brand awareness. Measuring unique users is important to us because our marketplace subscription revenue depends, in part, on our ability to provide dealers with connections to our users and exposure to our marketplace audience. We define connections as interactions between consumers and dealers on our marketplace through phone calls, email, managed text and chat, and clicks to access the dealer's website or map directions to the dealership.\n\nMonthly Sessions\nWe define monthly sessions as the number of distinct visits to our websites that take place each month within a given time frame, as measured and defined by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly sessions as the sum of the monthly sessions in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. A session is defined as beginning with the first page view from a computer or mobile device and ending at the earliest of when a user closes their browser window, after 30 minutes of inactivity, or at midnight Eastern Time each night. A session can be made up of multiple page views and visitor actions, such as performing a search, visiting vehicle detail pages, and connecting with a dealer. We believe the volume of sessions in a time period, when considered in conjunction with the number of unique users in that time period, is an indicator of consumer satisfaction and engagement with our marketplace.\n\nNumber of Paying Dealers\nA paying dealer is a dealer, based on a distinct associated inventory feed, that subscribes to our Enhanced or Featured Listing product at the end of a defined period. We believe that the number of paying dealers is indicative of the value proposition of our Listing products, and our sales and marketing success, including our ability to retain paying dealers and develop new dealer relationships.\n\nAverage Annual Revenue per Subscribing Dealer (AARSD)\nWe measure the average annual revenue we receive from each paying dealer. We define AARSD, which is measured at the end of a defined period, as the total marketplace subscription revenue during the trailing 12 months divided by the average number of paying dealers during the same trailing 12-month period. We believe that our ability to grow AARSD is an indicator of the value proposition of our products and the return on investment, or ROI, our paying dealers realize from our products. Increases in AARSD, which we believe reflect the value of exposure to our engaged audience in relation to subscription cost, are driven by our ability to grow the volume of connections to our users and the quality of those connections, which result in increased opportunity to upsell package levels and cross-sell additional products to our paying dealers.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other (income) expense, net, the (benefit from) provision for income taxes, and certain one-time, non-recurring items, if and when applicable. We monitor and have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a non-GAAP financial measure to supplement the financial information we present on a GAAP basis to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA, as a non-GAAP financial measure, should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We consider, and you should consider, Adjusted EBITDA together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP measure may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a key indicator of our operating results. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this measure and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, please see Selected Consolidated Financial Data - Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\nComponents of Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from two primary sources: (i) marketplace subscription revenue and (ii) advertising and other revenue, as described below.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nWe offer three types of marketplace Listing products to dealers: Basic Listing, which is free; and Enhanced or Featured Listing, which require a paid subscription under a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis. Contractual subscriptions for customers generally auto-renew on a monthly basis and are cancellable by dealers with 30-days' advance notice. We also offer Listing dealers access to the Dealer Dashboard, which includes a performance summary, Dealer Insights tool, user review management platform, Pricing Tool, and Market Analysis tool. The Pricing Tool and Market Analysis tool are available only to paying dealers.\nIn addition to listing inventory in the marketplace and providing access to the Dealer Dashboard, we offer Enhanced and Featured Listing dealers other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products, including display advertising that appears in our marketplace and on other sites on the internet. This advertising can be targeted by geography, search history, and a number of other factors, and dealer search engine marketing, which helps dealers more effectively acquire customers through paid search, social media, and retargeted advertising.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nAdvertising and other revenue consists primarily of non-dealer display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers sold on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. An impression is an advertisement loaded on a web page. In addition to advertising sold on a CPM basis, we also have advertising sold on a cost per click basis. Auto manufacturers and other brand advertisers can execute advertising campaigns that are targeted across a wide variety of parameters, including demographic groups, behavioral characteristics, specific auto brands, categories such as Certified Pre-Owned, and segments such as hybrid vehicles.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see - Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates.\u201d\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to supporting and hosting our product offerings. These costs include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation expense related to the customer support team and third-party service provider costs such as data center and networking expenses, allocated overhead, depreciation and amortization expense associated with our property and equipment, and amortization of capitalized website development costs. We allocate overhead costs, such as rent and facility costs, information technology costs, and employee benefit costs, to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category. We expect these expenses to increase as we continue to scale our business and introduce new products.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, commissions, stock-based compensation expense, and travel costs; costs associated with consumer marketing, such as traffic acquisition, brand building, and public relations activities; costs associated with dealer marketing, such as content marketing, customer and promotional events, and industry events; and allocated overhead. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we grow our audience and attempt to strengthen our brand awareness and, as informed by trends in our business and the competitive landscape of our market, fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which will impact our quarterly results of operations.\nProduct, Technology, and Development\nProduct, technology, and development expenses, which include research and development costs, consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including payroll, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. Other than website development costs and other costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect product, technology, and development expenses to increase as we develop new products and make improvements to our existing platform.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation expense, in addition to the costs associated with professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, insurance premiums, payment processing and billing costs, and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including legal, audit, and consulting fees.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on property and equipment and leasehold improvements.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, interest expense on lease obligations, and net foreign exchange gains and losses.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have recognized a benefit from income taxes for the period ended December 31, 2018 as a result of stock-based compensation benefits recorded. We have recorded a provision for income taxes for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as a result of our consolidated taxable income position. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. We regularly assess the need to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have not provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\n \n\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated.\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue by Source\n\nOverall revenue increased $137.2 million, or 43%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Marketplace subscription revenue increased by 44% while advertising and other revenue grew by 41%.\nMarketplace subscription revenue increased $123.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and represented 89% of total revenue in both 2018 and 2017. This increase in marketplace subscription revenue was attributable primarily to a 14% growth in the number of United States and International paying dealers, to 31,472 as of December 31, 2018 from 27,670 as of December 31, 2017, and to a 23% growth in our AARSD for United States dealers to $14,819 as of December 31, 2018 from $12,055 as of December 31, 2017. The increase in paying dealers was driven by the efforts of our sales and marketing teams to subscribe dealers to our Enhanced and Featured Listing paid products. The increase in our AARSD for United States dealers was driven by the investments made in building our brand and growing our audience which resulted in growth in volume of connections.\nAdvertising and other revenue increased $14.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, and represented 11% of total revenue in 2018 and 2017. The increase in advertising and other revenue was due primarily to a 70% increase in the number of impressions, which was partially offset by a 17% decrease in the average price per thousand impressions, in 2018 compared to 2017.\nRevenue by Segment\n\nUnited States revenue increased $129.7 million, or 42%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to a 10% increase in the number of United States paying dealers and a 23% increase in AARSD for United States dealers.\nInternational revenue increased $7.5 million, or 80%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to a 55% increase in the number of International paying dealers. International paying dealers grew to 3,938 at December 31, 2018 from 2,548 at December 31, 2017.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue increased $7.2 million, or 41%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to a $2.7 million increase in costs related to connecting consumers with dealers through a variety of methods, including phone calls, email, and managed text and chat, a $1.7 million increase in fees related to provisioning advertising campaigns on our websites, a $1.4 million increase in data center and hosting costs, and a $1.2 million increase in amortization and depreciation.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $79.8 million, or 34%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to an increase in advertising costs of $65.5 million as well as an increase of $8.1 million in salaries and employee-related costs (excluding commission expense) resulting from a 25% increase in headcount and payroll taxes of $0.9 million driven by the employer portion of FICA taxes on the exercise of stock awards and vesting of restricted stock units, or RSUs. This increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was also due in part to a $3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs resulting from the increase in headcount, a $1.7 million increase in marketing events and market research due to efforts to increase brand awareness, a $0.8 million increase in rent due to a new office building in Cambridge and rent increase in Ireland, and a $0.8 million increase in software subscriptions. These increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in commission expense driven by our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProduct, Technology, and Development Expenses\n\nProduct, technology, and development expenses increased $25.4 million, or 113%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to a $13.8 million increase in salaries and employee-related costs resulting from a 59% increase in headcount and payroll taxes of $1.2 million driven by the employer portion of FICA taxes on the exercise of stock awards and vesting of RSUs. This increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was also due in part to an $8.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs resulting from the increase in headcount, $0.8 million increase in rent due to a new office building in Cambridge, a $0.5 million increase in software subscriptions and a $0.5 million increase in consulting fees.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $16.8 million, or 74%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $4.7 million of insurance, legal, consulting and external reporting fees driven by costs incurred to comply with public company requirements as well as an increase of $4.4 million in salaries and employee-related costs resulting from a 45% increase in headcount and payroll taxes of $0.3 million driven by the employer portion of FICA taxes on the exercise of stock awards and vesting of RSUs. This increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was also due in part to a $4.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs due to the increase in headcount, a $1.8 million increase in payment processing and billing costs due to increased customer transactions with higher billings resulting from revenue growth and a $0.6 million increase in bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $0.1 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Income, net\n\nOther income, net increased $1.7 million, or 307%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The $1.4 million increase in interest income is primarily due to the investment of cash in certificates of deposit, money market funds arising from our increased cash from operations, and an increase in interest rates. The $0.3 million increase in other income (expense) is primarily due the Euro strengthening against the U.S. Dollar in 2017 and remaining relatively flat in 2018.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\n\nNM - Not Meaningful\nThe benefit from income taxes recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the provision for income taxes recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to $40.8 million in stock-based compensation benefits recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits and a lower federal statutory tax rate due to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, as compared to year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations by Segment\n\nNM - Not Meaningful\nUnited States income from operations increased $16.8 million, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to an increase in revenue of $129.7 million, offset in part by the increases in cost of revenue of $6.8 million and operating expenses of $106.1 million.\nInternational loss from operations increased $8.9 million, or 34% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in International loss from operations reflects our continued investment into international markets and expansion into new countries.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue by Source\n\nOverall revenue increased $118.7 million, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Marketplace subscription revenue increased by 65% while advertising and other revenue grew by 27%.\nMarketplace subscription revenue increased $111.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, and represented 89% of total revenue in 2017 compared to 86% of total revenue in 2016. This increase in marketplace subscription revenue was attributable primarily to a 30% growth in the number of U.S. and International paying dealers, to 27,670 as of December 31, 2017 from 21,301 as of December 31, 2016, and to a 16% growth in our AARSD for U.S. dealers to $12,055 in the year ended December 31, 2017 from $10,383 in the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe that this increase in paying dealers was driven by the overall growth in the number of unique users to our websites and mobile applications and the efforts of our sales and marketing teams to subscribe dealers to our Enhanced and Featured Listing paid products.\nAdvertising and other revenue increased $7.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, and represented 11% of total revenue in 2017 compared to 14% of total revenue in 2016. The increase in advertising and other revenue was due primarily to a 16% increase in the number of impressions delivered in 2017 and a 28% increase in the average price per thousand impressions in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was also partially offset by a reduction in other advertising revenue.\nRevenue by Segment\n\nU.S. revenue increased $111.6 million, or 57%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to a 23% increase in the number of U.S. paying dealers and a 16% increase in AARSD for U.S. dealers.\nInternational revenue increased $7.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an increase in the number of International paying dealers. International paying dealers grew to 2,548 at December 31, 2017 from 952 at December 31, 2016.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue increased $8.0 million, or 84%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to a $2.4 million increase in employee-related costs for our customer support team to support the growth in customers, a $1.9 million increase in fees related to provisioning advertising campaigns on our websites, a $1.3 million increase in costs related to connecting consumers with dealers through a variety of methods, including phone calls, email, and managed text and chat, a $0.9 million increase in costs to improve the content on our websites, a $0.8 million increase for data center and hosting costs, and a $0.5 million increase in amortization of website development costs.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $82.0 million, or 53%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due primarily to an increase in advertising costs of $61.0 million, a $12.8 million increase in salaries, commissions, and related expenses due to our increased revenue and a 21% increase in headcount, a $2.0 million increase in expenses related to marketing events and activities, a $1.7 million increase in consulting fees, a $1.0 million increase in rent due to the expansion of our office space, and a $0.8 million increase in software subscriptions. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also due to a $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of expense related to RSUs with a performance condition satisfied on the effectiveness of the registration statement for our IPO. Although the performance-based vesting condition was satisfied, under the terms of the awards, the settlement of such vested RSUs and the issuance of common stock with respect to such vested RSUs will occur on April 10, 2018, one hundred eighty-one days after the satisfaction of the performance condition.\nProduct, Technology, and Development Expenses\n\nProduct, technology, and development expenses increased $11.0 million, or 96%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries and related employment expenses due to a 68% increase in headcount to support our growth and product innovations. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also due to a $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of expense related to RSUs with a performance condition satisfied on the effectiveness of the registration statement for our IPO.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $9.9 million, or 77%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily reflected an increase of $5.0 million of salaries and employee-related costs as a result of our 81% increase in headcount as we continued to grow our business and require additional personnel to support our expanded operations, a $1.4 million increase in payment processing and billing costs due to increased customer transactions with higher billings, a $1.1 million increase in external consulting and insurance fees driven by costs incurred to comply with public company requirements, and a $0.6 million increase in bad debt expense. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also due to a $1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of expense related to RSUs with a performance condition satisfied on the effectiveness of the registration statement for our IPO.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $1.0 million, or 62%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to increased depreciation of additional leasehold improvements.\nOther Income, net\n\nOther income, net increased $0.2 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The $0.5 million increase in interest income is primarily due to the investment of cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds arising from our increased cash from operations and the funds raised in our IPO. The $0.3 million decrease in other income (expense) is primarily due to losses on foreign currency transactions, primarily a result of the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes increased $0.2 million, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, we recorded a tax provision on earnings with an effective tax rate of 16.7% compared to 27.4% in 2016. Our lower effective tax rate during 2017 is primarily the result of discrete items recorded including IPO deductible costs and higher excess tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation awards. Our lower effective tax rate during 2017 was also driven by higher R&D tax credits.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations by Segment\n\nNM - Not Meaningful\nU.S. income from operations increased $14.1 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due to an increase in revenue of $111.6 million, offset in part by the increases in cost of revenue of $6.5 million and operating expenses of $91.0 million.\nInternational loss from operations increased $7.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in International loss from operations reflects our continued investment into international markets and expansion into new countries.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $34.9 million and $87.7 million, respectively and investments in certificates of deposit with terms of greater than 90 days but less than one year of $122.8 million and $50.0 million, respectively.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:\n\nOur operations have been financed primarily from operating activities, sales of preferred stock and our IPO. We generated cash from operating activities of $51.7 million during 2018, $25.7 million during 2017 and $20.0 million during 2016, and we expect to generate cash from operations for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the support of our product, technology, and development efforts, and the timing and extent of our investment in international markets. To the extent that existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2018 was $51.7 million, due primarily to net income of $65.2 million, adjusted for non-cash items including $20.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $5.0 million of depreciation and amortization and $3.7 of amortization of deferred contract costs due to the adoption of ASC 606, partially offset by $39.0 million of deferred taxes. Cash provided by operating activities was also attributable to a $9.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $4.5 million increase in deferred revenue and a $4.3 million increase in deferred rent, partially offset by a $13.0 million increase in deferred contract costs resulting from the adoption of ASC 606, and an $11.8 million increase prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2017 was $25.7 million, due primarily to net income of $13.2 million, non-cash items including $5.0 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3.8 million of depreciation and amortization, a $6.2 million increase in accounts payable, and a $5.2 million increase in accrued expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $7.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a $2.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2016 was $20.0 million. This was due primarily to net income of $6.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $5.8 million, primarily related to higher marketing costs, an increase in accrued expenses of $4.1 million due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, an increase of $1.9 million in deferred revenue related to customer prepayments, and an increase in deferred rent of $1.9 million related to new office space. These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in prepaid expenses primarily related to income tax payments and a $1.4 million increase in accounts receivable due to revenue growth.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment, capitalized website development costs, and short-term investments.\nCash used in investing activities of $80.3 million during 2018 was due to $212.8 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $140.0 million, $6.0 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $1.5 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nCash used in investing activities of $12.6 million during 2017 was due to $50.0 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $44.8 million, $5.2 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $2.2 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nCash used in investing activities of $52.0 million during 2016 was due to $59.8 million of investments in certificates of deposit, net of maturities of $15.0 million, $5.8 million of investments in furniture, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements, and $1.4 million related to the capitalization of website development costs.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities of $23.4 million during 2018 reflects $25.9 million of payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements of equity awards, and a $1.1 million payment of IPO costs, partially offset by $3.6 million related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities of $44.8 million during 2017 primarily reflects $44.4 million of IPO proceeds, net of offering costs and $0.4 million related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities of $0.7 million during 2016 primarily reflects $59.7 million of proceeds from the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs, and a tax benefit of $0.8 million related to the exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by $60.0 million used for the repurchase of previously issued preferred stock, common stock, vested options, and restricted stock units.\nContractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements\nOur lease obligations consist of various leases for office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Detroit, Michigan; and Dublin, Ireland with various lease terms through October 2033. The terms of our Massachusetts lease agreements provide for rental payments that increase on an annual basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period. We do not have any debt or material capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2018 and all of our property, equipment, and software have been purchased with cash, with the exception of $5.3 million of unpaid property and equipment costs at December 31, 2018. We have no material long-term purchase obligations outstanding with any vendors or third parties.\nSet forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 that are fixed and determinable.\n\nAs further described in Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on January 8, 2019 we completed an acquisition pursuant to which we paid an aggregate of 15.0 million GBP, or approximately $19.1 million, which amount is inclusive of 1.0 million GBP, or approximately $1.3 million, that will be held in escrow to secure post-closing claims.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from two primary sources: (1) marketplace subscription revenue, which consists of listing subscriptions, display advertising subscriptions with dealers and dealer search engine marketing subscriptions, and (2) advertising and other revenue, which consists primarily of display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nWe offer three types of marketplace Listing products to dealers: Basic Listing, which is free; and Enhanced or Featured Listing, which require a paid subscription under a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis. Contractual subscriptions for customers generally auto-renew on a monthly basis and are cancellable by dealers with 30-days' advance notice. We also offer Listing dealers access to the Dealer Dashboard, which includes a performance summary, Dealer Insights tool, user review management platform, Pricing Tool, and Market Analysis tool. The Pricing Tool and Market Analysis tool are available only to paying dealers. Subscription pricing is determined based on a dealer's inventory size, region, and our assessment of the connections and ROI the platform will provide them.\nCustomers do not have the right to take possession of our software.\nIn addition to listing inventory in the marketplace and providing access to the Dealer Dashboard, we offer Enhanced and Featured Listing dealers other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products, including display advertising that appears in our marketplace and on other sites on the internet. This advertising can be targeted by geography, search history, and a number of other factors, and dealer search engine marketing, which helps dealers more effectively acquire customers through paid search, social media, and retargeted advertising.\nPayment is typically due on first day of each calendar month and is recorded as accounts receivable or short-term deferred revenue when payment is received in advance of services being delivered to the customers.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nAdvertising and other revenue consists primarily of non-dealer display advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers sold on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. An impression is an advertisement loaded on a web page. In addition to advertising sold on a CPM basis, we also have advertising sold on a cost per click basis. Auto manufacturers and other brand advertisers can execute advertising campaigns that are targeted across a wide variety of parameters, including demographic groups, behavioral characteristics, specific auto brands, categories such as Certified Pre-Owned, and segments such as hybrid vehicles. We do not provide minimum impression guarantees or other types of minimum guarantees in our contracts with customers. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our websites and mobile applications, and fees are billed monthly in arrears. Unbilled accounts receivables relate to services rendered in the current period, but not invoiced until the subsequent period.\nWe sell advertising directly to auto manufacturers and other auto related brand advertisers, as well as indirectly through revenue sharing arrangements with advertising exchange partners. Company-sold advertising is not subject to revenue sharing arrangements. Company-sold advertising revenue is recognized based on the gross amount charged to the advertiser. Partner-sold advertising revenue is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the content partners.\nRevenue from advertising sold directly by us is recorded on a gross basis because we are the principal in the arrangement, control the ad placement and timing of the campaign, and establish the selling price. We enter into contractual arrangements directly with advertisers and are directly responsible for the fulfillment of the contractual terms including any remedy for issues with such fulfillment.\nAdvertising revenue subject to revenue sharing agreements between us and advertising exchange partners is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the partner. The advertising partner is responsible for fulfillment, including the acceptability of the services delivered. In partner-sold advertising arrangements, the advertising partner has a direct contractual relationship with the advertiser. There is no contractual relationship between us and the advertiser for partner sold transactions. When an advertising exchange partner sells advertisements, the partner is responsible for fulfilling the advertisements, and accordingly, we have determined the advertising partner is the principal in the arrangement. Additionally, for auction-based partner agreements, we have latitude in establishing the floor price, but the final price is established by the exchange server are market rates.\nCustomers are billed monthly in arrears and payment terms are generally thirty to sixty days from the date invoiced.\nPrior to adoption of ASC 606\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.\nWe recognize marketplace subscription revenue on a monthly basis as revenue is earned and advertising and other revenue as impressions are delivered. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nWe assess arrangements with multiple deliverables under ASU No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. Pursuant to ASU 2009-13, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have stand-alone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have stand-alone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. We have concluded that each element in the arrangement has stand-alone value as the individual services can be sold separately. In addition, there is no right of refund once a service has been delivered. Therefore, we have concluded each element of the arrangement is a separate unit of accounting. While these arrangements are considered multiple element-arrangements, the recognition of the units of accounting follow a consistent ratable recognition given the pattern over which services are provided.\nWe establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our customers. Sales allowances relate primarily to credits issued for service interruption. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. Estimated sales adjustments and credits and ultimate losses may vary from actual results which could be material to the financial statements; however, to date, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates. Sales allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPost adoption of ASC 606\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which modifies how all entities recognize revenue, and consolidates revenue recognition guidance into one ASC Topic (ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers). Since we ceased to be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2018, we adopted the standard during the fourth quarter of 2018 and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2018. Under this method, we applied the revised guidance for the year of adoption and applied ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605, in the prior years. As a result, we applied ASC 606 only to contracts that were not yet completed as of January 1, 2018. We recognized a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the effective date for contracts that still required performance by us on January 1, 2018. For contracts that were modified before the effective date, we exercised the use of the practical expedient and reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating transaction price, which did not have a material effect on the adjustment to retained earnings.\nASC 606 outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps:\n 1) Identify the contract with a customer \n 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract \n 3) Determine the transaction price \n 4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract \n 5) Recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation \nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes revenue from contracts with customers by revenue source for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nWe provide disaggregation of revenue based on the marketplace subscription versus advertising and other revenue classification in the table above and based on geographic region (see Note 11) as we believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nMarketplace Subscription Revenue\nFor dealer listings, we provide a single similar service each day for a period of time. Each time increment (i.e. day), rather than the underlying activities, is distinct and substantially the same and therefore our performance obligation is to provide a series of daily activities over the contract term. Similar to the dealer listings, the display advertising is considered a promise to provide a single similar service each day. Each time increment is distinct and substantially the same and therefore our performance obligation is to provide a series of daily activities over the contract term.\nTotal consideration for marketplace subscription revenue is stated within the contracts. There are no contractual cash refund rights, but credits may be issued to a customer at our sole discretion. At an individual contract level, there is also no variable consideration, such as sales allowance, that needs to be included in the transaction price. However, at a portfolio level, we recognize that there are times when there is a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance that will lead to a credit. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly sales allowance review is performed to defer revenue at a portfolio level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence. We establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our customers. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the financial statements. Estimated sales adjustments, credits and losses may vary from actual results which could lead to material adjustments to the financial statements. To date, actual sales allowances have been materially consistent with our estimates. Sales allowances are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the service. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date our online products are made available to the customers. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nAdvertising and Other Revenue\nFor advertising revenue, the performance obligation is to publish the agreed upon campaign on our websites and load the related impressions.\nAdvertising contracts state the transaction price within the agreement with payment being based on the number of clicks or impressions delivered on our websites. Total consideration is based on output and deemed variable consideration constrained by an agreed upon delivery schedule. Additionally, there are generally no contractual cash refund rights. Certain contracts do contain the right for credits in situations in which impressions are not displayed in compliance with contractual specifications. At an individual contract level, we may give a credit for a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly review is performed to defer revenue at an individual contract level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence.\nAs consideration is driven by the number of impressions delivered on the CarGurus websites, the consideration for each period is allocated to the period in which the service was rendered.\nPerformance obligations for company-sold advertising revenue and partner-sold advertising revenue are satisfied over time as impressions are delivered. Revenue is recognized based on the total number of impressions delivered within the specified period. Revenue from advertising sold directly by us is recognized based on the gross amount charged to the advertiser and advertising revenue sold by partners is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the content partners. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.\nFor other revenue, performance obligations are satisfied over time as services are rendered and revenue is recognized as it is earned.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nWe periodically enter into arrangements that include Dealer Listing and Display within marketplace subscription revenue. These contracts include multiple promises that we evaluate to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations. Performance obligations are identified based on services to be transferred to a customer that are distinct within the context of the contractual terms. Once the performance obligations have been identified, we determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. If required, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative SSP method as the performance obligation is being satisfied. For our arrangements that include Dealer Listing and Display, the performance obligations were satisfied over a consistent period of time and therefore the allocations did not impact the revenue recognized.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nCommissions paid to sales representatives and payroll taxes are considered costs to obtain a contract. Under the new guidance, the costs to obtain a contract require capitalization and amortization of those costs over the period of benefit. Although the new guidance specifies the accounting for an individual contract with a customer, as a practical expedient, we have opted to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics. We have opted to apply another practical expedient to immediately expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract when the underlying related asset would have been amortized over one year or less. As such, we applied this practical expedient to advertising contracts as the term is one year or less and these contracts do not renew automatically. The practical expedient is not applicable to marketplace subscription contracts as the period of benefit including renewals is anticipated to be greater than one year as commissions paid on contract renewals are not commensurate with the commissions paid on the initial contract. The assets are periodically assessed for impairment.\nFor marketplace subscription customers, the commissions paid on contracts with new customers, in addition to any commission amount related to incremental sales, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated benefit period of the customer relationship taking into account factors such as peer estimates of technology lives and customer lives as well as our own historical data. Commissions paid that are not directly related to obtaining a new contract are expensed as incurred.\nAdditionally, we allocate employer payroll tax expense to the commission expense in proportion to the overall payroll taxes paid during the respective period. As such, capitalized payroll taxes are amortized in the same manner as the underlying capitalized commissions.\nCapitalized Website and Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with the development of our websites and internal-use software products after the preliminary project stage is complete and until the software is ready for its intended use. Research and development costs incurred during the preliminary project stage or costs incurred for data conversion activities, training, maintenance, and general and administrative or overhead costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits to the funding of the software project with the required authority, it is probable the project will be completed, the software will be used to perform the functions intended and certain functional and quality standards have been met. Qualified costs incurred during the operating stage of our software applications relating to upgrades and enhancements are capitalized to the extent it is probable that they will result in added functionality, while costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of, and minor upgrades and enhancements to, internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized website and software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three years beginning with the time when it is ready for intended use. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized $2.0 million and $2.2 million of website development costs, respectively. We recorded amortization expense associated with our capitalized website development costs of $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. In addition, this method requires a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by prescribing a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Interest and penalties, if applicable, related to uncertain tax positions would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. We have no recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation for stock-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, based on the estimated fair value of the awards. Through the period ended December 31, 2016, we applied an estimated forfeiture rate in determining the total stock-based compensation expense to record for the period. On January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09 and elected to account for forfeitures when they occur, on a modified retrospective basis. The cumulative effect adjustment related to this accounting policy change for forfeitures was not material. We recognize compensation expense for service-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date.\nFor RSUs issued under our stock-based compensation plans, the fair value of each grant is calculated based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of most stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Certain stock option awards that have an exercise price that is materially above the current estimated fair market value of our common stock are considered to be deeply out of the money,\u201d and are valued at the date of grant using a binomial lattice option-pricing model. The fair value of each option grant issued under our stock-based compensation plans that is not considered deeply out of the money\u201d was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nRSUs granted prior to our IPO were subject to both a service-based vesting and a performance-based vesting condition achieved upon a liquidity event, defined as either a change of control or an initial public offering of our common stock. Prior to October 11, 2017, we had not recognized compensation cost related to stock-based awards with these performance conditions as the liquidity event had not occurred. The Securities and Exchange Commission's declaration of effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on October 11, 2017 satisfied the liquidity event performance condition. The cumulative unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards was $2.5 million through October 11, 2017.\nWe determined the assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.\n \u2022 Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, our stock was not publicly traded, and therefore we estimated the fair value of our common stock through obtaining contemporaneous third-party valuations. Subsequent to the IPO, we determine the fair value of our common stock based on the closing share price on the date of grant. \n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term of stock options granted has been determined using the simplified method, which uses the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual term. \n \u2022 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury constant maturity notes with terms approximately equal to the stock-based award's expected term. \n \u2022 Expected Volatility. Because we did not have a trading history of our common stock prior to our IPO, the expected volatility was derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards. \n \u2022 Dividend Rate. The expected dividend is zero as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. \nIf any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.\nNo options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The weighted average fair values of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.90. The weighted average assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of options granted are presented in the following table:\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
