MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness and Investment Strategy\nWe are a self-administered health care real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) that invests primarily in seniors housing and health care properties through sale-leaseback transactions, mortgage financing, joint ventures and structured finance solutions including mezzanine lending. We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments, for internal reporting and internal decision making purposes. Our primary objectives are to create, sustain and enhance stockholder equity value and provide current income for distribution to stockholders through real estate investments in seniors housing and health care properties managed by experienced operators. Our primary seniors housing and health care property classifications include skilled nursing centers ( SNF\u201d), assisted living communities ( ALF\u201d), independent living communities ( ILF\u201d), memory care communities ( MC\u201d) and combinations thereof. ALF, ILF, MC, and combinations thereof are included in the ALF communities classification. We have been operating since August 1992.\nSubstantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals, interest earned on outstanding loans receivable and income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. Our investments in owned properties and mortgage loans represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon the performance of the operators on their lease and loan obligations and the rates earned thereon. To the extent that the operators experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by property type and operator. Our monitoring process includes periodic review of financial statements for each facility, periodic review of operator credit, scheduled property inspections and review of covenant compliance.\nIn addition to our monitoring and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. Some operating leases and loans are credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates.\nDepending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we anticipate making additional investments in health care related properties. New investments are generally funded from cash on hand, temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving line of credit and internally generated cash flows. Our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on mortgage loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving line of credit, is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and secured and unsecured debt financing. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets' environment, especially to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets' environment may impact the availability of cost-effective capital.\nWe believe our business model has enabled and will continue to enable us to maintain the integrity of our property investments, including in response to financial difficulties that may be experienced by operators. Traditionally, we have taken a conservative approach to managing our business, choosing to maintain liquidity and exercise patience until favorable investment opportunities arise.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPortfolio Overview\nThe following tables summarizes our real estate investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 82: <table> <tr>

In most instances, our lease structure contains fixed or estimable annual rental escalations, which are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. Certain leases have annual rental escalations that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. This revenue is not recognized until the appropriate contingencies have been resolved. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received $470,000, $457,000 and $517,000, respectively, of contingent rental income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $9.6 million in straight-line rental income and recorded $0.1 million of straight-line rent receivable reserve. For the remaining leases in place at December 31, 2018, assuming no modification or replacement of existing leases and no new leased investments are added to our portfolio, except for the lease extensions and completed developments in 2019 and the lease reported below under Update on Certain Operators, we currently expect that straight-line rental income will decrease from $9.6 million in 2018 to $4.1 million for projected annual 2019. Our cash rental income is projected to increase from $127.9 million in 2018 to $133.7 million for projected annual 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrecorded $2.1 million of lease incentives. At December 31, 2018, the straight-line rent receivable balance, net of reserves, on the consolidated balance sheet was $73.9 million.\nMany of our existing leases contain renewal options that, if exercised, could result in the amount of rent payable upon renewal being greater or less than that currently being paid. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two existing leases were amended to extend the term of the master lease. The first amendment extended the master lease term for an additional five years with no impact on rent and the second amendment extended the term of the master lease for an additional year with an incremental decrease in rent. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no lease renewals. During 2018, we transitioned two operating skilled nursing centers to another operator in our portfolio. This transition had no economic impact on us. Some of our lease agreements provide purchase options allowing the lessees to purchase the properties they currently lease from us. The following table summarizes information about purchase options included in our lease agreements:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nType\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCarrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOption\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInvestments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWindow\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nKansas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2019-2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTexas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2025-2027\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUpdate on Certain Operators\nDuring 2017, we issued a notice of default to Anthem Memory Care ( Anthem\u201d) resulting from Anthem's partial payment of minimum rent. Anthem operates 11 operational memory care communities under a master lease. We are currently not pursuing enforcement of the guarantees and our rights and remedies pertaining to known events of default under the master lease, with the stipulation that Anthem achieve sufficient performance and pay an agreed upon cash rent for these 11 properties. During 2018, Anthem paid the agreed upon minimum cash rent of $5.2 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Anthem agreed to pay a minimum of $7.5 million of annual cash rent throughout December 31, 2019. We receive regular financial performance updates from Anthem and continue to monitor Anthem's performance obligations under the master lease agreement.\nDuring 2017, Preferred Care, Inc. ( Preferred Care\u201d) and affiliated entities filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of a multi-million-dollar judgment in a lawsuit in Kentucky against Preferred Care and certain affiliated entities. The affiliated entities named in the lawsuit operate properties in Kentucky and New Mexico. Preferred Care leases 24 properties under two master leases from us and none of the 24 properties are located in Kentucky or New Mexico. Those 24 properties are in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas and Texas. The Preferred Care operating entities that sublease those properties did not file for bankruptcy. Our annual rental revenue from Preferred Care represented 6.4% of total rental and interest income as of December 31, 2018. The court ordered deadline for affirmation or rejection of the lease has passed without action by Preferred Care, but they continue to pay rent to us in a timely manner.\nOn December 4, 2018, Senior Care Centers, LLC. and affiliates and subsidiaries ( Senior Care\u201d) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of lease terminations from certain landlords and on-going operational challenges. Pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Senior Care has an initial period of 120 days from the petition date to assume or reject the lease. As security under the lease, we hold a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $2.0 million, maintenance and repair escrows of approximately $2.2 million and property tax escrows of approximately $1.8 million. Senior Care did not pay us December 2018 rent, but has paid us January and February 2019 rent.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, we placed Thrive Senior Living, LLC. on a cash basis due to short-payment of contractual rent in November 2018 and non-payment of rent in December 2018 totaling $0.7 million. This rent has been accrued and recorded in 2018 and we currently estimate it is collectible. Thrive has not paid January or February 2019 rent. As a result, we have issued a reservation of rights letter to Thrive. We are working with Thrive and exploring our options to maximize the value of these real estate assets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2018 Transactions Overview\nThe following tables summarizes our transactions in 2018 (dollar amounts in thousand):\nInvestment in Owned Properties\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nType\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInitial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTransaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBeds/Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\nILF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.75 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\nUDP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTexas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.25\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\nUDP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDuring 2018, we entered into a partnership to develop and own real estate.

These indicators are discussed below and relate to concentration risk and credit strength. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.\nConcentration Risk. We evaluate by gross real estate investment our concentration risk in terms of asset mix, real estate investment mix, operator mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is valuable to understand what portion of our real estate investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our real estate investments that are real property or mortgage loans. In order to qualify as an equity REIT, at least 50 percent of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items and government securities. Investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types. Operator mix measures the portion of our real estate investments that relate to our top five operators. Geographic mix measures the portion of our real estate investment that relate to our top five states.\nThe following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk (gross investment, in thousands):\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. Our leverage ratios include debt to gross asset value and debt to market capitalization. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our consolidated balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term obligations. Our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest). The coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) as defined by National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). EBITDAre is calculated as net income available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (iv) impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, (v) gains or losses on the sale of depreciable real estate, and (vi) adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.

stockholders, basic FFO attributable to common stockholders per share and diluted FFO attributable to common stockholders per share are supplemental measures of a REIT's financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. Real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, but cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. We believe that by excluding the effect of historical cost depreciation, which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods.\nWe use FFO as a supplemental performance measurement of our cash flow generated by operations. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of cash\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\navailable to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income available to common stockholders.\nWe calculate and report FFO in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the NAREIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on the sale of real estate and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from us; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our FFO to that of other REITs.\nThe following table reconciles net income available to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGAAP net income available to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n154,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n86,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: (Gain) loss on sale of real estate, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(70,682)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,814)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,582)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n122,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n117,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBasic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.06\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.10\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.06\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted average shares used to calculate NAREIT FFO per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBasic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,839\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,637\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,597\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncludes the effect of participating securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDiluted weighted average shares used to calculate FFO per share includes the effect of stock option equivalents, participating securities and performance-based stock units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSee Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $2.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $488.0 million available under our unsecured revolving line of credit and $93.8 million available under our senior unsecured note shelf agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we borrowed $26.4 million, net, under our unsecured revolving line of credit. Accordingly, we have $138.4 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving line of credit and $461.6 million available for borrowing. Additionally, subsequent to year-end, we paid down $4.2 million in regular scheduled principal payments under our senior unsecured notes. Accordingly, we have $528.9 million outstanding and $98.0 million available under our senior unsecured note shelf agreement. See Debt Obligations below for further discussion.\nWe have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, and currently have the ability to file additional automatic shelf registration statements, to provide us with capacity to offer an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt, depositary shares, or units. We may from time to time publicly raise capital under our automatic shelf registration statement in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of the offering.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdditionally, we have the ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of common stock by means of our equity distribution agreements under our automatic shelf registration statement. See Equity below for further discussion.\nWe believe that our current cash balance, cash flow from operations available for distribution or reinvestment, our borrowing capacity and our potential ability to access the capital markets are sufficient to provide for payment of our current operating costs, meet debt obligations and pay common dividends at least sufficient to maintain our REIT status and repay borrowings at, or prior to, their maturity. The timing, source and amount of cash flows used by financing and investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets' environment, especially to changes in interest rates. We continuously evaluate the availability of cost-effective capital and believe we have sufficient liquidity for additional capital investments in 2019.\nWe expect our future income and ability to make distributions from cash flows provided by operating activities to depend on the collectability of our rents and mortgage loans receivable. The collection of these loans and rents will be dependent, in large part, upon the successful operation by the operators of the seniors housing and health care properties we own or that are pledged to us. The operating results of the facilities may be impacted by various factors over which the operators/owners may have no control. Those factors include, without limitation, the status of the economy, changes in supply of or demand for competing seniors housing and health care facilities, ability to control rising operating costs, and the potential for significant reforms in the health care industry. In addition, our future growth in net income and cash flow may be adversely impacted by various proposals for changes in the governmental regulations and financing of the health care industry. We cannot presently predict what impact these proposals may have, if any. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for the possibility of loans proving uncollectible but we will continually evaluate the financial status of the operations of the seniors housing and health care properties. In addition, we will monitor our borrowers and the underlying collateral for mortgage loans and will make future revisions to the provision, if considered necessary.\nOur investments, principally our investments in mortgage loans and owned properties, are subject to the possibility of loss of their carrying values as a result of changes in market prices, interest rates and inflationary expectations. The effects on interest rates may affect our costs of financing our operations and the fair market value of our financial assets. Generally our loans have predetermined increases in interest rates and our leases have agreed upon annual increases. We may initially fund some of our investments with variable interest rate debt and, if so, we would be at risk of net interest margin deterioration if medium and long-term rates were to increase.\nOur primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility and proceeds from investment dispositions. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures and construction advances), loan advances and general and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n115,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,609)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(92,012)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n88,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(112,375)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16,071)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(96,304)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(449)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,778)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,778)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(449)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Obligations\nBank Borrowings. During 2018, we amended and restated our unsecured credit agreement to replace the previous unsecured credit agreement, prior to its expiration on October 14, 2018. The amended credit agreement maintains the $600.0 million aggregate commitment of the lenders under the prior agreement and provides for the opportunity to increase the commitment size of the credit agreement up to a total of $1.0 billion. The amended credit agreement extends the maturity of the credit agreement to June 27, 2022 and provides for a one-year extension option at our discretion, subject to customary conditions. Additionally, the amended credit agreement decreases the interest rate\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmargins and converts from the payment of unused commitment fees to a facility fee. Based on our leverage at December 31, 2018, the facility provides for interest annually at LIBOR plus 115 basis points and a facility fee of 20 basis points.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness and Investment Strategy\nWe are a self-administered health care real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) that invests primarily in seniors housing and health care properties through sale-leaseback transactions, mortgage financing, joint ventures and structured finance solutions including mezzanine lending. We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments, for internal reporting and internal decision making purposes. Our primary objectives are to create, sustain and enhance stockholder equity value and provide current income for distribution to stockholders through real estate investments in seniors housing and health care properties managed by experienced operators. Our primary seniors housing and health care property classifications include skilled nursing centers ( SNF\u201d), assisted living communities ( ALF\u201d), independent living communities ( ILF\u201d), memory care communities ( MC\u201d) and combinations thereof. ALF, ILF, MC, and combinations thereof are included in the ALF communities classification. We have been operating since August 1992.\nSubstantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals, interest earned on outstanding loans receivable and income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. Our investments in owned properties and mortgage loans represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon the performance of the operators on their lease and loan obligations and the rates earned thereon. To the extent that the operators experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by property type and operator. Our monitoring process includes periodic review of financial statements for each facility, periodic review of operator credit, scheduled property inspections and review of covenant compliance.\nIn addition to our monitoring and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. Some operating leases and loans are credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates.\nDepending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we anticipate making additional investments in health care related properties. New investments are generally funded from cash on hand, temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving line of credit and internally generated cash flows. Our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on mortgage loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving line of credit, is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and secured and unsecured debt financing. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets' environment, especially to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets' environment may impact the availability of cost-effective capital.\nWe believe our business model has enabled and will continue to enable us to maintain the integrity of our property investments, including in response to financial difficulties that may be experienced by operators. Traditionally, we have taken a conservative approach to managing our business, choosing to maintain liquidity and exercise patience until favorable investment opportunities arise.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPortfolio Overview\nThe following tables summarizes our real estate investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 82: <table> <tr>

In most instances, our lease structure contains fixed or estimable annual rental escalations, which are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. Certain leases have annual rental escalations that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. This revenue is not recognized until the appropriate contingencies have been resolved. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received $470,000, $457,000 and $517,000, respectively, of contingent rental income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $9.6 million in straight-line rental income and recorded $0.1 million of straight-line rent receivable reserve. For the remaining leases in place at December 31, 2018, assuming no modification or replacement of existing leases and no new leased investments are added to our portfolio, except for the lease extensions and completed developments in 2019 and the lease reported below under Update on Certain Operators, we currently expect that straight-line rental income will decrease from $9.6 million in 2018 to $4.1 million for projected annual 2019. Our cash rental income is projected to increase from $127.9 million in 2018 to $133.7 million for projected annual 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrecorded $2.1 million of lease incentives. At December 31, 2018, the straight-line rent receivable balance, net of reserves, on the consolidated balance sheet was $73.9 million.\nMany of our existing leases contain renewal options that, if exercised, could result in the amount of rent payable upon renewal being greater or less than that currently being paid. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two existing leases were amended to extend the term of the master lease. The first amendment extended the master lease term for an additional five years with no impact on rent and the second amendment extended the term of the master lease for an additional year with an incremental decrease in rent. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no lease renewals. During 2018, we transitioned two operating skilled nursing centers to another operator in our portfolio. This transition had no economic impact on us. Some of our lease agreements provide purchase options allowing the lessees to purchase the properties they currently lease from us.

Anthem operates 11 operational memory care communities under a master lease. We are currently not pursuing enforcement of the guarantees and our rights and remedies pertaining to known events of default under the master lease, with the stipulation that Anthem achieve sufficient performance and pay an agreed upon cash rent for these 11 properties. During 2018, Anthem paid the agreed upon minimum cash rent of $5.2 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Anthem agreed to pay a minimum of $7.5 million of annual cash rent throughout December 31, 2019. We receive regular financial performance updates from Anthem and continue to monitor Anthem's performance obligations under the master lease agreement.\nDuring 2017, Preferred Care, Inc. ( Preferred Care\u201d) and affiliated entities filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of a multi-million-dollar judgment in a lawsuit in Kentucky against Preferred Care and certain affiliated entities. The affiliated entities named in the lawsuit operate properties in Kentucky and New Mexico. Preferred Care leases 24 properties under two master leases from us and none of the 24 properties are located in Kentucky or New Mexico. Those 24 properties are in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas and Texas. The Preferred Care operating entities that sublease those properties did not file for bankruptcy. Our annual rental revenue from Preferred Care represented 6.4% of total rental and interest income as of December 31, 2018. The court ordered deadline for affirmation or rejection of the lease has passed without action by Preferred Care, but they continue to pay rent to us in a timely manner.\nOn December 4, 2018, Senior Care Centers, LLC. and affiliates and subsidiaries ( Senior Care\u201d) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of lease terminations from certain landlords and on-going operational challenges. Pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Senior Care has an initial period of 120 days from the petition date to assume or reject the lease. As security under the lease, we hold a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $2.0 million, maintenance and repair escrows of approximately $2.2 million and property tax escrows of approximately $1.8 million. Senior Care did not pay us December 2018 rent, but has paid us January and February 2019 rent.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, we placed Thrive Senior Living, LLC. on a cash basis due to short-payment of contractual rent in November 2018 and non-payment of rent in December 2018 totaling $0.7 million. This rent has been accrued and recorded in 2018 and we currently estimate it is collectible. Thrive has not paid January or February 2019 rent. As a result, we have issued a reservation of rights letter to Thrive. We are working with Thrive and exploring our options to maximize the value of these real estate assets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2018 Transactions Overview\nThe following tables summarizes our transactions in 2018 (dollar amounts in thousand):\nInvestment in Owned Properties\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nType\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInitial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTransaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAcquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProperties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBeds/Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\nILF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.75 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\nUDP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTexas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.25\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\nUDP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) During 2018, we entered into a partnership to develop and own real estate.

As of December 31, 2018, we still hold $177 which will be applied to future interest. \nInvestment in Notes Receivable\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a $6.8 million mezzanine loan commitment for the development of a 204-unit ILF/ALF/MC in Georgia which will be funded during the first quarter of 2019. The mezzanine loan has a five-year term and bears interest at 12%, with 8% current-pay during the first 46 months of the loan, and the balance accruing to the note and 12% current-pay thereafter.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nKey Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to concentration risk and credit strength. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.\nConcentration Risk. We evaluate by gross real estate investment our concentration risk in terms of asset mix, real estate investment mix, operator mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is valuable to understand what portion of our real estate investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our real estate investments that are real property or mortgage loans. In order to qualify as an equity REIT, at least 50 percent of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items and government securities. Investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types. Operator mix measures the portion of our real estate investments that relate to our top five operators. Geographic mix measures the portion of our real estate investment that relate to our top five states.\nThe following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk (gross investment, in thousands):\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

These parcels are located adjacent to properties securing the Prestige Healthcare mortgage loan and are managed by Prestige. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCredit Strength. We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. Our leverage ratios include debt to gross asset value and debt to market capitalization. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our consolidated balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term obligations. Our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest). The coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) as defined by National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). EBITDAre is calculated as net income available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (iv) impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, (v) gains or losses on the sale of depreciable real estate, and (vi) adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.

Operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders, basic FFO attributable to common stockholders per share and diluted FFO attributable to common stockholders per share are supplemental measures of a REIT's financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. Real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, but cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. We believe that by excluding the effect of historical cost depreciation, which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods.\nWe use FFO as a supplemental performance measurement of our cash flow generated by operations. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of cash\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\navailable to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income available to common stockholders.\nWe calculate and report FFO in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the NAREIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on the sale of real estate and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from us; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our FFO to that of other REITs.\nThe following table reconciles net income available to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGAAP net income available to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n154,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n86,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd: Impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: (Gain) loss on sale of real estate, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(70,682)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,814)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,582)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n122,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n117,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBasic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.06\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.10\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.06\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted average shares used to calculate NAREIT FFO per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBasic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,839\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,637\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,597\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes the effect of participating securities. \n (2) Diluted weighted average shares used to calculate FFO per share includes the effect of stock option equivalents, participating securities and performance-based stock units. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nSee Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $2.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $488.0 million available under our unsecured revolving line of credit and $93.8 million available under our senior unsecured note shelf agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we borrowed $26.4 million, net, under our unsecured revolving line of credit. Accordingly, we have $138.4 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving line of credit and $461.6 million available for borrowing. Additionally, subsequent to year-end, we paid down $4.2 million in regular scheduled principal payments under our senior unsecured notes. Accordingly, we have $528.9 million outstanding and $98.0 million available under our senior unsecured note shelf agreement. See Debt Obligations below for further discussion.\nWe have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, and currently have the ability to file additional automatic shelf registration statements, to provide us with capacity to offer an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt, depositary shares, or units. We may from time to time publicly raise capital under our automatic shelf registration statement in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of the offering.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdditionally, we have the ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of common stock by means of our equity distribution agreements under our automatic shelf registration statement. See Equity below for further discussion.\nWe believe that our current cash balance, cash flow from operations available for distribution or reinvestment, our borrowing capacity and our potential ability to access the capital markets are sufficient to provide for payment of our current operating costs, meet debt obligations and pay common dividends at least sufficient to maintain our REIT status and repay borrowings at, or prior to, their maturity. The timing, source and amount of cash flows used by financing and investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets' environment, especially to changes in interest rates. We continuously evaluate the availability of cost-effective capital and believe we have sufficient liquidity for additional capital investments in 2019.\nWe expect our future income and ability to make distributions from cash flows provided by operating activities to depend on the collectability of our rents and mortgage loans receivable. The collection of these loans and rents will be dependent, in large part, upon the successful operation by the operators of the seniors housing and health care properties we own or that are pledged to us. The operating results of the facilities may be impacted by various factors over which the operators/owners may have no control. Those factors include, without limitation, the status of the economy, changes in supply of or demand for competing seniors housing and health care facilities, ability to control rising operating costs, and the potential for significant reforms in the health care industry. In addition, our future growth in net income and cash flow may be adversely impacted by various proposals for changes in the governmental regulations and financing of the health care industry. We cannot presently predict what impact these proposals may have, if any. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for the possibility of loans proving uncollectible but we will continually evaluate the financial status of the operations of the seniors housing and health care properties. In addition, we will monitor our borrowers and the underlying collateral for mortgage loans and will make future revisions to the provision, if considered necessary.\nOur investments, principally our investments in mortgage loans and owned properties, are subject to the possibility of loss of their carrying values as a result of changes in market prices, interest rates and inflationary expectations. The effects on interest rates may affect our costs of financing our operations and the fair market value of our financial assets. Generally our loans have predetermined increases in interest rates and our leases have agreed upon annual increases. We may initially fund some of our investments with variable interest rate debt and, if so, we would be at risk of net interest margin deterioration if medium and long-term rates were to increase.\nOur primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility and proceeds from investment dispositions. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures and construction advances), loan advances and general and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n115,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,609)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(92,012)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n88,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(112,375)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16,071)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(96,304)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(449)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,778)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,778)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(449)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Obligations\nBank Borrowings. During 2018, we amended and restated our unsecured credit agreement to replace the previous unsecured credit agreement, prior to its expiration on October 14, 2018. The amended credit agreement maintains the $600.0 million aggregate commitment of the lenders under the prior agreement and provides for the opportunity to increase the commitment size of the credit agreement up to a total of $1.0 billion. The amended credit agreement extends the maturity of the credit agreement to June 27, 2022 and provides for a one-year extension option at our discretion, subject to customary conditions. Additionally, the amended credit agreement decreases the interest rate\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmargins and converts from the payment of unused commitment fees to a facility fee. Based on our leverage at December 31, 2018, the facility provides for interest annually at LIBOR plus 115 basis points and a facility fee of 20 basis points. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nSenior Unsecured Notes. We have a $337.5 million shelf agreement with affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential Investment Management, Inc.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared and paid $90.4 million of cash dividends.\nCommon Stock. We have an equity distribution agreement with sales agents to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $200.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common shares. The equity distribution agreement provides for sales of common shares to be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions, which may include block trades, or transactions that are deemed to be at the market\u201d offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 22,244 shares of common stock for $1.0 million in net proceeds under our equity distribution agreement. In conjunction with the sale of common stock, we paid $18,000 as compensation to our sales agents and we reclassified $76,000 of accumulated costs associated with this agreement to additional paid in capital. At December 31, 2018, we had $184.1 million available under our equity distribution agreement.\nDuring 2018, we acquired 31,326 shares of common stock held by employees who tendered owned shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we acquired 20,345 shares of common stock held by employees who tendered owned shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.19 per share on our common stock for the months of January, February and March 2019, payable on January 31, February 28 and March 29, 2019, respectively, to stockholders of record on January 23, February 20 and March 21, 2019, respectively.\nNon-controlling Interests. During 2018, we entered into partnerships to develop and/or own real estate. Given that our limited members do not have substantive kick-out rights, liquidation rights, or participation rights, we have concluded that the partnerships are VIEs. Since we exercise power over and receive benefits from the VIEs, we are\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconsidered the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidate the VIEs and record the non-controlling interests at cost.

The non-controlling partner contributed $1,081 of cash and we committed to fund the remaining $17,027 project cost. Additionally during 2018, in a sale-leaseback transaction, the JV purchased an existing operational 89-unit ILF adjacent to the 78-unit ALF/MC we are developing for $14,400. The non-controlling partner contributed $2,857 of equity and we contributed $11,543 in cash. Upon completion of the development project, our combined economic interest in the JV will be approximately 88%. \nStock Based Compensation Plans. During 2015, we adopted, and our stockholders approved the 2015 Equity Participation Plan (the 2015 Plan\u201d) which 1,400,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for awards, including nonqualified stock option grants and restricted stock grants to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The terms of the awards granted under the 2015 Plan are set by our compensation committee at its discretion.\nRestricted Stock and Performance-based Stock Units.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness and Investment Strategy\nWe are a self-administered health care real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) that invests primarily in seniors housing and health care properties through sale-leaseback transactions, mortgage financing, joint ventures and structured finance solutions including mezzanine lending. We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments, for internal reporting and internal decision making purposes. Our primary objectives are to create, sustain and enhance stockholder equity value and provide current income for distribution to stockholders through real estate investments in seniors housing and health care properties managed by experienced operators. Our primary seniors housing and health care property classifications include skilled nursing centers ( SNF\u201d), assisted living communities ( ALF\u201d), independent living communities ( ILF\u201d), memory care communities ( MC\u201d) and combinations thereof. ALF, ILF, MC, and combinations thereof are included in the ALF communities classification. We have been operating since August 1992.\nSubstantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals, interest earned on outstanding loans receivable and income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. Our investments in owned properties and mortgage loans represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon the performance of the operators on their lease and loan obligations and the rates earned thereon. To the extent that the operators experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by property type and operator. Our monitoring process includes periodic review of financial statements for each facility, periodic review of operator credit, scheduled property inspections and review of covenant compliance.\nIn addition to our monitoring and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. Some operating leases and loans are credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates.\nDepending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we anticipate making additional investments in health care related properties. New investments are generally funded from cash on hand, temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving line of credit and internally generated cash flows. Our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on mortgage loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving line of credit, is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and secured and unsecured debt financing. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets' environment, especially to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets' environment may impact the availability of cost-effective capital.\nWe believe our business model has enabled and will continue to enable us to maintain the integrity of our property investments, including in response to financial difficulties that may be experienced by operators. Traditionally, we have taken a conservative approach to managing our business, choosing to maintain liquidity and exercise patience until favorable investment opportunities arise.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPortfolio Overview\nThe following tables summarizes our real estate investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n\n (1) Excludes rental income from properties sold during 2018. \n (2) Excludes interest income from mortgage loans paid off during 2018. \n (3) We have investments in 28 states leased or mortgaged to 28 different operators. \n (4) See Item 2. Properties for discussion of bed/unit count. \n (5) Includes ALF, ILF, MC, and combinations thereof. \n (6) Represents three development projects, consisting of a 143-bed SNF in Kentucky, a 78-unit ALF/MC located in Oregon and a 110-unit ILF/ALF/MC in Wisconsin. \n (7) Includes three parcels of land held-for-use and one behavioral health care hospital. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.3 billion in carrying value of net real estate investments, consisting of $1.1 billion or 82.0% invested in owned and leased properties and $0.2 billion or 18.0% invested in mortgage loans secured by first mortgages.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, rental income and interest income from mortgage loans represented 80.3% and 16.7%, respectively, of total gross revenues. In most instances, our lease structure contains fixed or estimable annual rental escalations, which are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. Certain leases have annual rental escalations that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. This revenue is not recognized until the appropriate contingencies have been resolved. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received $470,000, $457,000 and $517,000, respectively, of contingent rental income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $9.6 million in straight-line rental income and recorded $0.1 million of straight-line rent receivable reserve. For the remaining leases in place at December 31, 2018, assuming no modification or replacement of existing leases and no new leased investments are added to our portfolio, except for the lease extensions and completed developments in 2019 and the lease reported below under Update on Certain Operators, we currently expect that straight-line rental income will decrease from $9.6 million in 2018 to $4.1 million for projected annual 2019. Our cash rental income is projected to increase from $127.9 million in 2018 to $133.7 million for projected annual 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrecorded $2.1 million of lease incentives. At December 31, 2018, the straight-line rent receivable balance, net of reserves, on the consolidated balance sheet was $73.9 million.\nMany of our existing leases contain renewal options that, if exercised, could result in the amount of rent payable upon renewal being greater or less than that currently being paid. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two existing leases were amended to extend the term of the master lease. The first amendment extended the master lease term for an additional five years with no impact on rent and the second amendment extended the term of the master lease for an additional year with an incremental decrease in rent. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no lease renewals. During 2018, we transitioned two operating skilled nursing centers to another operator in our portfolio. This transition had no economic impact on us. Some of our lease agreements provide purchase options allowing the lessees to purchase the properties they currently lease from us. The following table summarizes information about purchase options included in our lease agreements:\n\nUpdate on Certain Operators\nDuring 2017, we issued a notice of default to Anthem Memory Care ( Anthem\u201d) resulting from Anthem's partial payment of minimum rent. Anthem operates 11 operational memory care communities under a master lease. We are currently not pursuing enforcement of the guarantees and our rights and remedies pertaining to known events of default under the master lease, with the stipulation that Anthem achieve sufficient performance and pay an agreed upon cash rent for these 11 properties. During 2018, Anthem paid the agreed upon minimum cash rent of $5.2 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Anthem agreed to pay a minimum of $7.5 million of annual cash rent throughout December 31, 2019. We receive regular financial performance updates from Anthem and continue to monitor Anthem's performance obligations under the master lease agreement.\nDuring 2017, Preferred Care, Inc. ( Preferred Care\u201d) and affiliated entities filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of a multi-million-dollar judgment in a lawsuit in Kentucky against Preferred Care and certain affiliated entities. The affiliated entities named in the lawsuit operate properties in Kentucky and New Mexico. Preferred Care leases 24 properties under two master leases from us and none of the 24 properties are located in Kentucky or New Mexico. Those 24 properties are in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas and Texas. The Preferred Care operating entities that sublease those properties did not file for bankruptcy. Our annual rental revenue from Preferred Care represented 6.4% of total rental and interest income as of December 31, 2018. The court ordered deadline for affirmation or rejection of the lease has passed without action by Preferred Care, but they continue to pay rent to us in a timely manner.\nOn December 4, 2018, Senior Care Centers, LLC. and affiliates and subsidiaries ( Senior Care\u201d) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of lease terminations from certain landlords and on-going operational challenges. Pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Senior Care has an initial period of 120 days from the petition date to assume or reject the lease. As security under the lease, we hold a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $2.0 million, maintenance and repair escrows of approximately $2.2 million and property tax escrows of approximately $1.8 million. Senior Care did not pay us December 2018 rent, but has paid us January and February 2019 rent.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, we placed Thrive Senior Living, LLC. on a cash basis due to short-payment of contractual rent in November 2018 and non-payment of rent in December 2018 totaling $0.7 million. This rent has been accrued and recorded in 2018 and we currently estimate it is collectible. Thrive has not paid January or February 2019 rent. As a result, we have issued a reservation of rights letter to Thrive. We are working with Thrive and exploring our options to maximize the value of these real estate assets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2018 Transactions Overview\nThe following tables summarizes our transactions in 2018 (dollar amounts in thousand):\nInvestment in Owned Properties\n\n (1) During 2018, we entered into a partnership to develop and own real estate. Under the partnership agreement, we acquired a parcel of land to develop a 78-unit ALF and MC in Medford, OR for a total commitment of $18,108, and an existing operational 89-unit ILF in Oregon for $14,400. \n (2) We acquired a parcel of land adjacent to an existing UDP. \nSold Properties\n\n (1) We sold land adjacent to an existing ALF community in Kansas. \nDevelopment Projects\n\nCompleted Developments\n\nInvestment in Mortgage Loans\n\n (1) During 2018, we funded an additional $7,400 under an existing mortgage loan for the purchase of a 112-bed SNF in Michigan. The incremental funding bears interest at 8.7%, fixed for five years, and escalating by 2.25% thereafter. Also, we funded additional loan proceeds of $7,125 under an existing mortgage loan for the purchase of a 126-bed SNF in Michigan. This incremental funding bears interest at 9.41%, fixed for five years, and escalating by 2.25% thereafter. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\n\n (1) Since interest payments were deferred and no interest was recorded for the first twelve months of the loan, we used the effective interest method in accordance with GAAP to recognize interest income and recorded the difference between the effective interest income and cash interest income to the loan principal balance. \n (2) We withheld $653 at the time of loan origination which is being applied to interest. As of December 31, 2018, we still hold $177 which will be applied to future interest. \nInvestment in Notes Receivable\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a $6.8 million mezzanine loan commitment for the development of a 204-unit ILF/ALF/MC in Georgia which will be funded during the first quarter of 2019. The mezzanine loan has a five-year term and bears interest at 12%, with 8% current-pay during the first 46 months of the loan, and the balance accruing to the note and 12% current-pay thereafter.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nKey Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to concentration risk and credit strength. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.\nConcentration Risk. We evaluate by gross real estate investment our concentration risk in terms of asset mix, real estate investment mix, operator mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is valuable to understand what portion of our real estate investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our real estate investments that are real property or mortgage loans. In order to qualify as an equity REIT, at least 50 percent of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items and government securities. Investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types. Operator mix measures the portion of our real estate investments that relate to our top five operators. Geographic mix measures the portion of our real estate investment that relate to our top five states.\nThe following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk (gross investment, in thousands):\n\n (1) We have three parcels of land as of December 31, 2018. These parcels are located adjacent to properties securing the Prestige Healthcare mortgage loan and are managed by Prestige. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCredit Strength. We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. Our leverage ratios include debt to gross asset value and debt to market capitalization. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our consolidated balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term obligations. Our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest). The coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) as defined by National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). EBITDAre is calculated as net income available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (iv) impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, (v) gains or losses on the sale of depreciable real estate, and (vi) adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures:\nBalance Sheet Metrics\n\n (1) Decreased due to decrease in outstanding debt partially offset by decrease in gross asset value. \n (2) Increased due to decrease in market capitalization, partially offset by decrease in outstanding debt. \n (3) Increased due to decrease in interest expense and increase in other income from the net write-off of Senior Lifestyle contingent lease incentive and the related earn-out liability. \n (4) Decreased due to decrease in outstanding debt and increase in gross asset value from acquisitions partially offset by sold properties and loan payoffs. \n (5) Decreased due to decrease in outstanding debt and increase in market capitalization. \n (6) Increased primarily due to increase in outstanding debt partially offset by the increase in gross asset value from acquisitions, additional development and capital improvement funding. \n (7) Increased primarily due to increase in outstanding debt and decrease in market capitalization. \n (8) In calculating our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios above, we use EBITDAre, which is a financial measure not derived in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) (non-GAAP financial measure). EBITDAre is not an alternative to net income, operating income or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. You should not rely on EBITDAre as a substitute for any such GAAP financial measures or consider it in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our financial performance, financial position or cash flows. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDAre. \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u00b7 The status of the economy; \n \u00b7 The status of capital markets, including prevailing interest rates; \n \u00b7 Compliance with and changes to regulations and payment policies within the health care industry; \n \u00b7 Changes in financing terms; \n \u00b7 Competition within the health care and seniors housing industries; and \n \u00b7 Changes in federal, state and local legislation. \nManagement regularly monitors the economic and other factors listed above. We develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOperating Results\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Decreased due the reduction of rent related to the properties sold during 2018 and Senior Care Centers non-payment of December rent as a result of the bankruptcy filing, partially offset by acquisitions and capital improvements. \n (2) Increased primarily due to mortgage originations and capital improvement funding partially offset by payoffs. \n (3) Increased primarily due to the net impact of the write-off of an earn-out liability and the related lease incentive asset during 2018 partially offset by decrease in interest income due to mezzanine loan payoffs and write-off of an earn-out liability and related lease incentive asset during 2017. \n (4) Increased primarily due to a higher average outstanding balance on our line of credit and an increase in LIBOR rates, partially offset by scheduled principal payments under our senior unsecured notes and an increase in capitalized interest related to development projects. \n (5) Represents the write-off of straight-line rent and other receivables in 2017 related to two properties due to negotiations to transition these properties to another operator in our portfolio. \n (6) Increased primarily due to lower incentive compensation in the prior year related to a previously disclosed defaulted master lease. \n (7) Represents the net gain on sale of six ALF and four SNF properties during 2018, partially offset by a net gain on sale of five ALF and a donation of a SNF during 2017. \n (8) Increased primarily due to income generated from additional funding under a preferred capital contribution commitment and income from a mezzanine loan accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture in accordance with GAAP which was previously deferred. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands)\n\n (1) Increased due to acquisitions, development and capital improvement investments partially offset by a defaulted master lease placed on cash basis, as previously discussed, and the reduction of rent related to the properties sold in 2017. \n (2) Decreased primarily due to mortgage loan payoffs partially offset by capital improvement funding under certain mortgage loans. \n (3) Increased primarily due to mezzanine loan originations, write-off of an earn-out liability and the related lease incentive asset. \n (4) Increased primarily due to sales of senior unsecured notes and a decrease in capitalized interest related to development projects partially offset by a decrease in borrowing under our unsecured revolving line of credit. \n (5) Represents the write-off of straight-line rent and other receivables related to two properties in conjunction with our negotiations to transition these properties to another operator in our portfolio in 2017, partially offset by the write-down of a property in 2016 to its estimated sale price. \n (6) Decreased due to mortgage loan payoffs and reversal of straight-line rent reserve. \n (7) Consists of a net gain on sale of five ALF partially offset by the donation of a SNF to a nonprofit health care provider. \n (8) Consists of a net gain on sale of two SNF and an ALF, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of a school. \n (9) Increased primarily due to income generated from additional funding under a preferred capital contribution commitment and income from a mezzanine loan accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture in accordance with GAAP which was previously deferred. \nFunds From Operations\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders, basic FFO attributable to common stockholders per share and diluted FFO attributable to common stockholders per share are supplemental measures of a REIT's financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. Real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, but cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. We believe that by excluding the effect of historical cost depreciation, which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods.\nWe use FFO as a supplemental performance measurement of our cash flow generated by operations. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of cash\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\navailable to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income available to common stockholders.\nWe calculate and report FFO in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the NAREIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on the sale of real estate and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from us; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our FFO to that of other REITs.\nThe following table reconciles net income available to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\n (1) Includes the effect of participating securities. \n (2) Diluted weighted average shares used to calculate FFO per share includes the effect of stock option equivalents, participating securities and performance-based stock units. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nSee Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $2.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $488.0 million available under our unsecured revolving line of credit and $93.8 million available under our senior unsecured note shelf agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we borrowed $26.4 million, net, under our unsecured revolving line of credit. Accordingly, we have $138.4 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving line of credit and $461.6 million available for borrowing. Additionally, subsequent to year-end, we paid down $4.2 million in regular scheduled principal payments under our senior unsecured notes. Accordingly, we have $528.9 million outstanding and $98.0 million available under our senior unsecured note shelf agreement. See Debt Obligations below for further discussion.\nWe have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, and currently have the ability to file additional automatic shelf registration statements, to provide us with capacity to offer an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt, depositary shares, or units. We may from time to time publicly raise capital under our automatic shelf registration statement in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of the offering.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdditionally, we have the ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of common stock by means of our equity distribution agreements under our automatic shelf registration statement. See Equity below for further discussion.\nWe believe that our current cash balance, cash flow from operations available for distribution or reinvestment, our borrowing capacity and our potential ability to access the capital markets are sufficient to provide for payment of our current operating costs, meet debt obligations and pay common dividends at least sufficient to maintain our REIT status and repay borrowings at, or prior to, their maturity. The timing, source and amount of cash flows used by financing and investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets' environment, especially to changes in interest rates. We continuously evaluate the availability of cost-effective capital and believe we have sufficient liquidity for additional capital investments in 2019.\nWe expect our future income and ability to make distributions from cash flows provided by operating activities to depend on the collectability of our rents and mortgage loans receivable. The collection of these loans and rents will be dependent, in large part, upon the successful operation by the operators of the seniors housing and health care properties we own or that are pledged to us. The operating results of the facilities may be impacted by various factors over which the operators/owners may have no control. Those factors include, without limitation, the status of the economy, changes in supply of or demand for competing seniors housing and health care facilities, ability to control rising operating costs, and the potential for significant reforms in the health care industry. In addition, our future growth in net income and cash flow may be adversely impacted by various proposals for changes in the governmental regulations and financing of the health care industry. We cannot presently predict what impact these proposals may have, if any. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for the possibility of loans proving uncollectible but we will continually evaluate the financial status of the operations of the seniors housing and health care properties. In addition, we will monitor our borrowers and the underlying collateral for mortgage loans and will make future revisions to the provision, if considered necessary.\nOur investments, principally our investments in mortgage loans and owned properties, are subject to the possibility of loss of their carrying values as a result of changes in market prices, interest rates and inflationary expectations. The effects on interest rates may affect our costs of financing our operations and the fair market value of our financial assets. Generally our loans have predetermined increases in interest rates and our leases have agreed upon annual increases. We may initially fund some of our investments with variable interest rate debt and, if so, we would be at risk of net interest margin deterioration if medium and long-term rates were to increase.\nOur primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility and proceeds from investment dispositions. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures and construction advances), loan advances and general and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as summarized below (in thousands):\n\nDebt Obligations\nBank Borrowings. During 2018, we amended and restated our unsecured credit agreement to replace the previous unsecured credit agreement, prior to its expiration on October 14, 2018. The amended credit agreement maintains the $600.0 million aggregate commitment of the lenders under the prior agreement and provides for the opportunity to increase the commitment size of the credit agreement up to a total of $1.0 billion. The amended credit agreement extends the maturity of the credit agreement to June 27, 2022 and provides for a one-year extension option at our discretion, subject to customary conditions. Additionally, the amended credit agreement decreases the interest rate\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmargins and converts from the payment of unused commitment fees to a facility fee. Based on our leverage at December 31, 2018, the facility provides for interest annually at LIBOR plus 115 basis points and a facility fee of 20 basis points. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nSenior Unsecured Notes. We have a $337.5 million shelf agreement with affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential Investment Management, Inc. ( Prudential\u201d) with $93.8 million available for borrowing.\nThe debt obligations by component as of December 31, 2018 are as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n (1) Represents weighted average of interest rate as of December 31, 2018. \n (2) Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we borrowed $26,400, net under our unsecured revolving line of credit, accordingly we have $138,400 outstanding and $461,600 available for borrowing. \n (3) Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we paid down $4.2 million in regular scheduled principal payments. Accordingly, we have $528.9 million outstanding and $98.0 million available under our senior unsecured notes. \nOur debt borrowings and repayments during the year ended December 31, 2018, are as follows (in thousands):\n\nEquity\nAt December 31, 2018, we had 39,656,737 shares of common stock outstanding, equity on our balance sheet totaled $833.0 million and our equity securities had a market value of $1.7 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared and paid $90.4 million of cash dividends.\nCommon Stock. We have an equity distribution agreement with sales agents to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $200.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common shares. The equity distribution agreement provides for sales of common shares to be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions, which may include block trades, or transactions that are deemed to be at the market\u201d offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 22,244 shares of common stock for $1.0 million in net proceeds under our equity distribution agreement. In conjunction with the sale of common stock, we paid $18,000 as compensation to our sales agents and we reclassified $76,000 of accumulated costs associated with this agreement to additional paid in capital. At December 31, 2018, we had $184.1 million available under our equity distribution agreement.\nDuring 2018, we acquired 31,326 shares of common stock held by employees who tendered owned shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we acquired 20,345 shares of common stock held by employees who tendered owned shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.19 per share on our common stock for the months of January, February and March 2019, payable on January 31, February 28 and March 29, 2019, respectively, to stockholders of record on January 23, February 20 and March 21, 2019, respectively.\nNon-controlling Interests. During 2018, we entered into partnerships to develop and/or own real estate. Given that our limited members do not have substantive kick-out rights, liquidation rights, or participation rights, we have concluded that the partnerships are VIEs. Since we exercise power over and receive benefits from the VIEs, we are\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconsidered the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidate the VIEs and record the non-controlling interests at cost. During 2018, we invested in the following consolidated VIEs (in thousands):\n\n (1) We entered into a joint venture ( JV\u201d) to develop, purchase and own senior housing properties. During 2018, the JV purchased land for the development of a 78-unit ALF/MC for a total anticipated project cost of $18,108. The non-controlling partner contributed $1,081 of cash and we committed to fund the remaining $17,027 project cost. Additionally during 2018, in a sale-leaseback transaction, the JV purchased an existing operational 89-unit ILF adjacent to the 78-unit ALF/MC we are developing for $14,400. The non-controlling partner contributed $2,857 of equity and we contributed $11,543 in cash. Upon completion of the development project, our combined economic interest in the JV will be approximately 88%. \nStock Based Compensation Plans. During 2015, we adopted, and our stockholders approved the 2015 Equity Participation Plan (the 2015 Plan\u201d) which 1,400,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for awards, including nonqualified stock option grants and restricted stock grants to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The terms of the awards granted under the 2015 Plan are set by our compensation committee at its discretion.\nRestricted Stock and Performance-based Stock Units. During 2018, we granted 156,718 shares of restricted common stock and performance-based stock units under the 2015 Plan as follows:\n\n (1) Vesting is based on achieving certain total shareholder return ( TSR\u201d) targets in 4 years with acceleration opportunity in 3 years. \nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, we granted 139,112 shares of restricted common stock and performance-based stock units at $46.54 per share. Out of these shares, 78,276 vest ratably from the grant date over a three-year period and 60,836 vest based on achieving certain TSR targets in 4 years with acceleration opportunity in 3 years.\nAt December 31, 2018, the total number of restricted common stock and performance-based stock units that are scheduled to vest and remaining compensation expense to be recognized related to the future service period of unvested outstanding restricted common stock and performance-based stock units are as follows:\n\n (1) Includes 49,728 performance-based stock units. The performance-based stock units are valued utilizing a lattice-binomial option pricing model based on Monte Carlo simulations. The company recognizes the fair value of the awards over the applicable vesting period as compensation expense. \n (2) Includes 53,554 performance-based stock units. See (1) above for valuation methodology. \n (3) Includes 66,171 performance-based stock units. See (1) above for valuation methodology. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nStock Options. We did not issue any stock options during the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, a total of 5,000 stock options were exercised at a total option value of $123,000 and a total market value on the date of exercise of $205,000. At December 31, 2018, we have 20,000 stock options outstanding and exercisable.\nContractual Obligations\nWe monitor our contractual obligations and commitments detailed above to ensure funds are available to meet obligations when due. The following table represents our long-term contractual obligations (scheduled principal payments and amounts due at maturity) as of December 31, 2018, excluding the effects of interest and debt issue costs (in thousands):\n\n (1) Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we borrowed $26,400, net, under our unsecured revolving line of credit. Accordingly, we have $138,400 outstanding and $461,600 available under our unsecured revolving line of credit. \n (2) Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we paid down $4,167 in regular scheduled principal payments. Accordingly, we have $528,862 outstanding and $98,000 available under our senior unsecured notes. \nThe following table represents our projected interest expense, excluding capitalized interest, amortization of debt issue costs, bank fees and earn-out accretion, as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements:\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December
