MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business: We are a leading global supplier of a broad range of components, accessories, and systems to the automotive, small engine, heavy-duty, marine, railroad, agricultural, off-road, aerospace and energy, industrial, and transport markets, including customers in both the original equipment manufacturers ( OEM\u201d) and servicers ( OES\u201d) (collectively OE\u201d) market and the replacement market ( aftermarket\u201d). Our customers include the world's largest automotive OEs, and major distributors and retailers in the independent aftermarket.\nWe operate with two end-customer focused business segments. The Powertrain segment focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy duty and industrial applications. Powertrain operates manufacturing facilities in 19 countries and derived 35% of its 2015 OE sales in North America, 46% in Europe, the Middle-East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), and 19% in the rest of the world (\"Rest of World\" or \"ROW\"). The Motorparts segment sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket including more than 20 globally-recognized brands. We also serve OEMs with products including braking, wipers, and a limited range of chassis components. Motorparts operates manufacturing sites in 15 countries and distribution centers and warehouses in 13 countries. In 2015, Motorparts derived 56% of its sales in North America, 37% in EMEA, and 7% in Rest of World.\nTermination of Spin-off: On January 15, 2016, we announced the termination of the previously announced spin-off of the Motorparts division. We will continue to operate with two separate, independent businesses with separate CEOs who will each report directly to our board of directors. The separate businesses more effectively serve their unique markets and allow each operating business to pursue its business strategy and more quickly react to its unique market conditions.\nFinancial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015: Consolidated net sales were $7,419 million, an increase of $102 million, or 1.4%. The increase was primarily driven by a 10% increase in sales volumes of $734 million (which included a $657 million benefit from acquisitions), which was substantially offset by the $642 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of products sold was $6,345 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $85 million, or 1%. The increase was driven by $645 million in incremental costs related to higher sales volumes attributable to acquisitions, and partly to volumes related to organic growth. This was substantially offset by the $529 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange and $31 million of savings from net performance. Net performance gains were burdened by incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division and strategic initiatives within both divisions.\nGross profit increased by $17 million to $1,074 million, or 14.5% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,057 million, or 14.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of $98 million, which included the effect of acquisitions, and the $32 million favorable effect of performance, which was offset by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net loss attributable to Federal-Mogul for the year-ended December 31, 2015 was $110 million, which included goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $94 million, and restructuring charges and asset impairments of $121 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We impaired $50 million and $44 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts and Powertrain segments, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restructuring charges and asset impairments were comprised of $62 million related to the Powertrain segment and $59 million related to the Motorparts segment.

This was attributable to the additional strategic investments made during 2015 including the acquisition of TRW's valvetrain business, which was funded primarily by our revolving line of credit. We had $194 million of cash and $170 million of availability under our credit facilities at December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Trends and Market Conditions:\nOur business and operating results are affected by the relative strength of:\nGeneral economic conditions: Our OE business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive sales depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by three primary factors including: the number of vehicles in operation; the average age of vehicles; and vehicle usage trends (primarily distance traveled).\nEarly estimates of global GDP indicate a 2.4 percent increase in 2015. Major factors contributing to this rate of growth include generally stable conditions in developed regions and slowing growth in emerging markets. While the Chinese economic growth rate slowed from previous years, GDP estimates indicate 6.9 percent growth in 2015. Full-year GDP estimates for the European Union, Japan, and the United States are 1.5, 0.8 and 2.5 percent, respectively. Economic conditions in key regions remain mixed. However, the combination of low interest rates and declining fuel prices continues to support vehicle sales and production globally. Declining commodity prices have also strengthened the position of automotive manufacturers. However, visibility on global GDP remains limited and uncertain.\nGlobal vehicle production levels: Global vehicle production increased by 1.3 percent in 2015. European vehicle production rose 4.1 percent from 2014 levels. North American vehicle production increased 3.6 percent, with positive growth in Mexico and the United States. Vehicle production in the Asia-Pacific region increased just under 1 percent in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015, down 19.3 percent.\nGlobal vehicle sales levels: Global vehicle sales increased by 1.8 percent in 2015. European vehicle sales rose 3.5 percent from 2014 levels. North American vehicles sales increased 6.3 percent, with positive growth in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Vehicle sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1.5 percent in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015 which was down 21.1 percent.\nPart replacement trends: The strength of our aftermarket business is influenced by several key drivers. These include the vehicle population (or \"parc\"), average vehicle age, fuel prices and vehicle distance traveled. The vehicle parc is estimated to have expanded in most major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, and Germany. Average vehicle ages also increased, despite growth in new vehicle sales, in most regions.\nRecent decline in oil prices: The recent decline in oil prices results in lower fuel prices for consumers. Lower fuel prices provide consumers with more discretionary income for vehicle repairs and tends to encourage more driving miles, which in turn accelerates wear on vehicle components, accelerating the need for replacements. Low fuel prices also encourage more vehicle sales, which increases demand for parts from OEMs.\nForeign currencies: Given the global nature of our operations, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates. During 2015, foreign currency fluctuations had a considerable effect on our reported earnings in U.S. dollars compared to 2014.\nStrategy:\nOur strategy is to develop and deliver leading technology, innovation, and service capabilities which results in market share expansion in the OE market and aftermarket. Our strategy is designed to create sustainable global profitable growth by leveraging existing and developing new economic advantages. This strategy consists of the following:\nExtending our global reach to support our OE and aftermarket customers, furthering our relationships with leading Asian OEs and strengthening market share with U.S. and European OEs.\nDuring 2015, we acquired TRW's valvetrain business, which adds a completely new product line to our product portfolio, and strengthens our position as a leading developer and supplier of core components for engines.\nDuring 2014, we completed the purchase of certain assets of the Honeywell brake component business and the Affinia chassis business. The Honeywell brake component acquisition included two recently established manufacturing facilities in China and Romania that substantially strengthened the manufacturing and engineering capabilities of our global braking portfolio.\nAssess acquisition and investment opportunities that provide product line expansion, technological advancements, geographic positioning, penetration of emerging markets (including India and China) and market share growth.\nIn addition to the TRW valvetrain acquisition during 2015, we also made investments in joint ventures in India, as well as entered into two new joint ventures, one in Thailand and one in China focused on automotive aftermarket vehicle repair business. We will be the preferred supplier to the China joint venture and will provide our broad portfolio of premium-branded automotive parts for distribution through a network of repair shops. These investments position the company to capitalize on the development of the independent aftermarket in the Asia Pacific region.\nLeverage the strength of our global aftermarket leading brand positions, product portfolio and range, marketing and selling expertise, and distribution and logistics capabilities.\nThe acquired of the Affinia chassis business serves leading U.S. aftermarket customers with chassis products and broadened our product offering and customer base while also providing operational synergies.\nDuring 2015, we executed on various marketing campaigns for our premium brands. We also launched a series of 'Tech First' initiatives to provide online, on-demand, and onsite technical training and support to vehicle repair technicians who use and install our products. This initiative included the opening of 'Garage Gurus,' a nationwide technical education network network consisting of 10 technical support centers and mobile training vans in major U.S. markets; a repair shop engagement program in France and Germany; and the opening of the company's first technical training and support center in China.\nAggressively pursue cost competitiveness in all business segments by continuing to drive productivity in existing operations, consolidating and relocating manufacturing operations to best cost countries, utilizing our strategic alliances, and rationalizing business resources and infrastructure.\nRestructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to our EMEA locations and were aimed at (1) the reshaping of the aftermarket distribution network, (2) reducing production complexities, and (3) reducing inefficiencies in indirect and fixed costs structures.\nWe assess individual opportunities to execute our strategy based upon estimated sales and margin growth, cost reduction potential, internal investment returns, and other criteria, and make investment decisions on a case-by-case basis. Opportunities meeting or exceeding benchmark return criteria may be undertaken through research and development activities, acquisitions, and other strategic alliances, or restructuring activities.\nOutlook\nWe expect to benefit from the effect of our synergistic acquisitions, strategic initiatives and restructuring actions initiated over the last several years through improved efficiencies and cost savings; as well as a reduction in the cash outlay and related costs directly associated with these actions. Incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division are expected to decline as the distribution centers reach full utilization. We also believe there are opportunities to reduce inventory levels, which increased as part of the ramp-up of these distribution centers. However, we expect further investments in our European and Asia Pacific distribution networks and information technology systems in 2016 and 2017.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on From 10K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United Sates ( U.S GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, our significant accounting policies have been disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes under Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\" We provide enhanced information that supplements such disclosures for accounting estimates when the estimate involves matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and different estimates or changes to an estimate could have a material effect on the reported financial position, changes in financial condition or results of operations.\nWhen more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that it considers to be the most appropriate given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Estimates are typically based upon historical experience, current trends, contractual documentation, and other information, as appropriate. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from those estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The following summarizes our critical accounting policies.\nPension Plans and Other Postemployment Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Our defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, and mortality and mortality improvement rates of plan participants.\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated in net actuarial gains and losses which are subject to amortization and expensed over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $532 million and $590 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. We expect to recognize amortization expense of $15 million in 2016.\nAssumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the end of a fiscal year directly affect the expense to be recognized in future periods. The primary assumptions affecting our accounting for employee benefits as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Long-term rate of return on plan assets: The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. While the development of the long-term rate of return on assets gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is designed to approximate a long-term prospective rate. The expected long-term rate of return used to calculate net periodic pension cost is 6.55% for U.S. plans and a weighted average of 3.52% for non-U.S. plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rate: The discount rate reflects the effective yield on high quality fixed income securities available in the marketplace as of the measurement date to settle pension and postemployment benefit obligations. The discount rate assumption is established at the measurement date. In the U.S., we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. The benefit obligation for pension plans in Belgium, France, and Germany represents 91% of the non-U.S. pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2015. The discount rates for plans in Belgium, France, and Germany are determined using a cash flow matching approach similar to the U.S. approach.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted-average discount rates used to calculate net periodic benefit cost for the 2015 and year-end obligations as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Postretirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used to calculate net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used to calculate benefit obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Health care cost trend: We review external data and our historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate.

Such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental remediation is estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based on current law and considers the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that, where applicable, other responsible parties will be able to fulfill their legal obligations and commitments. The process of estimating environmental remediation liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty as to what remediation and technology will be required, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and, if applicable, other responsible parties. In future periods, new laws or regulations, advances in remediation technologies and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimates. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nIn determining whether the fair value of asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\") can reasonably be estimated, we must determine if the obligation can be assessed in relation to the acquisition price of the related asset or if an active market exists to transfer the obligation. If the obligation cannot be assessed in connection with an acquisition price and if no market exists for the transfer of the obligation, we must determine if it has sufficient information upon which to estimate the obligation using expected present value techniques. This determination requires us to estimate the range of settlement dates and the potential methods of settlement, and then to assign the probabilities to the various potential settlement dates and methods. The majority of the identified ARO liabilities involve Asbestos related cleanup. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details. We cannot ensure that ARO requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Investments in Affiliates and Expected Useful Lives\nWe monitor our long-lived and definite lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows, including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Even if an impairment charge is not required, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets. We estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments, and review of appraisals. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) future production estimates; (2) customer preferences and decisions; (3) product pricing; (4) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (5) product life / business retention. Any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values, which could materially effect our future results of operations and financial condition. We believe the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We perform impairment assessments at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount (step 1), goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step is to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess. Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis that have the most significant effect on the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units are the weighted average cost of capital and revenue growth-rates.\nWe perform an annual impairment analysis of our trademarks and brand names annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. We perform quantitative assessment estimating fair values based upon the prospective stream of hypothetical after-tax royalty cost savings discounted at rates that reflect the rates of return appropriate for these intangible assets. Our trademarks and brand names further broken down by product line. The primary, and most sensitive, input utilized in determining the fair values of trademarks and brand names is sales by product line. We Company performed a sensitivity analysis on its trademarks and brand names and determined that a one percentage point decrease in its projected future sales growth rates within each aftermarket product line would result in a $1 million impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods.\nWhen establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future sources of taxable income such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards\u201d and tax planning strategies.\u201d A tax planning strategy is defined as an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets.\u201d In the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability. Changes in our estimates, due to unforeseen events or otherwise, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We use a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax\npositions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nNon-GAAP Measures:\nManagement utilizes Operational EBITDA as the key performance measure of segment profitability and uses the measure in its financial and operational decision making processes; for internal reporting; and for planning and forecasting purposes to effectively allocate resources. Operational EBIDTA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), as adjusted for additional amounts. Examples of these adjustments include impairment charges related to goodwill, other long-lived assets and investments; restructuring charges; certain gains or losses on the settlement/extinguishment of obligations; and receivable financing charges. During 2015, we modified our definition of Operational EBITDA to adjust for financing charges related to certain receivable financing programs. Comparable periods have been adjusted to conform to this definition.\nOperational EBITDA presents a performance measure exclusive of capital structure and the method by which net assets were acquired, disposed of, or financed. Management believes this measure provides additional transparency into its core operations and is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments and reporting units. The measure also allows management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among operating segments.\nOperational EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure to Operational EBITDA that is in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Operational EBITDA, as determined and measured by Federal Mogul, should not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read in connection with Items 1, 3 and 7A of this Form 10-K, as well as Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1.A. Risk Factors.\u201d These items provide additional relevant information regarding the business, our strategy, and the various industry dynamics in the OE market and the aftermarket which have a direct and significant effect on our results of operations, as well as the risks associated with our business.\nConsolidated Results:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nSales: Consolidated net sales increased by $102 million, or 1.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase over 2014 sales was primarily driven by a 10% increase in sales volumes of $743 million (which included a $657 million benefit from acquisitions) and was substantially offset by a $642 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of Sales: Cost of products sold increased by $85 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by a $645 million in incremental costs related to higher sales volumes attributable to acquisitions, and partly to volumes related to organic growth. This was substantially offset by the $529 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange and $31 million of savings from net performance. Net performance gains were burdened by incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division and strategic initiatives within both divisions.\nGross Profit: Gross profit as a percentage of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 14.5% compared to 14.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit increased by $17 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable effects of higher sales volumes (net of changes in mix) of $98 million, which included the effect from acquisitions, $32 million favorable effects of net performance. These favorable effects were substantially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as a percentage of sales, was 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 10.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase of $18 million is primarily attributable to the addition of SG&A expenses associated with acquisitions, partially offset by foreign exchange. Included in SG&A was a $7 million charge related to the bankruptcy of one of our aftermarket customers.\nResearch and development ( R&D\u201d) costs, including product and validation costs, of $189 million and $192 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nGoodwill and intangible impairment expense, net: Goodwill and intangible asset impairments decreased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we impaired $50 million and $44 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts and Powertrain segments. During 2014, we impaired $120 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts segment.\nRestructuring charges and asset impairments: Restructuring charges and asset impairments increased by $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was driven by overall higher severance and other charges of $3 million, primarily related to our overall restructuring efforts in Europe, and an increase in asset impairments of $8 million, primarily related to an impairment of assets held for sale during 2015.\nAmortization expense: Amortization expense increased by $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we completed the acquisition of TRW's valvetrain business thereby adding $107 million of definite lived intangible assets which contributed to the increase in amortization expense.\nEquity earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates: Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased by $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by increased earnings at a number of our nonconsolidated affiliates, including an initial investment in two new affiliates,\nand the sale of a nonconsolidated affiliate that incurred a loss of $1 million in 2014.\nLoss on Debt extinguishment: Loss on Debt extinguishment was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we entered into a new tranche B term loan facility and a new tranche C term loan facility and repaid our existing outstanding indebtedness under previous facilities. In conjunction with the transaction, we recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $24 million, including the write-off of a portion of related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nInterest Expense, Net: Net interest expense was $138 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the realization of higher interest rates for the full year, and increased borrowings under the Replacement Revolving Facility, offset by lower amortization costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net: Other expense, net was $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the decrease is a $6 million reduction in the amount of segmentation costs recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax (expense) / benefit: For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax expense of $30 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $81 million, compared to income tax expense of $56 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax losses with no tax benefits, partially offset by pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be not more likely than not to be realized and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be not more likely than not to be realized, income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to offsetting valuation allowance release, partially offset by pre-tax losses with no tax benefits and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nGain (loss) from discontinued operation, net of tax: During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $7 million adjustment (no income tax effect) which is included in Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within the consolidated statement of operations related to a 2013 divestiture of our fuel pump business.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nSales: Consolidated net sales increased by $531 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase over 2013 sales was primarily driven by a 9% increase in sales volumes resulting from a $356 million benefit from acquisitions, higher demand, and organic growth, together totaling $612 million, which was partially offset by a $51 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of Sales: Cost of products sold increased by $494 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $505 million increase in costs primarily related to higher sales volumes, which is partly attributable to acquisitions, and $32 million of unfavorable net performance. These costs were partially offset by the $43 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nGross Profit: Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 14.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 15.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013. While gross profit increased by $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased sales volumes, the gross profit margin decreased primarily due to: changes in mix and pricing, and increases to strategic initiatives and unfavorable productivity.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as a percentage of sales, was 10.6% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase of $57 million is primarily attributable to the addition of SG&A expenses associated with acquisitions. Included in SG&A were research and development ( R&D\u201d) costs, including product and validation costs, of $192 million and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.\nGoodwill and intangible impairment expense, net: Goodwill and intangible asset impairments increased by $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. During 2014, we impaired $120 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts segment.\nInterest Expense, Net: Net interest expense was $120 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to the increased interest rates after the refinancing of our term loans in April 2014.\nRestructuring charges and asset impairments: Restructuring charges and asset impairments increased by $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to higher severance and other charges of $46 million, primarily related to our overall restructuring efforts in Europe, an increase in asset impairments of $16 million, which included a $5 million impairment of a nonconsolidated affiliate, partially offset by an OPEB curtailment gain recorded in 2013 that was related to a restructuring action.\nAmortization expense: Amortization expense increased by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. During 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain Affinia assets and DZV bearings operations thereby adding $52 million of definite lived intangible assets which contributed to the increase in amortization expense.\nEquity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates: Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased by $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by increased earnings at nonconsolidated affiliates located in the Asia and EMEA regions.\nLoss on Debt extinguishment: Loss on Debt extinguishment was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we entered into a new tranche B term loan facility and a new tranche C term loan facility and repaid our existing outstanding indebtedness under previous facilities. In conjunction with the transaction, we recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $24 million, including the write-off of a portion of related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nOther Expense, Net: Other expense, net was $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be not more likely than not to be realized, income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to\noffsetting valuation allowance release, partially offset by pre-tax losses with no tax benefits and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment with no tax benefit and pre-tax losses with no tax benefit, partially offset by pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to

driven by higher inventory levels required to support the realignment of the aftermarket distribution footprint); higher cash interest payments of $22 million; lower cash dividends from

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business: We are a leading global supplier of a broad range of components, accessories, and systems to the automotive, small engine, heavy-duty, marine, railroad, agricultural, off-road, aerospace and energy, industrial, and transport markets, including customers in both the original equipment manufacturers ( OEM\u201d) and servicers ( OES\u201d) (collectively OE\u201d) market and the replacement market ( aftermarket\u201d). Our customers include the world's largest automotive OEs, and major distributors and retailers in the independent aftermarket.\nWe operate with two end-customer focused business segments. The Powertrain segment focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy duty and industrial applications. Powertrain operates manufacturing facilities in 19 countries and derived 35% of its 2015 OE sales in North America, 46% in Europe, the Middle-East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), and 19% in the rest of the world (\"Rest of World\" or \"ROW\"). The Motorparts segment sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket including more than 20 globally-recognized brands. We also serve OEMs with products including braking, wipers, and a limited range of chassis components. Motorparts operates manufacturing sites in 15 countries and distribution centers and warehouses in 13 countries. In 2015, Motorparts derived 56% of its sales in North America, 37% in EMEA, and 7% in Rest of World.\nTermination of Spin-off: On January 15, 2016, we announced the termination of the previously announced spin-off of the Motorparts division. We will continue to operate with two separate, independent businesses with separate CEOs who will each report directly to our board of directors. The separate businesses more effectively serve their unique markets and allow each operating business to pursue its business strategy and more quickly react to its unique market conditions.\nFinancial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015: Consolidated net sales were $7,419 million, an increase of $102 million, or 1.4%. The increase was primarily driven by a 10% increase in sales volumes of $734 million (which included a $657 million benefit from acquisitions), which was substantially offset by the $642 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of products sold was $6,345 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $85 million, or 1%. The increase was driven by $645 million in incremental costs related to higher sales volumes attributable to acquisitions, and partly to volumes related to organic growth. This was substantially offset by the $529 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange and $31 million of savings from net performance. Net performance gains were burdened by incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division and strategic initiatives within both divisions.\nGross profit increased by $17 million to $1,074 million, or 14.5% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,057 million, or 14.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of $98 million, which included the effect of acquisitions, and the $32 million favorable effect of performance, which was offset by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2015:\n \u2022 Net loss attributable to Federal-Mogul for the year-ended December 31, 2015 was $110 million, which included goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $94 million, and restructuring charges and asset impairments of $121 million. \n \u2022 We impaired $50 million and $44 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts and Powertrain segments, respectively. \n \u2022 Restructuring charges and asset impairments were comprised of $62 million related to the Powertrain segment and $59 million related to the Motorparts segment. This charge includes $89 million of costs related to severance and other charges primarily focused on reducing inefficiencies in the cost structure of recent acquisitions and the EMEA aftermarket. \n \u2022 Total debt, including short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt, increased by $372 million. This was attributable to the additional strategic investments made during 2015 including the acquisition of TRW's valvetrain business, which was funded primarily by our revolving line of credit. We had $194 million of cash and $170 million of availability under our credit facilities at December 31, 2015. \nRecent Trends and Market Conditions:\nOur business and operating results are affected by the relative strength of:\nGeneral economic conditions: Our OE business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive sales depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by three primary factors including: the number of vehicles in operation; the average age of vehicles; and vehicle usage trends (primarily distance traveled).\nEarly estimates of global GDP indicate a 2.4 percent increase in 2015. Major factors contributing to this rate of growth include generally stable conditions in developed regions and slowing growth in emerging markets. While the Chinese economic growth rate slowed from previous years, GDP estimates indicate 6.9 percent growth in 2015. Full-year GDP estimates for the European Union, Japan, and the United States are 1.5, 0.8 and 2.5 percent, respectively. Economic conditions in key regions remain mixed. However, the combination of low interest rates and declining fuel prices continues to support vehicle sales and production globally. Declining commodity prices have also strengthened the position of automotive manufacturers. However, visibility on global GDP remains limited and uncertain.\nGlobal vehicle production levels: Global vehicle production increased by 1.3 percent in 2015. European vehicle production rose 4.1 percent from 2014 levels. North American vehicle production increased 3.6 percent, with positive growth in Mexico and the United States. Vehicle production in the Asia-Pacific region increased just under 1 percent in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015, down 19.3 percent.\nGlobal vehicle sales levels: Global vehicle sales increased by 1.8 percent in 2015. European vehicle sales rose 3.5 percent from 2014 levels. North American vehicles sales increased 6.3 percent, with positive growth in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Vehicle sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1.5 percent in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015 which was down 21.1 percent.\nPart replacement trends: The strength of our aftermarket business is influenced by several key drivers. These include the vehicle population (or \"parc\"), average vehicle age, fuel prices and vehicle distance traveled. The vehicle parc is estimated to have expanded in most major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, and Germany. Average vehicle ages also increased, despite growth in new vehicle sales, in most regions.\nRecent decline in oil prices: The recent decline in oil prices results in lower fuel prices for consumers. Lower fuel prices provide consumers with more discretionary income for vehicle repairs and tends to encourage more driving miles, which in turn accelerates wear on vehicle components, accelerating the need for replacements. Low fuel prices also encourage more vehicle sales, which increases demand for parts from OEMs.\nForeign currencies: Given the global nature of our operations, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates. During 2015, foreign currency fluctuations had a considerable effect on our reported earnings in U.S. dollars compared to 2014.\nStrategy:\nOur strategy is to develop and deliver leading technology, innovation, and service capabilities which results in market share expansion in the OE market and aftermarket. Our strategy is designed to create sustainable global profitable growth by leveraging existing and developing new economic advantages. This strategy consists of the following:\nExtending our global reach to support our OE and aftermarket customers, furthering our relationships with leading Asian OEs and strengthening market share with U.S. and European OEs.\nDuring 2015, we acquired TRW's valvetrain business, which adds a completely new product line to our product portfolio, and strengthens our position as a leading developer and supplier of core components for engines.\nDuring 2014, we completed the purchase of certain assets of the Honeywell brake component business and the Affinia chassis business. The Honeywell brake component acquisition included two recently established manufacturing facilities in China and Romania that substantially strengthened the manufacturing and engineering capabilities of our global braking portfolio.\nAssess acquisition and investment opportunities that provide product line expansion, technological advancements, geographic positioning, penetration of emerging markets (including India and China) and market share growth.\nIn addition to the TRW valvetrain acquisition during 2015, we also made investments in joint ventures in India, as well as entered into two new joint ventures, one in Thailand and one in China focused on automotive aftermarket vehicle repair business. We will be the preferred supplier to the China joint venture and will provide our broad portfolio of premium-branded automotive parts for distribution through a network of repair shops. These investments position the company to capitalize on the development of the independent aftermarket in the Asia Pacific region.\nLeverage the strength of our global aftermarket leading brand positions, product portfolio and range, marketing and selling expertise, and distribution and logistics capabilities.\nThe acquired of the Affinia chassis business serves leading U.S. aftermarket customers with chassis products and broadened our product offering and customer base while also providing operational synergies.\nDuring 2015, we executed on various marketing campaigns for our premium brands. We also launched a series of 'Tech First' initiatives to provide online, on-demand, and onsite technical training and support to vehicle repair technicians who use and install our products. This initiative included the opening of 'Garage Gurus,' a nationwide technical education network network consisting of 10 technical support centers and mobile training vans in major U.S. markets; a repair shop engagement program in France and Germany; and the opening of the company's first technical training and support center in China.\nAggressively pursue cost competitiveness in all business segments by continuing to drive productivity in existing operations, consolidating and relocating manufacturing operations to best cost countries, utilizing our strategic alliances, and rationalizing business resources and infrastructure.\nRestructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to our EMEA locations and were aimed at (1) the reshaping of the aftermarket distribution network, (2) reducing production complexities, and (3) reducing inefficiencies in indirect and fixed costs structures.\nWe assess individual opportunities to execute our strategy based upon estimated sales and margin growth, cost reduction potential, internal investment returns, and other criteria, and make investment decisions on a case-by-case basis. Opportunities meeting or exceeding benchmark return criteria may be undertaken through research and development activities, acquisitions, and other strategic alliances, or restructuring activities.\nOutlook\nWe expect to benefit from the effect of our synergistic acquisitions, strategic initiatives and restructuring actions initiated over the last several years through improved efficiencies and cost savings; as well as a reduction in the cash outlay and related costs directly associated with these actions. Incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division are expected to decline as the distribution centers reach full utilization. We also believe there are opportunities to reduce inventory levels, which increased as part of the ramp-up of these distribution centers. However, we expect further investments in our European and Asia Pacific distribution networks and information technology systems in 2016 and 2017.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on From 10K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United Sates ( U.S GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, our significant accounting policies have been disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes under Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\" We provide enhanced information that supplements such disclosures for accounting estimates when the estimate involves matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and different estimates or changes to an estimate could have a material effect on the reported financial position, changes in financial condition or results of operations.\nWhen more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that it considers to be the most appropriate given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Estimates are typically based upon historical experience, current trends, contractual documentation, and other information, as appropriate. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from those estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The following summarizes our critical accounting policies.\nPension Plans and Other Postemployment Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Our defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, and mortality and mortality improvement rates of plan participants.\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated in net actuarial gains and losses which are subject to amortization and expensed over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $532 million and $590 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. We expect to recognize amortization expense of $15 million in 2016.\nAssumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the end of a fiscal year directly affect the expense to be recognized in future periods. The primary assumptions affecting our accounting for employee benefits as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 Long-term rate of return on plan assets: The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. While the development of the long-term rate of return on assets gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is designed to approximate a long-term prospective rate. The expected long-term rate of return used to calculate net periodic pension cost is 6.55% for U.S. plans and a weighted average of 3.52% for non-U.S. plans. \n \u2022 Discount rate: The discount rate reflects the effective yield on high quality fixed income securities available in the marketplace as of the measurement date to settle pension and postemployment benefit obligations. The discount rate assumption is established at the measurement date. In the U.S., we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. The benefit obligation for pension plans in Belgium, France, and Germany represents 91% of the non-U.S. pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2015. The discount rates for plans in Belgium, France, and Germany are determined using a cash flow matching approach similar to the U.S. approach. \nThe weighted-average discount rates used to calculate net periodic benefit cost for the 2015 and year-end obligations as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Postretirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used to calculate net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used to calculate benefit obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Health care cost trend: We review external data and our historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure next year's postretirement health care benefits is 6.97% for both health care and drug costs, both declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.00% in 2022. \n \u2022 Mortality Assumptions: We have reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the Society of Actuaries in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and determined our current assumptions are appropriate to measure our December 31, 2015 U.S. pension plans' benefit obligations. \nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d) and associated expense. The changes in these assumptions have no effect on our funding requirements.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>Other Postretirement\nBenefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United States Plans\n</td> <td>Non-U.S. Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nin 2016\nPension\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nin\nPBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2016 Pension\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nin\nPBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nin 2016\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nin\nPBO\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Millions of Dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point (\"bp\") decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 bp increase in discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 bp decrease in return on assets rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 bp increase in return on assets rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assumed health care trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for non-pension plans.

Such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental remediation is estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based on current law and considers the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that, where applicable, other responsible parties will be able to fulfill their legal obligations and commitments. The process of estimating environmental remediation liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty as to what remediation and technology will be required, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and, if applicable, other responsible parties. In future periods, new laws or regulations, advances in remediation technologies and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimates. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nIn determining whether the fair value of asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\") can reasonably be estimated, we must determine if the obligation can be assessed in relation to the acquisition price of the related asset or if an active market exists to transfer the obligation. If the obligation cannot be assessed in connection with an acquisition price and if no market exists for the transfer of the obligation, we must determine if it has sufficient information upon which to estimate the obligation using expected present value techniques. This determination requires us to estimate the range of settlement dates and the potential methods of settlement, and then to assign the probabilities to the various potential settlement dates and methods. The majority of the identified ARO liabilities involve Asbestos related cleanup. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details. We cannot ensure that ARO requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Investments in Affiliates and Expected Useful Lives\nWe monitor our long-lived and definite lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows, including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Even if an impairment charge is not required, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets. We estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments, and review of appraisals. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) future production estimates; (2) customer preferences and decisions; (3) product pricing; (4) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (5) product life / business retention. Any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values, which could materially effect our future results of operations and financial condition. We believe the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We perform impairment assessments at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount (step 1), goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step is to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess. Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis that have the most significant effect on the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units are the weighted average cost of capital and revenue growth-rates.\nWe perform an annual impairment analysis of our trademarks and brand names annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. We perform quantitative assessment estimating fair values based upon the prospective stream of hypothetical after-tax royalty cost savings discounted at rates that reflect the rates of return appropriate for these intangible assets. Our trademarks and brand names further broken down by product line. The primary, and most sensitive, input utilized in determining the fair values of trademarks and brand names is sales by product line. We Company performed a sensitivity analysis on its trademarks and brand names and determined that a one percentage point decrease in its projected future sales growth rates within each aftermarket product line would result in a $1 million impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods.\nWhen establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future sources of taxable income such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards\u201d and tax planning strategies.\u201d A tax planning strategy is defined as an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets.\u201d In the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability. Changes in our estimates, due to unforeseen events or otherwise, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We use a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax\npositions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nNon-GAAP Measures:\nManagement utilizes Operational EBITDA as the key performance measure of segment profitability and uses the measure in its financial and operational decision making processes; for internal reporting; and for planning and forecasting purposes to effectively allocate resources. Operational EBIDTA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), as adjusted for additional amounts. Examples of these adjustments include impairment charges related to goodwill, other long-lived assets and investments; restructuring charges; certain gains or losses on the settlement/extinguishment of obligations; and receivable financing charges. During 2015, we modified our definition of Operational EBITDA to adjust for financing charges related to certain receivable financing programs. Comparable periods have been adjusted to conform to this definition.\nOperational EBITDA presents a performance measure exclusive of capital structure and the method by which net assets were acquired, disposed of, or financed. Management believes this measure provides additional transparency into its core operations and is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments and reporting units. The measure also allows management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among operating segments.\nOperational EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure to Operational EBITDA that is in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Operational EBITDA, as determined and measured by Federal Mogul, should not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read in connection with Items 1, 3 and 7A of this Form 10-K, as well as Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1.A. Risk Factors.\u201d These items provide additional relevant information regarding the business, our strategy, and the various industry dynamics in the OE market and the aftermarket which have a direct and significant effect on our results of operations, as well as the risks associated with our business.\nConsolidated Results:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nSales: Consolidated net sales increased by $102 million, or 1.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase over 2014 sales was primarily driven by a 10% increase in sales volumes of $743 million (which included a $657 million benefit from acquisitions) and was substantially offset by a $642 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of Sales: Cost of products sold increased by $85 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by a $645 million in incremental costs related to higher sales volumes attributable to acquisitions, and partly to volumes related to organic growth. This was substantially offset by the $529 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange and $31 million of savings from net performance. Net performance gains were burdened by incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division and strategic initiatives within both divisions.\nGross Profit: Gross profit as a percentage of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 14.5% compared to 14.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit increased by $17 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable effects of higher sales volumes (net of changes in mix) of $98 million, which included the effect from acquisitions, $32 million favorable effects of net performance. These favorable effects were substantially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as a percentage of sales, was 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 10.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase of $18 million is primarily attributable to the addition of SG&A expenses associated with acquisitions, partially offset by foreign exchange. Included in SG&A was a $7 million charge related to the bankruptcy of one of our aftermarket customers.\nResearch and development ( R&D\u201d) costs, including product and validation costs, of $189 million and $192 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nGoodwill and intangible impairment expense, net: Goodwill and intangible asset impairments decreased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we impaired $50 million and $44 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts and Powertrain segments. During 2014, we impaired $120 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts segment.\nRestructuring charges and asset impairments: Restructuring charges and asset impairments increased by $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was driven by overall higher severance and other charges of $3 million, primarily related to our overall restructuring efforts in Europe, and an increase in asset impairments of $8 million, primarily related to an impairment of assets held for sale during 2015.\nAmortization expense: Amortization expense increased by $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we completed the acquisition of TRW's valvetrain business thereby adding $107 million of definite lived intangible assets which contributed to the increase in amortization expense.\nEquity earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates: Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased by $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by increased earnings at a number of our nonconsolidated affiliates, including an initial investment in two new affiliates,\nand the sale of a nonconsolidated affiliate that incurred a loss of $1 million in 2014.\nLoss on Debt extinguishment: Loss on Debt extinguishment was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we entered into a new tranche B term loan facility and a new tranche C term loan facility and repaid our existing outstanding indebtedness under previous facilities. In conjunction with the transaction, we recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $24 million, including the write-off of a portion of related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nInterest Expense, Net: Net interest expense was $138 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the realization of higher interest rates for the full year, and increased borrowings under the Replacement Revolving Facility, offset by lower amortization costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net: Other expense, net was $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the decrease is a $6 million reduction in the amount of segmentation costs recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax (expense) / benefit: For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax expense of $30 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $81 million, compared to income tax expense of $56 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax losses with no tax benefits, partially offset by pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be not more likely than not to be realized and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be not more likely than not to be realized, income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to offsetting valuation allowance release, partially offset by pre-tax losses with no tax benefits and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nGain (loss) from discontinued operation, net of tax: During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $7 million adjustment (no income tax effect) which is included in Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within the consolidated statement of operations related to a 2013 divestiture of our fuel pump business.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nSales: Consolidated net sales increased by $531 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase over 2013 sales was primarily driven by a 9% increase in sales volumes resulting from a $356 million benefit from acquisitions, higher demand, and organic growth, together totaling $612 million, which was partially offset by a $51 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of Sales: Cost of products sold increased by $494 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $505 million increase in costs primarily related to higher sales volumes, which is partly attributable to acquisitions, and $32 million of unfavorable net performance. These costs were partially offset by the $43 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nGross Profit: Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 14.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 15.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013. While gross profit increased by $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased sales volumes, the gross profit margin decreased primarily due to: changes in mix and pricing, and increases to strategic initiatives and unfavorable productivity.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as a percentage of sales, was 10.6% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase of $57 million is primarily attributable to the addition of SG&A expenses associated with acquisitions. Included in SG&A were research and development ( R&D\u201d) costs, including product and validation costs, of $192 million and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.\nGoodwill and intangible impairment expense, net: Goodwill and intangible asset impairments increased by $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. During 2014, we impaired $120 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts segment.\nInterest Expense, Net: Net interest expense was $120 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to the increased interest rates after the refinancing of our term loans in April 2014.\nRestructuring charges and asset impairments: Restructuring charges and asset impairments increased by $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to higher severance and other charges of $46 million, primarily related to our overall restructuring efforts in Europe, an increase in asset impairments of $16 million, which included a $5 million impairment of a nonconsolidated affiliate, partially offset by an OPEB curtailment gain recorded in 2013 that was related to a restructuring action.\nAmortization expense: Amortization expense increased by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. During 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain Affinia assets and DZV bearings operations thereby adding $52 million of definite lived intangible assets which contributed to the increase in amortization expense.\nEquity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates: Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased by $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by increased earnings at nonconsolidated affiliates located in the Asia and EMEA regions.\nLoss on Debt extinguishment: Loss on Debt extinguishment was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we entered into a new tranche B term loan facility and a new tranche C term loan facility and repaid our existing outstanding indebtedness under previous facilities.

million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be

benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment with no tax benefit and pre-tax losses with no tax benefit, partially offset by pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to

Motorparts sales to Pep Boys in 2015 were approximately $5 million.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Company announced its receipt of a proposal from its majority shareholder, IEP to purchase the shares of Federal-Mogul common stock not owned by IEP in a merger transaction.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business: We are a leading global supplier of a broad range of components, accessories, and systems to the automotive, small engine, heavy-duty, marine, railroad, agricultural, off-road, aerospace and energy, industrial, and transport markets, including customers in both the original equipment manufacturers ( OEM\u201d) and servicers ( OES\u201d) (collectively OE\u201d) market and the replacement market ( aftermarket\u201d). Our customers include the world's largest automotive OEs, and major distributors and retailers in the independent aftermarket.\nWe operate with two end-customer focused business segments. The Powertrain segment focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy duty and industrial applications. Powertrain operates manufacturing facilities in 19 countries and derived 35% of its 2015 OE sales in North America, 46% in Europe, the Middle-East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), and 19% in the rest of the world (\"Rest of World\" or \"ROW\"). The Motorparts segment sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket including more than 20 globally-recognized brands. We also serve OEMs with products including braking, wipers, and a limited range of chassis components. Motorparts operates manufacturing sites in 15 countries and distribution centers and warehouses in 13 countries. In 2015, Motorparts derived 56% of its sales in North America, 37% in EMEA, and 7% in Rest of World.\nTermination of Spin-off: On January 15, 2016, we announced the termination of the previously announced spin-off of the Motorparts division. We will continue to operate with two separate, independent businesses with separate CEOs who will each report directly to our board of directors. The separate businesses more effectively serve their unique markets and allow each operating business to pursue its business strategy and more quickly react to its unique market conditions.\nFinancial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015: Consolidated net sales were $7,419 million, an increase of $102 million, or 1.4%. The increase was primarily driven by a 10% increase in sales volumes of $734 million (which included a $657 million benefit from acquisitions), which was substantially offset by the $642 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of products sold was $6,345 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $85 million, or 1%. The increase was driven by $645 million in incremental costs related to higher sales volumes attributable to acquisitions, and partly to volumes related to organic growth. This was substantially offset by the $529 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange and $31 million of savings from net performance. Net performance gains were burdened by incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division and strategic initiatives within both divisions.\nGross profit increased by $17 million to $1,074 million, or 14.5% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,057 million, or 14.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of $98 million, which included the effect of acquisitions, and the $32 million favorable effect of performance, which was offset by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2015:\n \u2022 Net loss attributable to Federal-Mogul for the year-ended December 31, 2015 was $110 million, which included goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $94 million, and restructuring charges and asset impairments of $121 million. \n \u2022 We impaired $50 million and $44 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts and Powertrain segments, respectively. \n \u2022 Restructuring charges and asset impairments were comprised of $62 million related to the Powertrain segment and $59 million related to the Motorparts segment. This charge includes $89 million of costs related to severance and other charges primarily focused on reducing inefficiencies in the cost structure of recent acquisitions and the EMEA aftermarket. \n \u2022 Total debt, including short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt, increased by $372 million. This was attributable to the additional strategic investments made during 2015 including the acquisition of TRW's valvetrain business, which was funded primarily by our revolving line of credit. We had $194 million of cash and $170 million of availability under our credit facilities at December 31, 2015. \nRecent Trends and Market Conditions:\nOur business and operating results are affected by the relative strength of:\nGeneral economic conditions: Our OE business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive sales depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by three primary factors including: the number of vehicles in operation; the average age of vehicles; and vehicle usage trends (primarily distance traveled).\nEarly estimates of global GDP indicate a 2.4 percent increase in 2015. Major factors contributing to this rate of growth include generally stable conditions in developed regions and slowing growth in emerging markets. While the Chinese economic growth rate slowed from previous years, GDP estimates indicate 6.9 percent growth in 2015. Full-year GDP estimates for the European Union, Japan, and the United States are 1.5, 0.8 and 2.5 percent, respectively. Economic conditions in key regions remain mixed. However, the combination of low interest rates and declining fuel prices continues to support vehicle sales and production globally. Declining commodity prices have also strengthened the position of automotive manufacturers. However, visibility on global GDP remains limited and uncertain.\nGlobal vehicle production levels: Global vehicle production increased by 1.3 percent in 2015. European vehicle production rose 4.1 percent from 2014 levels. North American vehicle production increased 3.6 percent, with positive growth in Mexico and the United States. Vehicle production in the Asia-Pacific region increased just under 1 percent in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015, down 19.3 percent.\nGlobal vehicle sales levels: Global vehicle sales increased by 1.8 percent in 2015. European vehicle sales rose 3.5 percent from 2014 levels. North American vehicles sales increased 6.3 percent, with positive growth in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Vehicle sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1.5 percent in 2015, reaching another record high. Among the major regions, only South America posted a decline in 2015 which was down 21.1 percent.\nPart replacement trends: The strength of our aftermarket business is influenced by several key drivers. These include the vehicle population (or \"parc\"), average vehicle age, fuel prices and vehicle distance traveled. The vehicle parc is estimated to have expanded in most major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, and Germany. Average vehicle ages also increased, despite growth in new vehicle sales, in most regions.\nRecent decline in oil prices: The recent decline in oil prices results in lower fuel prices for consumers. Lower fuel prices provide consumers with more discretionary income for vehicle repairs and tends to encourage more driving miles, which in turn accelerates wear on vehicle components, accelerating the need for replacements. Low fuel prices also encourage more vehicle sales, which increases demand for parts from OEMs.\nForeign currencies: Given the global nature of our operations, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates. During 2015, foreign currency fluctuations had a considerable effect on our reported earnings in U.S. dollars compared to 2014.\nStrategy:\nOur strategy is to develop and deliver leading technology, innovation, and service capabilities which results in market share expansion in the OE market and aftermarket. Our strategy is designed to create sustainable global profitable growth by leveraging existing and developing new economic advantages. This strategy consists of the following:\nExtending our global reach to support our OE and aftermarket customers, furthering our relationships with leading Asian OEs and strengthening market share with U.S. and European OEs.\nDuring 2015, we acquired TRW's valvetrain business, which adds a completely new product line to our product portfolio, and strengthens our position as a leading developer and supplier of core components for engines.\nDuring 2014, we completed the purchase of certain assets of the Honeywell brake component business and the Affinia chassis business. The Honeywell brake component acquisition included two recently established manufacturing facilities in China and Romania that substantially strengthened the manufacturing and engineering capabilities of our global braking portfolio.\nAssess acquisition and investment opportunities that provide product line expansion, technological advancements, geographic positioning, penetration of emerging markets (including India and China) and market share growth.\nIn addition to the TRW valvetrain acquisition during 2015, we also made investments in joint ventures in India, as well as entered into two new joint ventures, one in Thailand and one in China focused on automotive aftermarket vehicle repair business. We will be the preferred supplier to the China joint venture and will provide our broad portfolio of premium-branded automotive parts for distribution through a network of repair shops. These investments position the company to capitalize on the development of the independent aftermarket in the Asia Pacific region.\nLeverage the strength of our global aftermarket leading brand positions, product portfolio and range, marketing and selling expertise, and distribution and logistics capabilities.\nThe acquired of the Affinia chassis business serves leading U.S. aftermarket customers with chassis products and broadened our product offering and customer base while also providing operational synergies.\nDuring 2015, we executed on various marketing campaigns for our premium brands. We also launched a series of 'Tech First' initiatives to provide online, on-demand, and onsite technical training and support to vehicle repair technicians who use and install our products. This initiative included the opening of 'Garage Gurus,' a nationwide technical education network network consisting of 10 technical support centers and mobile training vans in major U.S. markets; a repair shop engagement program in France and Germany; and the opening of the company's first technical training and support center in China.\nAggressively pursue cost competitiveness in all business segments by continuing to drive productivity in existing operations, consolidating and relocating manufacturing operations to best cost countries, utilizing our strategic alliances, and rationalizing business resources and infrastructure.\nRestructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to our EMEA locations and were aimed at (1) the reshaping of the aftermarket distribution network, (2) reducing production complexities, and (3) reducing inefficiencies in indirect and fixed costs structures.\nWe assess individual opportunities to execute our strategy based upon estimated sales and margin growth, cost reduction potential, internal investment returns, and other criteria, and make investment decisions on a case-by-case basis. Opportunities meeting or exceeding benchmark return criteria may be undertaken through research and development activities, acquisitions, and other strategic alliances, or restructuring activities.\nOutlook\nWe expect to benefit from the effect of our synergistic acquisitions, strategic initiatives and restructuring actions initiated over the last several years through improved efficiencies and cost savings; as well as a reduction in the cash outlay and related costs directly associated with these actions. Incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division are expected to decline as the distribution centers reach full utilization. We also believe there are opportunities to reduce inventory levels, which increased as part of the ramp-up of these distribution centers. However, we expect further investments in our European and Asia Pacific distribution networks and information technology systems in 2016 and 2017.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on From 10K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United Sates ( U.S GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, our significant accounting policies have been disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes under Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\" We provide enhanced information that supplements such disclosures for accounting estimates when the estimate involves matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and different estimates or changes to an estimate could have a material effect on the reported financial position, changes in financial condition or results of operations.\nWhen more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that it considers to be the most appropriate given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Estimates are typically based upon historical experience, current trends, contractual documentation, and other information, as appropriate. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from those estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The following summarizes our critical accounting policies.\nPension Plans and Other Postemployment Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Our defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, and mortality and mortality improvement rates of plan participants.\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated in net actuarial gains and losses which are subject to amortization and expensed over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $532 million and $590 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. We expect to recognize amortization expense of $15 million in 2016.\nAssumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the end of a fiscal year directly affect the expense to be recognized in future periods. The primary assumptions affecting our accounting for employee benefits as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 Long-term rate of return on plan assets: The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. While the development of the long-term rate of return on assets gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is designed to approximate a long-term prospective rate. The expected long-term rate of return used to calculate net periodic pension cost is 6.55% for U.S. plans and a weighted average of 3.52% for non-U.S. plans. \n \u2022 Discount rate: The discount rate reflects the effective yield on high quality fixed income securities available in the marketplace as of the measurement date to settle pension and postemployment benefit obligations. The discount rate assumption is established at the measurement date. In the U.S., we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. The benefit obligation for pension plans in Belgium, France, and Germany represents 91% of the non-U.S. pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2015. The discount rates for plans in Belgium, France, and Germany are determined using a cash flow matching approach similar to the U.S. approach. \nThe weighted-average discount rates used to calculate net periodic benefit cost for the 2015 and year-end obligations as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\n\n \u2022 Health care cost trend: We review external data and our historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure next year's postretirement health care benefits is 6.97% for both health care and drug costs, both declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.00% in 2022. \n \u2022 Mortality Assumptions: We have reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the Society of Actuaries in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and determined our current assumptions are appropriate to measure our December 31, 2015 U.S. pension plans' benefit obligations. \nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d) and associated expense. The changes in these assumptions have no effect on our funding requirements.\n\nThe assumed health care trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for non-pension plans. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the assumed health care trend rate:\n\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental remediation liabilities are recognized when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental remediation is estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based on current law and considers the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that, where applicable, other responsible parties will be able to fulfill their legal obligations and commitments. The process of estimating environmental remediation liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty as to what remediation and technology will be required, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and, if applicable, other responsible parties. In future periods, new laws or regulations, advances in remediation technologies and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimates. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nIn determining whether the fair value of asset retirement obligations (\"ARO\") can reasonably be estimated, we must determine if the obligation can be assessed in relation to the acquisition price of the related asset or if an active market exists to transfer the obligation. If the obligation cannot be assessed in connection with an acquisition price and if no market exists for the transfer of the obligation, we must determine if it has sufficient information upon which to estimate the obligation using expected present value techniques. This determination requires us to estimate the range of settlement dates and the potential methods of settlement, and then to assign the probabilities to the various potential settlement dates and methods. The majority of the identified ARO liabilities involve Asbestos related cleanup. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details. We cannot ensure that ARO requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Investments in Affiliates and Expected Useful Lives\nWe monitor our long-lived and definite lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows, including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Even if an impairment charge is not required, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets. We estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments, and review of appraisals. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) future production estimates; (2) customer preferences and decisions; (3) product pricing; (4) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (5) product life / business retention. Any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values, which could materially effect our future results of operations and financial condition. We believe the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We perform impairment assessments at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount (step 1), goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step is to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess. Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis that have the most significant effect on the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units are the weighted average cost of capital and revenue growth-rates.\nWe perform an annual impairment analysis of our trademarks and brand names annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. We perform quantitative assessment estimating fair values based upon the prospective stream of hypothetical after-tax royalty cost savings discounted at rates that reflect the rates of return appropriate for these intangible assets. Our trademarks and brand names further broken down by product line. The primary, and most sensitive, input utilized in determining the fair values of trademarks and brand names is sales by product line. We Company performed a sensitivity analysis on its trademarks and brand names and determined that a one percentage point decrease in its projected future sales growth rates within each aftermarket product line would result in a $1 million impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods.\nWhen establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future sources of taxable income such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards\u201d and tax planning strategies.\u201d A tax planning strategy is defined as an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets.\u201d In the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability. Changes in our estimates, due to unforeseen events or otherwise, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We use a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax\npositions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nNon-GAAP Measures:\nManagement utilizes Operational EBITDA as the key performance measure of segment profitability and uses the measure in its financial and operational decision making processes; for internal reporting; and for planning and forecasting purposes to effectively allocate resources. Operational EBIDTA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), as adjusted for additional amounts. Examples of these adjustments include impairment charges related to goodwill, other long-lived assets and investments; restructuring charges; certain gains or losses on the settlement/extinguishment of obligations; and receivable financing charges. During 2015, we modified our definition of Operational EBITDA to adjust for financing charges related to certain receivable financing programs. Comparable periods have been adjusted to conform to this definition.\nOperational EBITDA presents a performance measure exclusive of capital structure and the method by which net assets were acquired, disposed of, or financed. Management believes this measure provides additional transparency into its core operations and is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments and reporting units. The measure also allows management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among operating segments.\nOperational EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure to Operational EBITDA that is in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Operational EBITDA, as determined and measured by Federal Mogul, should not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read in connection with Items 1, 3 and 7A of this Form 10-K, as well as Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1.A. Risk Factors.\u201d These items provide additional relevant information regarding the business, our strategy, and the various industry dynamics in the OE market and the aftermarket which have a direct and significant effect on our results of operations, as well as the risks associated with our business.\nConsolidated Results:\n\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nSales: Consolidated net sales increased by $102 million, or 1.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase over 2014 sales was primarily driven by a 10% increase in sales volumes of $743 million (which included a $657 million benefit from acquisitions) and was substantially offset by a $642 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of Sales: Cost of products sold increased by $85 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by a $645 million in incremental costs related to higher sales volumes attributable to acquisitions, and partly to volumes related to organic growth. This was substantially offset by the $529 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange and $31 million of savings from net performance. Net performance gains were burdened by incremental costs associated with the realignment of our North American distribution centers within our Motorparts division and strategic initiatives within both divisions.\nGross Profit: Gross profit as a percentage of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 14.5% compared to 14.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit increased by $17 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable effects of higher sales volumes (net of changes in mix) of $98 million, which included the effect from acquisitions, $32 million favorable effects of net performance. These favorable effects were substantially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as a percentage of sales, was 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 10.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase of $18 million is primarily attributable to the addition of SG&A expenses associated with acquisitions, partially offset by foreign exchange. Included in SG&A was a $7 million charge related to the bankruptcy of one of our aftermarket customers.\nResearch and development ( R&D\u201d) costs, including product and validation costs, of $189 million and $192 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nGoodwill and intangible impairment expense, net: Goodwill and intangible asset impairments decreased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we impaired $50 million and $44 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts and Powertrain segments. During 2014, we impaired $120 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts segment.\nRestructuring charges and asset impairments: Restructuring charges and asset impairments increased by $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was driven by overall higher severance and other charges of $3 million, primarily related to our overall restructuring efforts in Europe, and an increase in asset impairments of $8 million, primarily related to an impairment of assets held for sale during 2015.\nAmortization expense: Amortization expense increased by $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we completed the acquisition of TRW's valvetrain business thereby adding $107 million of definite lived intangible assets which contributed to the increase in amortization expense.\nEquity earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates: Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased by $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by increased earnings at a number of our nonconsolidated affiliates, including an initial investment in two new affiliates,\nand the sale of a nonconsolidated affiliate that incurred a loss of $1 million in 2014.\nLoss on Debt extinguishment: Loss on Debt extinguishment was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we entered into a new tranche B term loan facility and a new tranche C term loan facility and repaid our existing outstanding indebtedness under previous facilities. In conjunction with the transaction, we recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $24 million, including the write-off of a portion of related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nInterest Expense, Net: Net interest expense was $138 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the realization of higher interest rates for the full year, and increased borrowings under the Replacement Revolving Facility, offset by lower amortization costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net: Other expense, net was $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the decrease is a $6 million reduction in the amount of segmentation costs recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax (expense) / benefit: For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax expense of $30 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $81 million, compared to income tax expense of $56 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax losses with no tax benefits, partially offset by pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be not more likely than not to be realized and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be not more likely than not to be realized, income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to offsetting valuation allowance release, partially offset by pre-tax losses with no tax benefits and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nGain (loss) from discontinued operation, net of tax: During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $7 million adjustment (no income tax effect) which is included in Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within the consolidated statement of operations related to a 2013 divestiture of our fuel pump business.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nSales: Consolidated net sales increased by $531 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase over 2013 sales was primarily driven by a 9% increase in sales volumes resulting from a $356 million benefit from acquisitions, higher demand, and organic growth, together totaling $612 million, which was partially offset by a $51 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nCost of Sales: Cost of products sold increased by $494 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $505 million increase in costs primarily related to higher sales volumes, which is partly attributable to acquisitions, and $32 million of unfavorable net performance. These costs were partially offset by the $43 million favorable effect of foreign currency exchange.\nGross Profit: Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 14.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 15.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013. While gross profit increased by $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased sales volumes, the gross profit margin decreased primarily due to: changes in mix and pricing, and increases to strategic initiatives and unfavorable productivity.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as a percentage of sales, was 10.6% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase of $57 million is primarily attributable to the addition of SG&A expenses associated with acquisitions. Included in SG&A were research and development ( R&D\u201d) costs, including product and validation costs, of $192 million and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.\nGoodwill and intangible impairment expense, net: Goodwill and intangible asset impairments increased by $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. During 2014, we impaired $120 million of goodwill related to our Motorparts segment.\nInterest Expense, Net: Net interest expense was $120 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to the increased interest rates after the refinancing of our term loans in April 2014.\nRestructuring charges and asset impairments: Restructuring charges and asset impairments increased by $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to higher severance and other charges of $46 million, primarily related to our overall restructuring efforts in Europe, an increase in asset impairments of $16 million, which included a $5 million impairment of a nonconsolidated affiliate, partially offset by an OPEB curtailment gain recorded in 2013 that was related to a restructuring action.\nAmortization expense: Amortization expense increased by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. During 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain Affinia assets and DZV bearings operations thereby adding $52 million of definite lived intangible assets which contributed to the increase in amortization expense.\nEquity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates: Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased by $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by increased earnings at nonconsolidated affiliates located in the Asia and EMEA regions.\nLoss on Debt extinguishment: Loss on Debt extinguishment was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, we entered into a new tranche B term loan facility and a new tranche C term loan facility and repaid our existing outstanding indebtedness under previous facilities. In conjunction with the transaction, we recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $24 million, including the write-off of a portion of related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nOther Expense, Net: Other expense, net was $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The primary reason for the increase is the recognition of $10 million in segmentation costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nForeign currency exchange: We recognized $7 million in foreign currency exchange losses during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $10 million in foreign currency exchange losses during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIncome tax (expense) / benefit: For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $56 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $105 million, compared to income tax expense of $56 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment, pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are believed to be not more likely than not to be realized, income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to\noffsetting valuation allowance release, partially offset by pre-tax losses with no tax benefits and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to goodwill impairment with no tax benefit and pre-tax losses with no tax benefit, partially offset by pre-tax income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Statutory rate, income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to offsetting valuation allowance release, release of uncertain tax positions due to audit settlements, valuation allowance release, and a tax benefit recorded related to special economic zone tax incentive.\nGain (loss) from discontinued operation net of tax: During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a $52 million loss which is included in Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d within the consolidated statement of operations related to the divestiture of three separate businesses.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n2015 Sales Analysis:\n\n\n\nOther: Primarily represents commercial actions and pricing.\n2015 Cost of Products Sold Analysis:\n\nSales Volumes: The increase is primarily due to the increase in sales attributable to acquisitions.\nPerformance: Represents cost savings from various initiatives in excess of the costs to implement initiatives which are primarily focused on obtaining cost efficiencies, and/or are considered to be strategic in nature. Performance also includes the benefit of favorable material and service sourcing. The Motorparts segment includes costs related to the realignment of our North American distribution network.\n2015 Gross Profit Analysis:\n\n2015 Operational EBITDA Analysis:\n\nSales volume / mix: Sales volume and mix included in Operational EBITDA includes the effects of increased selling, general, and administrative expenses attributable to acquisitions, net of adjustments to earnings that are included in Operational EBITDA.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 to Year Ended December 31, 2013\n2014 Sales Analysis:\n\n\n\nOther: Primarily represents product pricing adjustments.\n2014 Cost of Products Sold Analysis:\n\nSales Volumes: The increase is primarily due to the increase in sales attributable to higher demand and organic growth in all regions within our Powertrain division and an increase in sales attributable to acquisitions within our Motorparts division.\nPerformance: Represents costs to implement various initiatives which are primarily focused on obtaining cost efficiencies, and/or are considered to be strategic in nature. This also includes increases in depreciation offset by favorable materials and service sourcing. Motorparts also incurred costs related to integrating recent acquisitions.\n2014 Gross Profit Analysis:\n\n2014 Operational EBITDA Analysis:\n\nSales volume / mix: Sales volume and mix included in Operational EBITDA includes the effects of increased selling, general, and administrative expenses attributable to acquisitions, net of adjustments to earnings that are included in Operational EBITDA.\nReconciliation of Operational EBITDA to Net Income (loss):\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOperating Activities\nAs summarized in the table below, net cash provided from (used by) operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\nThe decrease in cash provided by operations for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of: a $164 million increase in working capital requirements during 2015 as compared to a $59 million increase in the prior year (the increase was primarily driven by higher inventory levels required to support the realignment of the aftermarket distribution footprint); higher cash interest payments of $22 million; lower cash dividends from non-consolidated affiliates of $14 million; and a net increase in payments related to other operating expenses offset by the slight benefit of higher margins and performance improvements.\nThe decrease in cash provided by operations for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of: a $59 million increase in working capital requirements during 2014 as compared to a $59 million decrease in the prior year (the increase was required to support higher sales volumes); higher cash interest payments of $34 million; lower cash dividends from non-consolidated affiliates of $8 million; a the slight benefit of higher margins; and a net decrease in payments related to other operating expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nAs summarized in the table below, net cash provided from (used by) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\nCapital expenditures were $440 million, $418 million and $380 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These capital expenditures were primarily related to investing in new facilities, upgrading existing products, continuing new product launches, and infrastructure and equipment at our facilities to support our manufacturing, distribution and cost reduction efforts. We expect to spend between $390 million and $440 million on capital expenditures during 2016, depending on timing of expenditures, as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities and growth.\nDuring 2015, we acquired TRW's valvetrain business for $374 million. During 2014, we also made total payments of $321 million to acquire businesses, which included: $15 million to acquire the DZV bearings business, including assumed debt of $10 million; $140 million to acquire the Affinia chassis business, exclusive of $9 million of contingent consideration classified within financing activities; $156 million to acquire the Honeywell brake component business; and $10 million related to other acquisitions.\nDuring 2013, we received net proceeds of $26 million from divesting our sintered components operations located in France, our connecting rod manufacturing facility located in Canada, our camshaft foundry located in the United Kingdom, and our fuel pump business, which included an aftermarket business component and a manufacturing and research and development facility located in the United States.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flow provided from (used by) financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\n\nDuring 2015, net borrowings under the revolving line of credit increased by $357 million. The revolver was used to fund the acquisition of TRW's valvetrain business. We also issued 19 million shares of common stock for $250 million during 2015.\nOn April 15, 2014, we entered into a new tranche B term loan facility (the New Tranche B Facility\u201d) and a new tranche C term loan facility (the New Tranche C Facility,\u201d and together with the New Tranche B Facility, the New Term Facilities\u201d). Immediately following the closing of the New Term Facilities, we contributed all of the net proceeds from the New Facilities and repaid our existing outstanding indebtedness as a borrower under the tranche B and tranche C term loan facilities.\nDuring 2013, we completed a $500 million common stock rights offering and made a $250 million prepayment on our tranche B term loan.\nLiquidity\nThe following table summarizes our available liquidity:\n\nOur ability to maintain liquidity adequate to fund our needs depends generally on the results of our operations, spending on capital and restructuring initiatives, and the availability of financing. We believe that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and ability to secure additional borrowings will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and meet our operating obligations through the end of 2016. In the longer term, we believe that our base operating potential, supplemented by the benefits from our announced restructuring programs, will provide adequate long-term\ncash flows. However, there can be no assurance that such initiatives are achievable in this regard.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe have the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding at December 31, 2015:\n\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nWe have subsidiaries in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy and the United States which are party to accounts receivable factoring and securitization facilities. Amounts factored under these facilities consist of the following:\n\nProceeds from the factoring of accounts receivable qualifying as sales and expenses associated with the factoring of accounts receivable are as follows:\n\nAccounts receivables factored but not qualifying as a sale were pledged as collateral and accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within Accounts receivable, net\u201d and Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt.\u201d\nThe financing charges on sales of accounts receivable are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within other income/(expense), net. Where we receive a fee to service and monitor these transferred receivables, such fees are sufficient to offset the costs and as such, a servicing asset or liability is not recorded as a result of such activities.\nCertain of the facilities contain terms that require us to share in the credit risk of the sold receivables. The maximum exposures to us associated with these certain facilities' terms were $11 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 1, 2016, we completed the sale of one of our subsidiaries in France.\nIn February 2016, we increased our borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit by $50 million up to $600 million.\nOn February 3, 2016, IEP acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack (\"Pep Boys\"), a leading aftermarket provider of automotive service, tires, parts and accessories across the United States and Puerto Rico. On February 4, 2016, IEP completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Pep Boys. Motorparts sales to Pep Boys in 2015 were approximately $5 million.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Company announced its receipt of a proposal from its majority shareholder, IEP to purchase the shares of Federal-Mogul common stock not owned by IEP in a merger transaction.", "item_7_tables": "Table 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

global supplier of components and accessories to the automotive, small engine, and other industries. It operates two business segments: Powertrain and Motorparts.\n\n2015 Financial Results\n- Consolidated net sales were $7.4 billion, up 1.4% from 2014. The increase was driven by a 10% rise in sales volumes, largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.\n- Net loss attributable to Federal-Mogul was $110 million, including $94 million in goodwill/intangible impairment charges and $121 million in restructuring charges. This compares to a $168 million net loss in 2014.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Operating cash flow was $38 million in 2015, down from $278 million in 2014, largely due to higher working capital requirements and inventory build.\n- Capital expenditures were $440 million related to new facilities, upgrading products, and infrastructure improvements. \n- Total debt increased by $372 million, used to fund acquisitions like the $374 million purchase of TRW's valvetrain business.\n\nOutlook\n- Expect to benefit from acquisitions, restructuring, and strategic initiatives in coming years.\n- Base business should provide adequate cash flow, but cost reduction initiatives needed for profitability.\n- IEP has proposed to acquire the remaining Federal-Mogul shares it does not already own.\n\nSummary\nFederal-Mogul struggled with impairment charges and restructuring costs but saw improved sales. It maintains adequate liquidity but needs strategic initiatives and restructuring to improve profitability long-term."}
