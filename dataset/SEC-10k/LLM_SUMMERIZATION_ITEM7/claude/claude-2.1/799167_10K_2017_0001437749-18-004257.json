    "item_7": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading Risk Factors\u201d beginning on page 6. We do not assume, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this report.\nOverview\nThe primary source of our operating revenue is provided by our Truckload segment through a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada.\nOur Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers' requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews.\nGenerally, we are paid by the mile for our Truckload and Dedicated services. We also derive Truckload and Dedicated revenue from fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention and other ancillary services. The main factors that affect our Truckload and Dedicated revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, the number of miles we generate with our equipment and changes in fuel prices. We monitor our revenue production primarily through average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week. We also analyze our average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per total mile, non-revenue miles percentage, the miles per tractor we generate, our fuel surcharge revenue, our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue.\nOur Intermodal segment transports our customers' freight within the United States utilizing our temperature-controlled trailers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. The main factors that affect our Intermodal revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers.\nOur Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. The main factors that affect our Brokerage revenue are the rate per mile and other charges that we receive from our customers.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, our operating revenue is also affected by, among other things, the United States economy, inventory levels, the level of truck and rail capacity in the transportation market, a contracting driver market, severe weather conditions and specific customer demand.\nOur operating revenue increased $27.0 million, or 4.0%, in 2017. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased $13.1 million, or 2.1%, compared with 2016. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 1.0% from 2016, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 4.5% from 2016, primarily due to fleet growth and an increase in our average revenue per tractor. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 9.0% due to increased volume and Brokerage segment revenue increased 6.0% due to increased revenue per load in 2017. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to $67.1 million in 2017 from $53.2 million in 2016 due to higher fuel prices.\nOur profitability is impacted by the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers, fixed costs, and expenses containing both fixed and variable components. The variable costs include fuel expense, driver-related expenses, such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment, and independent contractor costs, which are recorded under purchased transportation. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency and other factors. Our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and subsequent depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and operating terminals. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, along with any increases in fleet size. Although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control, we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business. For example, fuel prices have significantly fluctuated over the past several years. We manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers, as well as through volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals. To help further reduce fuel expense, we have installed and tightly manage the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine, and also have improved the fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. For our Intermodal and Brokerage segments, our profitability is impacted by the percentage of revenue which is payable to the providers of the transportation services we arrange. This expense is included within purchased transportation in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d increased to 91.9% in 2017 from 91.3% in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 91.0% in 2017 and 90.6% in 2016. Our net income increased to $90.3 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, in 2017 from $33.5 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding a deferred income taxes benefit of $56.5 million recorded in 2017 to recognize the impact of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21% related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, net income improved 1.1% to $33.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, from 2016.\nOur business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. At December 31, 2017, we had $15.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $525.5 million in stockholders' equity and no long-term debt outstanding. In 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $121.9 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $87.6 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $7.9 million of long-term debt, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.8 million, and to pay cash dividends of $4.4 million, resulting in a $15.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. We estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately $115 million in 2018. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nOur business strategy encompasses a multifaceted set of transportation service solutions, primarily regional Truckload temperature-controlled operations along with Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage services, with a diverse customer base that gains value from and expands each of these operating segments. We believe that we are well-positioned regardless of the economic environment with the services we provide combined with our competitive position, cost control emphasis, modern fleet and strong balance sheet.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of net income and diluted earnings per share, net of a deferred income taxes benefit, operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of net income, diluted earnings per share, operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes.\nStock Split\nOn July 7, 2017, we effected a five-for-three stock split of our common stock, $.01 par value, in the form of a 66 \u2154% stock dividend. Our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other financial data contained in this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated certain operating statistics regarding our revenue and operations:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Truckload Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>380,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>375,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>398,361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,529 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average tractors(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average miles per trip\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>666 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total miles (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186,268 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dedicated Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,272 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average tractors(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average miles per trip\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total miles (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intermodal Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,958 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loads\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average tractors\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,403 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loads\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,060 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes tractors driven by both company-employed drivers and independent contractors.

Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased $13.1 million, or 2.1%, to $631.0 million in 2017 from $617.9 million in 2016. This increase was due to a $6.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $5.8 million increase in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $4.0 million increase in Brokerage revenue, partially offset by a $3.4 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to $67.1 million in 2017 from $53.2 million in 2016 due to higher fuel prices.\nTruckload segment revenue increased $4.4 million, or 1.2%, to $380.2 million in 2017 from $375.9 million in 2016. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $3.4 million, or 1.0%, to $336.6 million in 2017 from $340.0 million in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in insurance and claims expense, partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per tractor.\nDedicated segment revenue increased $9.5 million, or 6.0%, to $166.9 million in 2017 from $157.4 million in 2016. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 4.5% primarily due to fleet growth and an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio for our Dedicated segment was primarily due to an increase in insurance and claims expense, partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per tractor.\nIntermodal segment revenue increased $9.1 million, or 12.8%, to $80.6 million in 2017 from $71.5 million in 2016. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 9.0% from 2016 due to an increase in volume. The operating ratio in 2017 improved slightly from 2016.\nBrokerage segment revenue increased $4.0 million, or 6.0%, to $70.4 million in 2017 from $66.4 million in 2016 due to an increase in revenue per load. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2017 was achieved primarily through multiple cost control measures.\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the dollar and percentage increase

employees, including both driver and non-driver employees, employees' health insurance, 401(k) plan contributions and other fringe benefits. These expenses vary depending upon the size of our Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal tractor fleets, the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors, our efficiency, our experience with employees' health insurance claims, changes in health care premiums and other factors. Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased $1.3 million, or 0.6%, in 2017 from 2016. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2016 resulted primarily from an increase in non-driver bonus compensation expense of $2.3 million, partially offset by multiple other items.\nPurchased transportation consists of amounts payable to railroads and carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with Brokerage and Intermodal operations and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment. This category will vary depending upon the amount and rates, including fuel surcharges, we pay to third-party railroad and motor carriers, the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors and the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors. Purchased transportation expense increased $7.6 million in total, or 6.9%, in 2017 from 2016. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment increased $3.2 million to $58.6 million in 2017 from $55.4 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment increased $5.6 million to $51.5 million in 2017 from $45.9 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased intermodal revenue. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, decreased $1.2 million in 2017. We expect that purchased transportation expense will increase as we grow our Intermodal and Brokerage segments.\nFuel and fuel taxes increased by $11.3 million, or 12.0%, in 2017 from 2016. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) decreased $213,000, or 0.5%, to $46.8 million in 2017 from $47.0 million in 2016. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads increased to $8.6 million from $6.2 million in 2016. Despite an increase in the DOE national average cost of fuel to $2.65 per gallon from $2.30 per gallon in 2016, net fuel expense decreased to 8.4% of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 8.5% in 2016. The net fuel expense to revenue improved in 2017 primarily due to increases in our miles per gallon and in our revenue rate per mile. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers' fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. Auxiliary power units, which we have installed in our company-owned tractors, provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine.\nSupplies and maintenance consist of repairs, maintenance, tires, parts, oil and engine fluids, along with load-specific expenses including loading/unloading, tolls, pallets and trailer hostling. Our supplies and maintenance expense decreased $2.3 million, or 5.2%, from 2016 primarily due to decreased repair costs at external facilities and a reduction in parts costs.\nDepreciation relates to owned tractors, trailers, auxiliary power units, communication units, terminal facilities and other assets. The increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, which will result in greater depreciation over the useful life.\nInsurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and accruals we make for claims within our self-insured retention amounts, primarily for personal injury, property damage, physical damage to our equipment, cargo claims and workers' compensation claims. These expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience, our self-insured retention levels and the market for insurance. The $6.4 million increase in insurance and claims in 2017 was primarily due to increases in the cost of physical damage claims related to our tractors and trailers, in self-insured workers' compensation claims, and in auto liability insurance premiums. Our significant self-insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods which could materially impact our financial results depending on the frequency, severity and timing of claims.\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment decreased to $5.5 million in 2017 from $10.5 million in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the average gain for tractors and trailers within a soft equipment market. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control.\nThe $3.2 million decrease in other operating expenses in 2017 was primarily due to proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit, net of current period legal expenses, of $1.0 million, along with multiple cost control measures.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d was 91.9% in 2017 and 91.3% in 2016. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 93.1% in 2017 and 92.7% in 2016, for our Dedicated segment was 89.8% in 2017 and 87.6% in 2016, for our Intermodal segment was 89.7% in 2017 and 90.0% in 2016, and for our Brokerage segment was 92.7% in 2017 and 93.7% in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 91.0% in 2017 and 90.6% in 2016.\nThe decrease in our non-operating expense was primarily due to improved operating results in 2017 by MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a 45% owned affiliate.\nOur effective income tax rate decreased to (59.9%) in 2017 from 41.4% in 2016. We recorded a $56.5 million deferred income taxes benefit in 2017 to recognize the impact of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21% related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding that benefit, the effective tax rate was 40.1% in 2017. The decrease to 40.1% was due in part to certain federal employment tax credits realized as a discrete item and an excess tax benefit of $176,000 which was recorded as a decrease to the provision for income taxes in 2017 with the adoption of the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d in 2017. In addition to the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, which will lower our effective tax rate by 14 points beginning in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 establishes new tax laws that will affect us beginning in 2018 including, but not limited to, bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property and the repeal of like-kind exchanges.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income increased to $90.3 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, in 2017 from $33.5 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding the deferred income taxes benefit, 2017 net income improved 1.1% to $33.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, from 2016.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December

$665.0 million in 2015, despite a 26.4% decrease in fuel surcharge revenue to $53.2 million from $72.3 million in 2015 due to lower fuel prices. Our operating revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and revenue from our dry container service discontinued in March 2015, increased $26.6 million, or 4.5%, to $617.9 million in 2016 from $591.3 million in 2015. This increase was due to a $39.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, partially offset by an $8.1 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $5.0 million decrease in Brokerage revenue, and a $49,000 decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and the discontinued dry container service.\nTruckload segment revenue decreased $22.5 million, or 5.7%, to $375.9 million in 2016 from $398.4 million in 2015. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $8.1 million, or 2.3%, to $340.0 million in 2016 from $348.1 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio in 2016 was also primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor within a continued soft freight market.\nDedicated segment revenue increased $39.1 million, or 33.1%, to $157.4 million in 2016 from $118.3 million in 2015. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 37.1% primarily due to an increase in our average fleet size of 36.7% driven by a significant increase in the number of Dedicated contracts we have with customers. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was achieved primarily through multiple cost control measures.\nIntermodal segment revenue decreased $5.5 million, or 7.1%, to $71.5 million in 2016 from $77.0 million in 2015. Intermodal segment revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and $1.3 million of revenue from our discontinued dry container service, decreased $49,000 from 2015 due to a decrease in volume. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was primarily due to the disposal of our dry container service, which produced a higher operating ratio than our temperature-controlled trailer service, and decreases in salaries, wages and benefits and depreciation expense, as the fleet size was reduced to optimize productivity.\nBrokerage segment revenue decreased $5.0 million, or 7.0%, to $66.4 million in 2016 from $71.4 million in 2015, due to a decrease in revenue per load, primarily caused by lower fuel surcharges. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was primarily driven by a decrease in the percentage of the amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged to our Brokerage revenue.\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the dollar and percentage increase or decrease of the items in our consolidated statements of operations, and those items as a percentage of operating revenue:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage

The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2015 resulted primarily from a 6.3% increase in the total miles driven by company drivers and increases to several components of the amount paid to company drivers, along with an increase in employees' health insurance expense of $1.8 million due to an increase in our self-insured medical claims, partially offset by a decrease of $960,000 in bonus compensation expense for our non-driver employees.\nPurchased transportation expense decreased $7.3 million in total, or 6.2%, in 2016 from 2015. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment decreased $5.1 million to $55.4 million in 2016 from $60.5 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment decreased $3.4 million to $45.9 million in 2016 from $49.3 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreased revenue within our temperature-controlled intermodal trailer service, along with the disposal in March 2015 of the dry containers that were used in a portion of our intermodal operations. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, increased $1.2 million in 2016.\nFuel and fuel taxes decreased by $10.5 million, or 10.0%, in 2016 from 2015. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) increased $5.9 million, or 14.4%, to $47.0 million in 2016 from $41.1 million in 2015. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads decreased to $6.2 million from $8.9 million in 2015. Despite a decrease in the DOE national average cost of fuel to $2.30 per gallon from $2.71 per gallon in 2015, net fuel expense increased to 8.5% of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 7.9% in 2015. The net fuel expense to revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to our discount from retail being larger in 2015 as the result of a significant decrease in fuel prices during the first quarter, compared with level fuel prices in the first quarter of 2016. The discount from retail typically increases when prices decrease. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers' fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers.\nThe increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment and growth of our fleet.\nThe $3.0 million increase in insurance and claims in 2016 was primarily due to increases in self-insured auto liability claims and auto liability insurance premiums.\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment increased to $10.5 million in 2016 from $5.6 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in both the average gain per tractor and in the number of tractors sold.\nGain on disposition of facilities was $4.1 million in 2015. The disposition of the facilities, located in Ontario, CA and Indianapolis, IN, was part of our ongoing program to expand and update the footprint of our facilities throughout the United States, in which we have spent over $94 million since 2009. Any future gains or losses on disposition of facilities will be impacted by the market for real estate, which is beyond our control.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d was 91.3% in 2016 and 90.8% in 2015. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 92.7% in 2016 and 91.1% in 2015, for our Dedicated segment was 87.6% in 2016 and 89.2% in 2015, for our Intermodal segment was 90.0% in 2016 and 93.7% in 2015, and for our Brokerage segment was 93.7% in 2016 and 94.7% in 2015. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 90.6% in 2016. Our operating ratio for 2015, net of both the gain on disposition of facilities and fuel surcharges, was 90.4%.\nThe increase in our non-operating expense was primarily due to increased losses in 2016 by MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a 45% owned affiliate.\nOur effective income tax rate increased slightly to 41.4% in 2016 from 41.1% in 2015.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income was $33.5 million in 2016 and $35.7 million in 2015. Net earnings per diluted share was $0.61 in 2016 and $0.64 in 2015. Net income in 2016 improved 0.4% over earnings of $33.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in 2015 excluding the gain on disposition of facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. Our primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations and our revolving credit facility. A portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. We have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractors or obtain financing through third parties.\nThe table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used for investing activities and net cash flows used for financing activities for the years indicated.\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows used for investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95,318 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97,290 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125,081 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows used for financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,258 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,457 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,278 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2007, our Board of Directors approved and we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock either through purchases on the open market or through private transactions and in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an increase in the share repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to $40 million, or approximately 2 million shares, of our common stock, which was increased by our Board of Directors to 3.3 million shares on August 15, 2017 to reflect the five-for-three stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on July 7, 2017. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nWe repurchased and retired 759,302 shares of our common stock for $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 and did not repurchase any shares in the last three quarters of 2016 or in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2015 we repurchased and retired 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $16.2 million.\nIn 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $121.9 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $87.6 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $7.9 million of long-term debt, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.8 million, and to pay cash dividends of $4.4 million, resulting in a $15.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. In 2016, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $133.8 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $89.9 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.1 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $30.0 million of long-term debt, to repurchase and retire 759,302 shares of our common stock for $7.5 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. In 2015, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $128.7 million and net borrowings under our credit facility of $13.5 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $118.2 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $8.6 million, to repurchase and retire 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $16.2 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. Our net cash flows beginning in 2018 will be increased by the new tax laws established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which reduce the federal corporate statutory income tax rate and establish bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified assets, partially offset by the repeal of like-kind exchanges.\nWe estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately $115 million in 2018. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each of the first two quarters of 2017 along with dividends of $0.025 per share in each of 2017's last two quarters, which totaled $4.4 million. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2016 and 2015 and totaled $3.3 million in each of the two years. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. The payment of cash dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, and certain corporate law requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nWe maintain a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured committed credit facility which matures in December 2019. In April 2016, we elected to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the facility from $75.0 million to $30.0 million. In December 2016, we entered into an amendment to the facility which increased the aggregate principal amount to $40.0 million. At December 31, 2017, there was no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims of $12.9 million and remaining borrowing availability of $27.1 million. This facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or the lender's Prime Rate, in each case plus/minus applicable margins.\nOur credit facility prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of 25% of our net income from the prior fiscal year. A waiver of the 25% limitation for 2016 was obtained from the lender. This facility also contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, require us to maintain compliance with cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAnd\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAnd\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations for revenue equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,866 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,604 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows, the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2017 of 175,449 shares of Company common stock with a value of $3.6 million has been excluded from the above table.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than standby letters of credit maintained in connection with our self-insurance programs in the amount of $12.9 million along with purchase obligations and operating leases summarized above in our summary of contractual obligations, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017.\nInflation and Fuel Costs\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. During the past three years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices, accident claims, health insurance and employee compensation. We attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts.\nIn addition to inflation, fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability. We require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature-control units on our trailers. Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions. Although we historically have been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges and higher rates, such increases usually are not fully recovered. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling.\nSeasonality\nOur tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, lower fuel efficiency and more equipment repairs.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue, including fuel surcharges, at the time shipment of freight is completed. We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor in the arrangements, we have the ability to establish prices, we have the risk of loss in the event of cargo claims and we bear credit risk with customer payments. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The FASB has also issued, along with other additional guidance related to revenue recognition matters, ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).\u201d The standards, which are effective for the first quarter of 2018, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and will require additional disclosures. The new standards will require us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four segments over time, compared with our current policy in which we record revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight is completed. Our current policy in which we account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis is appropriate under the new standards.\nAccounts Receivable. We are dependent upon a limited number of customers, and, as a result, our trade accounts receivable are highly concentrated. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $300,000 as of December 31, 2017 and $275,000 as of December 31, 2016. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances, including any billing disputes. In order to assess the collectibility of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best information available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. We evaluate the allowance based on historical write-off experience, the size of the individual customer balances, past-due amounts and the overall national economy. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly.\nProperty and Equipment. The transportation industry requires significant capital investments. Our net property and equipment was $571.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and $557.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Our depreciation expense was $85.1 million in 2017, $82.4 million in 2016 and $75.3 million in 2015. We compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset, reduced by its estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. We determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment, prior useful lives and changes in technology. We have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers within the last ten years. We believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A 5% decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of December 31, 2017 by approximately $11.1 million, or 1.9%.\nImpairment of Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.\nInsurance and Claims. We self-insure, in part, for losses relating to workers' compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, along with employees' health insurance with varying risk retention levels. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review. However, we could suffer a series of losses within our self-insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. We are responsible for the first $1.0 million on each auto liability claim and for the first $750,000 on each workers' compensation claim. We have $12.9 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. The insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated balance sheets were $26.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and $19.4 million as of December 31, 2016. We reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims. We periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical development. Actual results could differ from these current estimates. In addition, to the extent that claims are litigated and not settled, jury awards are difficult to predict.\nShare-based Payment Arrangement Compensation. We have granted stock options to certain employees and non-employee directors. We recognize compensation expense for all stock options net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only record compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (normally the vesting period). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock options require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock options and stock price volatility. We use the Black-Scholes model to value our stock option awards. We believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility. Thus, we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, stock option compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nWe have also granted performance unit awards to certain employees which are subject to vesting requirements over a five-year period, primarily based on our earnings growth. The fair value of each performance unit is based on the closing market price on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for these awards based on the estimated number of units probable of achieving the performance and service vesting requirements of the awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the respective dates of adoption and effect on our results of operations and financial position.",
    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading Risk Factors\u201d beginning on page 6. We do not assume, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this report.\nOverview\nThe primary source of our operating revenue is provided by our Truckload segment through a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada.\nOur Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers' requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews.\nGenerally, we are paid by the mile for our Truckload and Dedicated services. We also derive Truckload and Dedicated revenue from fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention and other ancillary services. The main factors that affect our Truckload and Dedicated revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, the number of miles we generate with our equipment and changes in fuel prices. We monitor our revenue production primarily through average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week. We also analyze our average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per total mile, non-revenue miles percentage, the miles per tractor we generate, our fuel surcharge revenue, our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue.\nOur Intermodal segment transports our customers' freight within the United States utilizing our temperature-controlled trailers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. The main factors that affect our Intermodal revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers.\nOur Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. The main factors that affect our Brokerage revenue are the rate per mile and other charges that we receive from our customers.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, our operating revenue is also affected by, among other things, the United States economy, inventory levels, the level of truck and rail capacity in the transportation market, a contracting driver market, severe weather conditions and specific customer demand.\nOur operating revenue increased $27.0 million, or 4.0%, in 2017. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased $13.1 million, or 2.1%, compared with 2016. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 1.0% from 2016, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 4.5% from 2016, primarily due to fleet growth and an increase in our average revenue per tractor. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 9.0% due to increased volume and Brokerage segment revenue increased 6.0% due to increased revenue per load in 2017. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to $67.1 million in 2017 from $53.2 million in 2016 due to higher fuel prices.\nOur profitability is impacted by the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers, fixed costs, and expenses containing both fixed and variable components. The variable costs include fuel expense, driver-related expenses, such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment, and independent contractor costs, which are recorded under purchased transportation. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency and other factors. Our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and subsequent depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and operating terminals. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, along with any increases in fleet size. Although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control, we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business. For example, fuel prices have significantly fluctuated over the past several years. We manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers, as well as through volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals. To help further reduce fuel expense, we have installed and tightly manage the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine, and also have improved the fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. For our Intermodal and Brokerage segments, our profitability is impacted by the percentage of revenue which is payable to the providers of the transportation services we arrange. This expense is included within purchased transportation in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d increased to 91.9% in 2017 from 91.3% in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 91.0% in 2017 and 90.6% in 2016. Our net income increased to $90.3 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, in 2017 from $33.5 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding a deferred income taxes benefit of $56.5 million recorded in 2017 to recognize the impact of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21% related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, net income improved 1.1% to $33.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, from 2016.\nOur business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. At December 31, 2017, we had $15.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $525.5 million in stockholders' equity and no long-term debt outstanding. In 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $121.9 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $87.6 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $7.9 million of long-term debt, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.8 million, and to pay cash dividends of $4.4 million, resulting in a $15.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. We estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately $115 million in 2018. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nOur business strategy encompasses a multifaceted set of transportation service solutions, primarily regional Truckload temperature-controlled operations along with Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage services, with a diverse customer base that gains value from and expands each of these operating segments. We believe that we are well-positioned regardless of the economic environment with the services we provide combined with our competitive position, cost control emphasis, modern fleet and strong balance sheet.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of net income and diluted earnings per share, net of a deferred income taxes benefit, operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of net income, diluted earnings per share, operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes.\nStock Split\nOn July 7, 2017, we effected a five-for-three stock split of our common stock, $.01 par value, in the form of a 66 \u2154% stock dividend. Our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other financial data contained in this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated certain operating statistics regarding our revenue and operations:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Truckload Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>380,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>375,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>398,361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,529 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average tractors(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average miles per trip\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>666 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total miles (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186,268 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dedicated Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,272 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average tractors(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average miles per trip\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total miles (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intermodal Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,958 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loads\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average tractors\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,403 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loads\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,060 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes tractors driven by both company-employed drivers and independent contractors.

$27.0 million, or 4.0%, to $698.1 million in 2017 from $671.1 million in 2016. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased $13.1 million, or 2.1%, to $631.0 million in 2017 from $617.9 million in 2016. This increase was due to a $6.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $5.8 million increase in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $4.0 million increase in Brokerage revenue, partially offset by a $3.4 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to $67.1 million in 2017 from $53.2 million in 2016 due to higher fuel prices.\nTruckload segment revenue increased $4.4 million, or 1.2%, to $380.2 million in 2017 from $375.9 million in 2016. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $3.4 million, or 1.0%, to $336.6 million in 2017 from $340.0 million in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in insurance and claims expense, partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per tractor.\nDedicated segment revenue increased $9.5 million, or 6.0%, to $166.9 million in 2017 from $157.4 million in 2016. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 4.5% primarily due to fleet growth and an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio for our Dedicated segment was primarily due to an increase in insurance and claims expense, partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per tractor.\nIntermodal segment revenue increased $9.1 million, or 12.8%, to $80.6 million in 2017 from $71.5 million in 2016. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 9.0% from 2016 due to an increase in volume. The operating ratio in 2017 improved slightly from 2016.\nBrokerage segment revenue increased $4.0 million, or 6.0%, to $70.4 million in 2017 from $66.4 million in 2016 due to an increase in revenue per load. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2017 was achieved primarily through multiple cost control measures.\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the dollar and percentage increase

employees, including both driver and non-driver employees, employees' health insurance, 401(k) plan contributions and other fringe benefits. These expenses vary depending upon the size of our Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal tractor fleets, the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors, our efficiency, our experience with employees' health insurance claims, changes in health care premiums and other factors. Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased $1.3 million, or 0.6%, in 2017 from 2016. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2016 resulted primarily from an increase in non-driver bonus compensation expense of $2.3 million, partially offset by multiple other items.\nPurchased transportation consists of amounts payable to railroads and carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with Brokerage and Intermodal operations and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment. This category will vary depending upon the amount and rates, including fuel surcharges, we pay to third-party railroad and motor carriers, the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors and the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors. Purchased transportation expense increased $7.6 million in total, or 6.9%, in 2017 from 2016. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment increased $3.2 million to $58.6 million in 2017 from $55.4 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment increased $5.6 million to $51.5 million in 2017 from $45.9 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased intermodal revenue. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, decreased $1.2 million in 2017. We expect that purchased transportation expense will increase as we grow our Intermodal and Brokerage segments.\nFuel and fuel taxes increased by $11.3 million, or 12.0%, in 2017 from 2016. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) decreased $213,000, or 0.5%, to $46.8 million in 2017 from $47.0 million in 2016. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads increased to $8.6 million from $6.2 million in 2016. Despite an increase in the DOE national average cost of fuel to $2.65 per gallon from $2.30 per gallon in 2016, net fuel expense decreased to 8.4% of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 8.5% in 2016. The net fuel expense to revenue improved in 2017 primarily due to increases in our miles per gallon and in our revenue rate per mile. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers' fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. Auxiliary power units, which we have installed in our company-owned tractors, provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine.\nSupplies and maintenance consist of repairs, maintenance, tires, parts, oil and engine fluids, along with load-specific expenses including loading/unloading, tolls, pallets and trailer hostling. Our supplies and maintenance expense decreased $2.3 million, or 5.2%, from 2016 primarily due to decreased repair costs at external facilities and a reduction in parts costs.\nDepreciation relates to owned tractors, trailers, auxiliary power units, communication units, terminal facilities and other assets. The increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, which will result in greater depreciation over the useful life.\nInsurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and accruals we make for claims within our self-insured retention amounts, primarily for personal injury, property damage, physical damage to our equipment, cargo claims and workers' compensation claims. These expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience, our self-insured retention levels and the market for insurance. The $6.4 million increase in insurance and claims in 2017 was primarily due to increases in the cost of physical damage claims related to our tractors and trailers, in self-insured workers' compensation claims, and in auto liability insurance premiums. Our significant self-insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods which could materially impact our financial results depending on the frequency, severity and timing of claims.\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment decreased to $5.5 million in 2017 from $10.5 million in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the average gain for tractors and trailers within a soft equipment market. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control.\nThe $3.2 million decrease in other operating expenses in 2017 was primarily due to proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit, net of current period legal expenses, of $1.0 million, along with multiple cost control measures.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d was 91.9% in 2017 and 91.3% in 2016. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 93.1% in 2017 and 92.7% in 2016, for our Dedicated segment was 89.8% in 2017 and 87.6% in 2016, for our Intermodal segment was 89.7% in 2017 and 90.0% in 2016, and for our Brokerage segment was 92.7% in 2017 and 93.7% in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 91.0% in 2017 and 90.6% in 2016.\nThe decrease in our non-operating expense was primarily due to improved operating results in 2017 by MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a 45% owned affiliate.\nOur effective income tax rate decreased to (59.9%) in 2017 from 41.4% in 2016. We recorded a $56.5 million deferred income taxes benefit in 2017 to recognize the impact of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21% related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding that benefit, the effective tax rate was 40.1% in 2017. The decrease to 40.1% was due in part to certain federal employment tax credits realized as a discrete item and an excess tax benefit of $176,000 which was recorded as a decrease to the provision for income taxes in 2017 with the adoption of the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d in 2017. In addition to the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, which will lower our effective tax rate by 14 points beginning in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 establishes new tax laws that will affect us beginning in 2018 including, but not limited to, bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property and the repeal of like-kind exchanges.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income increased to $90.3 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, in 2017 from $33.5 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding the deferred income taxes benefit, 2017 net income improved 1.1% to $33.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, from 2016.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December

operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue. \nOur operating revenue increased $6.2 million, or 0.9%, to $671.1 million in 2016 from $665.0 million in 2015, despite a 26.4% decrease in fuel surcharge revenue to $53.2 million from $72.3 million in 2015 due to lower fuel prices. Our operating revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and revenue from our dry container service discontinued in March 2015, increased $26.6 million, or 4.5%, to $617.9 million in 2016 from $591.3 million in 2015. This increase was due to a $39.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, partially offset by an $8.1 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $5.0 million decrease in Brokerage revenue, and a $49,000 decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and the discontinued dry container service.\nTruckload segment revenue decreased $22.5 million, or 5.7%, to $375.9 million in 2016 from $398.4 million in 2015. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $8.1 million, or 2.3%, to $340.0 million in 2016 from $348.1 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio in 2016 was also primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor within a continued soft freight market.\nDedicated segment revenue increased $39.1 million, or 33.1%, to $157.4 million in 2016 from $118.3 million in 2015. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 37.1% primarily due to an increase in our average fleet size of 36.7% driven by a significant increase in the number of Dedicated contracts we have with customers. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was achieved primarily through multiple cost control measures.\nIntermodal segment revenue decreased $5.5 million, or 7.1%, to $71.5 million in 2016 from $77.0 million in 2015. Intermodal segment revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and $1.3 million of revenue from our discontinued dry container service, decreased $49,000 from 2015 due to a decrease in volume. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was primarily due to the disposal of our dry container service, which produced a higher operating ratio than our temperature-controlled trailer service, and decreases in salaries, wages and benefits and depreciation expense, as the fleet size was reduced to optimize productivity.\nBrokerage segment revenue decreased $5.0 million, or 7.0%, to $66.4 million in 2016 from $71.4 million in 2015, due to a decrease in revenue per load, primarily caused by lower fuel surcharges. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was primarily driven by a decrease in the percentage of the amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged to our Brokerage revenue.\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the dollar and percentage increase or decrease of the items in our consolidated statements of operations, and those items as a percentage of operating revenue:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dollar\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percentage

The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2015 resulted primarily from a 6.3% increase in the total miles driven by company drivers and increases to several components of the amount paid to company drivers, along with an increase in employees' health insurance expense of $1.8 million due to an increase in our self-insured medical claims, partially offset by a decrease of $960,000 in bonus compensation expense for our non-driver employees.\nPurchased transportation expense decreased $7.3 million in total, or 6.2%, in 2016 from 2015. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment decreased $5.1 million to $55.4 million in 2016 from $60.5 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment decreased $3.4 million to $45.9 million in 2016 from $49.3 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreased revenue within our temperature-controlled intermodal trailer service, along with the disposal in March 2015 of the dry containers that were used in a portion of our intermodal operations. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, increased $1.2 million in 2016.\nFuel and fuel taxes decreased by $10.5 million, or 10.0%, in 2016 from 2015. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) increased $5.9 million, or 14.4%, to $47.0 million in 2016 from $41.1 million in 2015. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads decreased to $6.2 million from $8.9 million in 2015. Despite a decrease in the DOE national average cost of fuel to $2.30 per gallon from $2.71 per gallon in 2015, net fuel expense increased to 8.5% of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 7.9% in 2015. The net fuel expense to revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to our discount from retail being larger in 2015 as the result of a significant decrease in fuel prices during the first quarter, compared with level fuel prices in the first quarter of 2016. The discount from retail typically increases when prices decrease. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers' fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers.\nThe increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment and growth of our fleet.\nThe $3.0 million increase in insurance and claims in 2016 was primarily due to increases in self-insured auto liability claims and auto liability insurance premiums.\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment increased to $10.5 million in 2016 from $5.6 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in both the average gain per tractor and in the number of tractors sold.\nGain on disposition of facilities was $4.1 million in 2015. The disposition of the facilities, located in Ontario, CA and Indianapolis, IN, was part of our ongoing program to expand and update the footprint of our facilities throughout the United States, in which we have spent over $94 million since 2009. Any future gains or losses on disposition of facilities will be impacted by the market for real estate, which is beyond our control.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d was 91.3% in 2016 and 90.8% in 2015. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 92.7% in 2016 and 91.1% in 2015, for our Dedicated segment was 87.6% in 2016 and 89.2% in 2015, for our Intermodal segment was 90.0% in 2016 and 93.7% in 2015, and for our Brokerage segment was 93.7% in 2016 and 94.7% in 2015. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 90.6% in 2016. Our operating ratio for 2015, net of both the gain on disposition of facilities and fuel surcharges, was 90.4%.\nThe increase in our non-operating expense was primarily due to increased losses in 2016 by MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a 45% owned affiliate.\nOur effective income tax rate increased slightly to 41.4% in 2016 from 41.1% in 2015.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income was $33.5 million in 2016 and $35.7 million in 2015. Net earnings per diluted share was $0.61 in 2016 and $0.64 in 2015. Net income in 2016 improved 0.4% over earnings of $33.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in 2015 excluding the gain on disposition of facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. Our primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations and our revolving credit facility. A portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. We have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractors or obtain financing through third parties.\nThe table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used for investing activities and net cash flows used for financing activities for the years indicated.\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows used for investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95,318 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97,290 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125,081 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows used for financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,258 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,457 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,278 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2007, our Board of Directors approved and we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock either through purchases on the open market or through private transactions and in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an increase in the share repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to $40 million, or approximately 2 million shares, of our common stock, which was increased by our Board of Directors to 3.3 million shares on August 15, 2017 to reflect the five-for-three stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on July 7, 2017. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nWe repurchased and retired 759,302 shares of our common stock for $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 and did not repurchase any shares in the last three quarters of 2016 or in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2015 we repurchased and retired 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $16.2 million.\nIn 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $121.9 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $87.6 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $7.9 million of long-term debt, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.8 million, and to pay cash dividends of $4.4 million, resulting in a $15.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. In 2016, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $133.8 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $89.9 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.1 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $30.0 million of long-term debt, to repurchase and retire 759,302 shares of our common stock for $7.5 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. In 2015, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $128.7 million and net borrowings under our credit facility of $13.5 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $118.2 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $8.6 million, to repurchase and retire 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $16.2 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. Our net cash flows beginning in 2018 will be increased by the new tax laws established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which reduce the federal corporate statutory income tax rate and establish bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified assets, partially offset by the repeal of like-kind exchanges.\nWe estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately $115 million in 2018. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each of the first two quarters of 2017 along with dividends of $0.025 per share in each of 2017's last two quarters, which totaled $4.4 million. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2016 and 2015 and totaled $3.3 million in each of the two years. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. The payment of cash dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, and certain corporate law requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nWe maintain a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured committed credit facility which matures in December 2019. In April 2016, we elected to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the facility from $75.0 million to $30.0 million. In December 2016, we entered into an amendment to the facility which increased the aggregate principal amount to $40.0 million. At December 31, 2017, there was no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims of $12.9 million and remaining borrowing availability of $27.1 million. This facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or the lender's Prime Rate, in each case plus/minus applicable margins.\nOur credit facility prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of 25% of our net income from the prior fiscal year. A waiver of the 25% limitation for 2016 was obtained from the lender. This facility also contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, require us to maintain compliance with cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAnd\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAnd\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations for revenue equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,866 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,604 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows, the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2017 of 175,449 shares of Company common stock with a value of $3.6 million has been excluded from the above table.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than standby letters of credit maintained in connection with our self-insurance programs in the amount of $12.9 million along with purchase obligations and operating leases summarized above in our summary of contractual obligations, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017.\nInflation and Fuel Costs\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. During the past three years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices, accident claims, health insurance and employee compensation. We attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts.\nIn addition to inflation, fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability. We require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature-control units on our trailers. Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions. Although we historically have been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges and higher rates, such increases usually are not fully recovered. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling.\nSeasonality\nOur tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, lower fuel efficiency and more equipment repairs.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue, including fuel surcharges, at the time shipment of freight is completed. We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor in the arrangements, we have the ability to establish prices, we have the risk of loss in the event of cargo claims and we bear credit risk with customer payments. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The FASB has also issued, along with other additional guidance related to revenue recognition matters, ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).\u201d The standards, which are effective for the first quarter of 2018, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and will require additional disclosures. The new standards will require us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four segments over time, compared with our current policy in which we record revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight is completed. Our current policy in which we account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis is appropriate under the new standards.\nAccounts Receivable. We are dependent upon a limited number of customers, and, as a result, our trade accounts receivable are highly concentrated. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $300,000 as of December 31, 2017 and $275,000 as of December 31, 2016. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances, including any billing disputes. In order to assess the collectibility of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best information available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. We evaluate the allowance based on historical write-off experience, the size of the individual customer balances, past-due amounts and the overall national economy. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly.\nProperty and Equipment. The transportation industry requires significant capital investments. Our net property and equipment was $571.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and $557.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Our depreciation expense was $85.1 million in 2017, $82.4 million in 2016 and $75.3 million in 2015. We compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset, reduced by its estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. We determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment, prior useful lives and changes in technology. We have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers within the last ten years. We believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A 5% decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of December 31, 2017 by approximately $11.1 million, or 1.9%.\nImpairment of Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.\nInsurance and Claims. We self-insure, in part, for losses relating to workers' compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, along with employees' health insurance with varying risk retention levels. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review. However, we could suffer a series of losses within our self-insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. We are responsible for the first $1.0 million on each auto liability claim and for the first $750,000 on each workers' compensation claim. We have $12.9 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. The insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated balance sheets were $26.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and $19.4 million as of December 31, 2016. We reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims. We periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical development. Actual results could differ from these current estimates. In addition, to the extent that claims are litigated and not settled, jury awards are difficult to predict.\nShare-based Payment Arrangement Compensation. We have granted stock options to certain employees and non-employee directors. We recognize compensation expense for all stock options net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only record compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (normally the vesting period). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock options require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock options and stock price volatility. We use the Black-Scholes model to value our stock option awards. We believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility. Thus, we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, stock option compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nWe have also granted performance unit awards to certain employees which are subject to vesting requirements over a five-year period, primarily based on our earnings growth. The fair value of each performance unit is based on the closing market price on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for these awards based on the estimated number of units probable of achieving the performance and service vesting requirements of the awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the respective dates of adoption and effect on our results of operations and financial position.",
    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading Risk Factors\u201d beginning on page 6. We do not assume, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this report.\nOverview\nThe primary source of our operating revenue is provided by our Truckload segment through a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada.\nOur Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers' requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews.\nGenerally, we are paid by the mile for our Truckload and Dedicated services. We also derive Truckload and Dedicated revenue from fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention and other ancillary services. The main factors that affect our Truckload and Dedicated revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, the number of miles we generate with our equipment and changes in fuel prices. We monitor our revenue production primarily through average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week. We also analyze our average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per total mile, non-revenue miles percentage, the miles per tractor we generate, our fuel surcharge revenue, our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue.\nOur Intermodal segment transports our customers' freight within the United States utilizing our temperature-controlled trailers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. The main factors that affect our Intermodal revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers.\nOur Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. The main factors that affect our Brokerage revenue are the rate per mile and other charges that we receive from our customers.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, our operating revenue is also affected by, among other things, the United States economy, inventory levels, the level of truck and rail capacity in the transportation market, a contracting driver market, severe weather conditions and specific customer demand.\nOur operating revenue increased $27.0 million, or 4.0%, in 2017. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased $13.1 million, or 2.1%, compared with 2016. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 1.0% from 2016, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 4.5% from 2016, primarily due to fleet growth and an increase in our average revenue per tractor. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 9.0% due to increased volume and Brokerage segment revenue increased 6.0% due to increased revenue per load in 2017. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to $67.1 million in 2017 from $53.2 million in 2016 due to higher fuel prices.\nOur profitability is impacted by the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers, fixed costs, and expenses containing both fixed and variable components. The variable costs include fuel expense, driver-related expenses, such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment, and independent contractor costs, which are recorded under purchased transportation. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency and other factors. Our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and subsequent depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and operating terminals. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, along with any increases in fleet size. Although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control, we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business. For example, fuel prices have significantly fluctuated over the past several years. We manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers, as well as through volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals. To help further reduce fuel expense, we have installed and tightly manage the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine, and also have improved the fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. For our Intermodal and Brokerage segments, our profitability is impacted by the percentage of revenue which is payable to the providers of the transportation services we arrange. This expense is included within purchased transportation in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d increased to 91.9% in 2017 from 91.3% in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 91.0% in 2017 and 90.6% in 2016. Our net income increased to $90.3 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, in 2017 from $33.5 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding a deferred income taxes benefit of $56.5 million recorded in 2017 to recognize the impact of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21% related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, net income improved 1.1% to $33.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, from 2016.\nOur business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. At December 31, 2017, we had $15.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $525.5 million in stockholders' equity and no long-term debt outstanding. In 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $121.9 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $87.6 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $7.9 million of long-term debt, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.8 million, and to pay cash dividends of $4.4 million, resulting in a $15.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. We estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately $115 million in 2018. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nOur business strategy encompasses a multifaceted set of transportation service solutions, primarily regional Truckload temperature-controlled operations along with Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage services, with a diverse customer base that gains value from and expands each of these operating segments. We believe that we are well-positioned regardless of the economic environment with the services we provide combined with our competitive position, cost control emphasis, modern fleet and strong balance sheet.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of net income and diluted earnings per share, net of a deferred income taxes benefit, operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of net income, diluted earnings per share, operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes.\nStock Split\nOn July 7, 2017, we effected a five-for-three stock split of our common stock, $.01 par value, in the form of a 66 \u2154% stock dividend. Our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other financial data contained in this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated certain operating statistics regarding our revenue and operations:\n\n (1) Includes tractors driven by both company-employed drivers and independent contractors. Independent contractors provided 60, 68 and 65 tractors as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2017 to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio by segment, along with the change for each component:\n\n (1) Represents operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue. \nOur operating revenue increased $27.0 million, or 4.0%, to $698.1 million in 2017 from $671.1 million in 2016. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased $13.1 million, or 2.1%, to $631.0 million in 2017 from $617.9 million in 2016. This increase was due to a $6.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $5.8 million increase in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $4.0 million increase in Brokerage revenue, partially offset by a $3.4 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to $67.1 million in 2017 from $53.2 million in 2016 due to higher fuel prices.\nTruckload segment revenue increased $4.4 million, or 1.2%, to $380.2 million in 2017 from $375.9 million in 2016. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $3.4 million, or 1.0%, to $336.6 million in 2017 from $340.0 million in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in insurance and claims expense, partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per tractor.\nDedicated segment revenue increased $9.5 million, or 6.0%, to $166.9 million in 2017 from $157.4 million in 2016. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 4.5% primarily due to fleet growth and an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio for our Dedicated segment was primarily due to an increase in insurance and claims expense, partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per tractor.\nIntermodal segment revenue increased $9.1 million, or 12.8%, to $80.6 million in 2017 from $71.5 million in 2016. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 9.0% from 2016 due to an increase in volume. The operating ratio in 2017 improved slightly from 2016.\nBrokerage segment revenue increased $4.0 million, or 6.0%, to $70.4 million in 2017 from $66.4 million in 2016 due to an increase in revenue per load. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2017 was achieved primarily through multiple cost control measures.\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the dollar and percentage increase or decrease of the items in our consolidated statements of operations, and those items as a percentage of operating revenue:\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits consist of compensation for our employees, including both driver and non-driver employees, employees' health insurance, 401(k) plan contributions and other fringe benefits. These expenses vary depending upon the size of our Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal tractor fleets, the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors, our efficiency, our experience with employees' health insurance claims, changes in health care premiums and other factors. Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased $1.3 million, or 0.6%, in 2017 from 2016. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2016 resulted primarily from an increase in non-driver bonus compensation expense of $2.3 million, partially offset by multiple other items.\nPurchased transportation consists of amounts payable to railroads and carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with Brokerage and Intermodal operations and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment. This category will vary depending upon the amount and rates, including fuel surcharges, we pay to third-party railroad and motor carriers, the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors and the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors. Purchased transportation expense increased $7.6 million in total, or 6.9%, in 2017 from 2016. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment increased $3.2 million to $58.6 million in 2017 from $55.4 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment increased $5.6 million to $51.5 million in 2017 from $45.9 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased intermodal revenue. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, decreased $1.2 million in 2017. We expect that purchased transportation expense will increase as we grow our Intermodal and Brokerage segments.\nFuel and fuel taxes increased by $11.3 million, or 12.0%, in 2017 from 2016. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) decreased $213,000, or 0.5%, to $46.8 million in 2017 from $47.0 million in 2016. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads increased to $8.6 million from $6.2 million in 2016. Despite an increase in the DOE national average cost of fuel to $2.65 per gallon from $2.30 per gallon in 2016, net fuel expense decreased to 8.4% of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 8.5% in 2016. The net fuel expense to revenue improved in 2017 primarily due to increases in our miles per gallon and in our revenue rate per mile. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers' fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. Auxiliary power units, which we have installed in our company-owned tractors, provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine.\nSupplies and maintenance consist of repairs, maintenance, tires, parts, oil and engine fluids, along with load-specific expenses including loading/unloading, tolls, pallets and trailer hostling. Our supplies and maintenance expense decreased $2.3 million, or 5.2%, from 2016 primarily due to decreased repair costs at external facilities and a reduction in parts costs.\nDepreciation relates to owned tractors, trailers, auxiliary power units, communication units, terminal facilities and other assets. The increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, which will result in greater depreciation over the useful life.\nInsurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and accruals we make for claims within our self-insured retention amounts, primarily for personal injury, property damage, physical damage to our equipment, cargo claims and workers' compensation claims. These expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience, our self-insured retention levels and the market for insurance. The $6.4 million increase in insurance and claims in 2017 was primarily due to increases in the cost of physical damage claims related to our tractors and trailers, in self-insured workers' compensation claims, and in auto liability insurance premiums. Our significant self-insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods which could materially impact our financial results depending on the frequency, severity and timing of claims.\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment decreased to $5.5 million in 2017 from $10.5 million in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the average gain for tractors and trailers within a soft equipment market. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control.\nThe $3.2 million decrease in other operating expenses in 2017 was primarily due to proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit, net of current period legal expenses, of $1.0 million, along with multiple cost control measures.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d was 91.9% in 2017 and 91.3% in 2016. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 93.1% in 2017 and 92.7% in 2016, for our Dedicated segment was 89.8% in 2017 and 87.6% in 2016, for our Intermodal segment was 89.7% in 2017 and 90.0% in 2016, and for our Brokerage segment was 92.7% in 2017 and 93.7% in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 91.0% in 2017 and 90.6% in 2016.\nThe decrease in our non-operating expense was primarily due to improved operating results in 2017 by MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a 45% owned affiliate.\nOur effective income tax rate decreased to (59.9%) in 2017 from 41.4% in 2016. We recorded a $56.5 million deferred income taxes benefit in 2017 to recognize the impact of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21% related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding that benefit, the effective tax rate was 40.1% in 2017. The decrease to 40.1% was due in part to certain federal employment tax credits realized as a discrete item and an excess tax benefit of $176,000 which was recorded as a decrease to the provision for income taxes in 2017 with the adoption of the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d in 2017. In addition to the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, which will lower our effective tax rate by 14 points beginning in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 establishes new tax laws that will affect us beginning in 2018 including, but not limited to, bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property and the repeal of like-kind exchanges.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income increased to $90.3 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, in 2017 from $33.5 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding the deferred income taxes benefit, 2017 net income improved 1.1% to $33.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, from 2016.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio by segment, along with the change for each component:\n\n (1) Represents operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue. \nOur operating revenue increased $6.2 million, or 0.9%, to $671.1 million in 2016 from $665.0 million in 2015, despite a 26.4% decrease in fuel surcharge revenue to $53.2 million from $72.3 million in 2015 due to lower fuel prices. Our operating revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and revenue from our dry container service discontinued in March 2015, increased $26.6 million, or 4.5%, to $617.9 million in 2016 from $591.3 million in 2015. This increase was due to a $39.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, partially offset by an $8.1 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $5.0 million decrease in Brokerage revenue, and a $49,000 decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and the discontinued dry container service.\nTruckload segment revenue decreased $22.5 million, or 5.7%, to $375.9 million in 2016 from $398.4 million in 2015. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $8.1 million, or 2.3%, to $340.0 million in 2016 from $348.1 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio in 2016 was also primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor within a continued soft freight market.\nDedicated segment revenue increased $39.1 million, or 33.1%, to $157.4 million in 2016 from $118.3 million in 2015. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 37.1% primarily due to an increase in our average fleet size of 36.7% driven by a significant increase in the number of Dedicated contracts we have with customers. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was achieved primarily through multiple cost control measures.\nIntermodal segment revenue decreased $5.5 million, or 7.1%, to $71.5 million in 2016 from $77.0 million in 2015. Intermodal segment revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and $1.3 million of revenue from our discontinued dry container service, decreased $49,000 from 2015 due to a decrease in volume. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was primarily due to the disposal of our dry container service, which produced a higher operating ratio than our temperature-controlled trailer service, and decreases in salaries, wages and benefits and depreciation expense, as the fleet size was reduced to optimize productivity.\nBrokerage segment revenue decreased $5.0 million, or 7.0%, to $66.4 million in 2016 from $71.4 million in 2015, due to a decrease in revenue per load, primarily caused by lower fuel surcharges. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was primarily driven by a decrease in the percentage of the amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged to our Brokerage revenue.\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the dollar and percentage increase or decrease of the items in our consolidated statements of operations, and those items as a percentage of operating revenue:\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense increased $15.4 million, or 7.3%, in 2016 from 2015. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2015 resulted primarily from a 6.3% increase in the total miles driven by company drivers and increases to several components of the amount paid to company drivers, along with an increase in employees' health insurance expense of $1.8 million due to an increase in our self-insured medical claims, partially offset by a decrease of $960,000 in bonus compensation expense for our non-driver employees.\nPurchased transportation expense decreased $7.3 million in total, or 6.2%, in 2016 from 2015. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment decreased $5.1 million to $55.4 million in 2016 from $60.5 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment decreased $3.4 million to $45.9 million in 2016 from $49.3 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreased revenue within our temperature-controlled intermodal trailer service, along with the disposal in March 2015 of the dry containers that were used in a portion of our intermodal operations. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, increased $1.2 million in 2016.\nFuel and fuel taxes decreased by $10.5 million, or 10.0%, in 2016 from 2015. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) increased $5.9 million, or 14.4%, to $47.0 million in 2016 from $41.1 million in 2015. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads decreased to $6.2 million from $8.9 million in 2015. Despite a decrease in the DOE national average cost of fuel to $2.30 per gallon from $2.71 per gallon in 2015, net fuel expense increased to 8.5% of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 7.9% in 2015. The net fuel expense to revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to our discount from retail being larger in 2015 as the result of a significant decrease in fuel prices during the first quarter, compared with level fuel prices in the first quarter of 2016. The discount from retail typically increases when prices decrease. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers' fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers.\nThe increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment and growth of our fleet.\nThe $3.0 million increase in insurance and claims in 2016 was primarily due to increases in self-insured auto liability claims and auto liability insurance premiums.\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment increased to $10.5 million in 2016 from $5.6 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in both the average gain per tractor and in the number of tractors sold.\nGain on disposition of facilities was $4.1 million in 2015. The disposition of the facilities, located in Ontario, CA and Indianapolis, IN, was part of our ongoing program to expand and update the footprint of our facilities throughout the United States, in which we have spent over $94 million since 2009. Any future gains or losses on disposition of facilities will be impacted by the market for real estate, which is beyond our control.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio,\u201d was 91.3% in 2016 and 90.8% in 2015. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 92.7% in 2016 and 91.1% in 2015, for our Dedicated segment was 87.6% in 2016 and 89.2% in 2015, for our Intermodal segment was 90.0% in 2016 and 93.7% in 2015, and for our Brokerage segment was 93.7% in 2016 and 94.7% in 2015. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 90.6% in 2016. Our operating ratio for 2015, net of both the gain on disposition of facilities and fuel surcharges, was 90.4%.\nThe increase in our non-operating expense was primarily due to increased losses in 2016 by MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a 45% owned affiliate.\nOur effective income tax rate increased slightly to 41.4% in 2016 from 41.1% in 2015.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income was $33.5 million in 2016 and $35.7 million in 2015. Net earnings per diluted share was $0.61 in 2016 and $0.64 in 2015. Net income in 2016 improved 0.4% over earnings of $33.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in 2015 excluding the gain on disposition of facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. Our primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations and our revolving credit facility. A portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. We have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractors or obtain financing through third parties.\nThe table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used for investing activities and net cash flows used for financing activities for the years indicated.\n\nIn December 2007, our Board of Directors approved and we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock either through purchases on the open market or through private transactions and in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an increase in the share repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to $40 million, or approximately 2 million shares, of our common stock, which was increased by our Board of Directors to 3.3 million shares on August 15, 2017 to reflect the five-for-three stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on July 7, 2017. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nWe repurchased and retired 759,302 shares of our common stock for $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 and did not repurchase any shares in the last three quarters of 2016 or in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2015 we repurchased and retired 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $16.2 million.\nIn 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $121.9 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $87.6 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $7.9 million of long-term debt, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.8 million, and to pay cash dividends of $4.4 million, resulting in a $15.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. In 2016, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $133.8 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $89.9 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.1 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $30.0 million of long-term debt, to repurchase and retire 759,302 shares of our common stock for $7.5 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. In 2015, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $128.7 million and net borrowings under our credit facility of $13.5 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $118.2 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $8.6 million, to repurchase and retire 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $16.2 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. Our net cash flows beginning in 2018 will be increased by the new tax laws established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which reduce the federal corporate statutory income tax rate and establish bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified assets, partially offset by the repeal of like-kind exchanges.\nWe estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately $115 million in 2018. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each of the first two quarters of 2017 along with dividends of $0.025 per share in each of 2017's last two quarters, which totaled $4.4 million. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2016 and 2015 and totaled $3.3 million in each of the two years. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. The payment of cash dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, and certain corporate law requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nWe maintain a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured committed credit facility which matures in December 2019. In April 2016, we elected to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the facility from $75.0 million to $30.0 million. In December 2016, we entered into an amendment to the facility which increased the aggregate principal amount to $40.0 million. At December 31, 2017, there was no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims of $12.9 million and remaining borrowing availability of $27.1 million. This facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or the lender's Prime Rate, in each case plus/minus applicable margins.\nOur credit facility prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of 25% of our net income from the prior fiscal year. A waiver of the 25% limitation for 2016 was obtained from the lender. This facility also contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, require us to maintain compliance with cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017.\n\nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows, the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2017 of 175,449 shares of Company common stock with a value of $3.6 million has been excluded from the above table.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than standby letters of credit maintained in connection with our self-insurance programs in the amount of $12.9 million along with purchase obligations and operating leases summarized above in our summary of contractual obligations, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017.\nInflation and Fuel Costs\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. During the past three years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices, accident claims, health insurance and employee compensation. We attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts.\nIn addition to inflation, fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability. We require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature-control units on our trailers. Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions. Although we historically have been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges and higher rates, such increases usually are not fully recovered. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling.\nSeasonality\nOur tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, lower fuel efficiency and more equipment repairs.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue, including fuel surcharges, at the time shipment of freight is completed. We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor in the arrangements, we have the ability to establish prices, we have the risk of loss in the event of cargo claims and we bear credit risk with customer payments. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The FASB has also issued, along with other additional guidance related to revenue recognition matters, ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).\u201d The standards, which are effective for the first quarter of 2018, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and will require additional disclosures. The new standards will require us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four segments over time, compared with our current policy in which we record revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight is completed. Our current policy in which we account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis is appropriate under the new standards.\nAccounts Receivable. We are dependent upon a limited number of customers, and, as a result, our trade accounts receivable are highly concentrated. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $300,000 as of December 31, 2017 and $275,000 as of December 31, 2016. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances, including any billing disputes. In order to assess the collectibility of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best information available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. We evaluate the allowance based on historical write-off experience, the size of the individual customer balances, past-due amounts and the overall national economy. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly.\nProperty and Equipment. The transportation industry requires significant capital investments. Our net property and equipment was $571.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and $557.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Our depreciation expense was $85.1 million in 2017, $82.4 million in 2016 and $75.3 million in 2015. We compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset, reduced by its estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. We determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment, prior useful lives and changes in technology. We have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers within the last ten years. We believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A 5% decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of December 31, 2017 by approximately $11.1 million, or 1.9%.\nImpairment of Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.\nInsurance and Claims. We self-insure, in part, for losses relating to workers' compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, along with employees' health insurance with varying risk retention levels. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review. However, we could suffer a series of losses within our self-insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. We are responsible for the first $1.0 million on each auto liability claim and for the first $750,000 on each workers' compensation claim. We have $12.9 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. The insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated balance sheets were $26.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and $19.4 million as of December 31, 2016. We reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims. We periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical development. Actual results could differ from these current estimates. In addition, to the extent that claims are litigated and not settled, jury awards are difficult to predict.\nShare-based Payment Arrangement Compensation. We have granted stock options to certain employees and non-employee directors. We recognize compensation expense for all stock options net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only record compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (normally the vesting period). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock options require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock options and stock price volatility. We use the Black-Scholes model to value our stock option awards. We believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility. Thus, we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, stock option compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nWe have also granted performance unit awards to certain employees which are subject to vesting requirements over a five-year period, primarily based on our earnings growth. The fair value of each performance unit is based on the closing market price on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for these awards based on the estimated number of units probable of achieving the performance and service vesting requirements of the awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the respective dates of adoption and effect on our results of operations and financial position.",
