This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Condition\nAFG is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries. AFG, however, has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses, the payment of principal and interest on borrowings, shareholder dividends, and taxes. Therefore, certain analyses are most meaningfully presented on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis. In addition, because most of its businesses are financial in nature, AFG does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current-noncurrent format. Consequently, certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful.\nAt December 31, 2015, AFG (parent) held approximately $252 million in cash and securities and had $500 million available under a bank line of credit expiring in December 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThrough the operations of its subsidiaries, AFG is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses and in the sale of fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets.\nFourth quarter 2015 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $129 million ($1.45 per share, diluted) compared to $127 million ($1.41 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher underwriting profit in the property and casualty insurance segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher net operating earnings in the annuity segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>improved core net operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fourth quarter loss reported upon closing of the sale of the long-term care business, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>realized losses on securities in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to realized gains in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFull year 2015 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $352 million ($3.94 per share, diluted) compared to $452 million ($4.97 per share) in 2014, reflecting:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher core underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher special A&E charges recorded in 2015 compared to 2014,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>improved core net operating earnings in the run-off long-term care and life segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Le Pavillon Hotel,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care business, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>realized losses on securities in 2015 compared to realized gains in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSignificant accounting policies are summarized in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions change and, thus, impact amounts reported in the future. The areas where management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements is most significant are as follows:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the establishment of insurance reserves, especially asbestos and environmental-related reserves,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the recoverability of reinsurance,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves of former railroad and manufacturing operations, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the valuation of investments, including the determination of other-than-temporary\u201d impairments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uncertainties\u201d for a discussion of insurance reserves, recoverables from reinsurers, and contingencies related to American Premier's former operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments\u201d for a discussion of impairments on investments. DPAC and certain liabilities related to annuities and universal life insurance products are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies. Assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management's estimates of interest rates and investment spreads, surrenders, annuitizations, renewal premiums and mortality. Should actual experience require management to change its assumptions (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust DPAC or annuity liabilities to the levels they would have been if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRatios AFG's debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below (dollars in millions). Management intends to maintain the ratio of debt to capital at or below 25% and intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at or above levels currently indicated by rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings. Table 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of debt to total capital:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Including subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratio of debt to total capital is a non-GAAP measure that management believes is useful for investors, analysts and independent ratings agencies to evaluate AFG's financial strength and liquidity and to provide insight into how AFG finances its operations. The ratio is calculated by dividing AFG's long-term debt by its total capital, which includes long-term debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders' equity (excluding unrealized gains (losses) related to fixed maturity investments and appropriated retained earnings related to managed investment entities).\nAFG's ratio of earnings to fixed charges, including annuity benefits as a fixed charge, was 1.66 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding annuity benefits, this ratio was 6.58. Although the ratio excluding annuity benefits is not\nrequired or encouraged to be disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company.\nThe NAIC's model law for risk based capital ( RBC\u201d) applies to both life and property and casualty companies. RBC formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs so that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired. At December 31, 2015, the capital ratios of all AFG insurance companies substantially exceeded the RBC requirements.\nCondensed Consolidated Cash Flows AFG's principal sources of cash include insurance premiums, income from its investment portfolio and proceeds from the maturities, redemptions and sales of investments. Insurance premiums in excess of acquisition expenses and operating costs are invested until they are needed to meet policyholder obligations or made available to the parent company through dividends to cover debt obligations and corporate expenses, and to provide returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. AFG's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as detailed in its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are shown below (in millions):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,577\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,619\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>3,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities AFG's property and casualty insurance operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as premiums collected and investment income exceed policy acquisition costs, claims payments and operating expenses. AFG's net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by the level and timing of property and casualty premiums, claim and expense payments and recoveries from reinsurers. AFG's annuity operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as investment income exceeds acquisition costs and operating expenses. Interest credited on annuity policyholder funds is a non-cash increase in AFG's annuity benefits accumulated liability and annuity premiums, benefits and withdrawals are considered financing activities due to the deposit-type nature of annuities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.36 billion, $1.22 billion and $760 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities AFG's investing activities consist primarily of the investment of funds provided by its property and casualty and annuity products. Net cash used in investing activities was $4.58 billion in 2015 compared to $3.62 billion in 2014, an increase of $958 million. The $537 million increase in net cash flows from annuity policyholders in 2015 as compared to 2014 (discussed below under net cash provided by financing activities) increased the amount of cash available for investment in 2015 compared to 2014. In addition to the investment of funds provided by the insurance operations, investing activities also include the purchase and disposal of managed investment entity investments (collateralized loan obligations), which are presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $675 million use of cash in 2015 compared to a $275 million use of cash in 2014, accounting for a $400 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.62 billion in 2014 compared to $2.92 billion in 2013, an increase of $704 million. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $275 million use of cash in 2014 compared to a $478 million source of cash in 2013, accounting for a $753 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities AFG's financing activities consist primarily of transactions with annuity policyholders, issuances and retirements of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.10 billion in 2015 compared to $2.10 billion in 2014, an increase of $996 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $2.50 billion in 2015 compared to $1.97 billion in 2014, resulting in a $537 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities. Redemptions of long-term debt resulted in a $192 million use of cash in 2015. AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in 2015 and $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in 2014, the net proceeds of each issuance contributed $145 million to net cash provided by financing activities in those years. During 2015, AFG repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $126 million compared to 3.3 million shares repurchased in 2014 for $191 million, which accounted for a $65 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. Financing activities also include issuances and\nretirements of managed investment entity liabilities, which are nonrecourse to AFG and presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $890 million in 2015 while issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $306 million in 2014, accounting for a $584 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. See Managed Investment Entities in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2.10 billion in 2014 compared to $2.09 billion in 2013, an increase of $12 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $1.97 billion in 2014 compared to $2.68 billion in 2013, resulting in a $711 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities. During 2014, AFG repurchased 3.3 million shares of its Common Stock for $191 million compared to 1.4 million shares repurchased in 2013 for $70 million, which accounted for a $121 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013. AFG issued $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in 2014, the net proceeds of which contributed $145 million to net cash provided by financing activities. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $306 million in 2014 while retirements of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded issuances by $368 million in 2013, accounting for a $674 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013.\nParent and Subsidiary Liquidity\nParent Holding Company Liquidity Management believes AFG has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements. If funds generated from operations, including dividends, tax payments and borrowings from subsidiaries, are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period, AFG would be required to utilize parent company cash and marketable securities or to generate cash through borrowings, sales of other assets, or similar transactions.\nAFG can borrow up to $500 million under its revolving credit facility which expires in December 2016. Amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 1.00% to 1.875% (currently 1.375%) over LIBOR based on AFG's credit rating. There were no borrowings under this agreement, or under any other parent company short-term borrowing arrangements, during 2015.\nIn November 2015, AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures due 2055. AFG intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchases of outstanding common stock. In September 2015, AFG redeemed its $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par using cash on hand at the parent company.\nDuring 2015, AFG repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $126 million. In December 2015, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million. In January 2016, AFG repurchased 951,394 additional shares of its Common Stock for $64 million.\nIn April 2014, AFG completed the purchase of Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and its related companies ( Summit\u201d) from Liberty Mutual Insurance for $259 million using cash on hand at the parent company. In addition, AFG made a capital contribution of approximately $140 million, bringing its capital investment in the Summit business to $399 million. Summit's results of operations are included in AFG's consolidated results beginning in April of 2014.\nIn September 2014, AFG issued $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures due 2054. During 2014, AFG repurchased 3.3 million shares of its Common Stock for $191 million. In December 2014, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nDuring 2013, AFG repurchased 1.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $70 million. In December 2013, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $89 million.\nAll debentures and notes issued by AFG are rated investment grade by two nationally recognized rating agencies. Under a currently effective shelf registration statement, AFG can offer additional equity or debt securities. The shelf registration provides AFG with flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit.\nUnder a tax allocation agreement with AFG, its 80%-owned U.S. subsidiaries generally pay taxes to (or recover taxes from) AFG based on each subsidiary's contribution to amounts due under AFG's consolidated tax return.\nSubsidiary Liquidity Great American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC\u201d), a wholly-owned annuity subsidiary, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati ( FHLB\u201d). The FHLB makes advances and provides other banking services to\nmember institutions, which provides the annuity operations with a substantial additional source of liquidity. These advances further the FHLB's mission of improving access to housing by increasing liquidity in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. At December 31, 2015, GALIC had $785 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB (included in annuity benefits accumulated), bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.02% to 0.49% over LIBOR (average rate of 0.58% at December 31, 2015). While these advances must be repaid between 2016 and 2020, GALIC has the option to prepay all or a portion of the advances. GALIC has invested the proceeds from the advances in fixed maturity securities for the purpose of earning a spread over the interest payments due to the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, GALIC estimated that it had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $750 million from the FHLB.\nNational Interstate Corporation ( NATL\u201d), a 51%-owned property and casualty insurance subsidiary, can borrow up to $100 million under its unsecured credit agreement, which expires in November 2017. There was $12 million borrowed under this agreement at December 31, 2015, bearing interest at 1.40% (six-month LIBOR plus 0.875%). The maximum outstanding balance in 2015 was $12 million.\nThe liquidity requirements of AFG's insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses, payments of dividends and taxes to AFG and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries. Historically, cash flows from premiums and investment income have generally provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements. Funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities. In addition, the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid, short-term investments.\nThe excess cash flow of AFG's property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves.\nIn the annuity business, where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities, the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities. In a rising interest rate environment, significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on AFG's annuity products. With declining rates, AFG receives some protection (from spread compression) due to the ability to lower crediting rates, subject to contractually guaranteed minimum interest rates ( GMIRs\u201d). AFG began selling policies with GMIRs below 2% in 2003; almost all new business since late 2010 has been issued with a 1% GMIR. At December 31, 2015, AFG could reduce the average crediting rate on approximately $20 billion of traditional fixed and fixed-indexed deferred annuities without guaranteed withdrawal benefits by approximately 72 basis points (on a weighted average basis). Annuity policies are subject to Guaranteed Minimum Interest Rates ( GMIRs\u201d) at policy issuance. The table below shows the breakdown of annuity reserves by GMIR. The current interest crediting rates on substantially all of AFG's annuities with a GMIR of 3% or higher are at their minimum.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>at December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>GMIR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1 - 1.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2 - 2.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>3 - 3.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4.00% and above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Annuity benefits accumulated (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$23,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor statutory accounting purposes, equity securities of non-affiliates and equity call options used in the fixed-indexed annuity business are generally carried at fair value. At December 31, 2015, AFG's insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a fair value of $1.67 billion and equity call options with a fair value of $241 million. In addition, GAI's investment in NATL common stock had a fair value of $272 million and a statutory carrying value of $217 million at December 31, 2015. Decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group's capital, potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution. Conversely, increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group's dividend-paying capability.\nAFG believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses. In addition, these subsidiaries have sufficient capital to meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies, inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies. Nonetheless, changes in statutory accounting rules, significant declines in the fair value of the insurance subsidiaries' investment portfolios or significant ratings downgrades on these investments, could create a need for additional capital.\nCondensed Parent Only Cash Flows AFG's parent holding company only condensed cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are shown below (in millions):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(232\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(231\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nParent Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Parent holding company cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of dividends and tax payments received from AFG's insurance subsidiaries, reduced by tax payments to the IRS and holding company interest and other expenses. Parent holding company net cash provided by operating activities was $162 million in 2015 compared to $372 million in 2014 and $428 million in 2013. Lower dividends from subsidiaries received in 2015 as compared to 2014 and 2014 as compared to 2013 were the primary driver of the $210 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 and the $56 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013.\nParent Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Parent holding company investing activities consist of capital contributions to and returns of capital from subsidiaries and, to a much lesser extent, parent company investment activity. Parent holding company net cash used in investing activities was $33 million in 2015 compared to $432 million in 2014 and $4 million in 2013. The $33 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 and the $4 million in 2013 are significantly lower than the $432 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 due primarily to capital contributions made to a subsidiary to fund the $399 million investment in Summit in 2014.\nParent Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Parent company financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of AFG Common Stock, dividends to shareholders, the issuance and retirement of long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Significant long-term debt and common stock transactions are discussed above under Parent Holding Company Liquidity.\u201d Parent holding company net cash used in financing activities was $232 million in 2015 compared to $171 million in 2014 and $180 million in 2013. The $61 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects the 2015 redemption of $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050, partially offset by a $65 million decrease in common stock repurchases. The $9 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 reflects net proceeds of $145 million received in 2014 from the issuance of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures due in 2054, partially offset by a $121 million increase in common stock repurchases.\nContractual Obligations The following table shows an estimate (based on historical patterns and expected trends) of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities, as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations (in millions).

In addition, $254 million in fixed maturities and $166 million in equity securities were classified as trading with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses included in net investment income.\nAs detailed in Note E - Investments - Net Unrealized Gain on Marketable Securities\u201d to the financial statements, unrealized gains and losses on AFG's fixed maturity and equity securities are included in shareholders' equity after adjustments for related changes in DPAC and certain liabilities related to annuity, long-term care and life businesses, noncontrolling interests and deferred income taxes. DPAC and certain other balance sheet amounts applicable to annuity, long-term care and life businesses are adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding increases or decreases (net of tax) included in accumulated other comprehensive income in AFG's Balance Sheet.\nFixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate-term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions. At December 31, 2015, the average life of AFG's fixed maturities was about 6-1/2 years.\nFair values for AFG's portfolio are determined by AFG's internal investment professionals using data from nationally recognized pricing services as well as non-binding broker quotes. Fair values of equity securities are generally based on published closing prices. For mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), which comprise approximately 18% of AFG's fixed maturities, prices for each security are generally obtained from both pricing services and broker quotes. For the remainder of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio, approximately 80% are priced using pricing services and the balance is priced primarily by\nusing non-binding broker quotes. When prices obtained for the same security vary, AFG's internal investment professionals select the price they believe is most indicative of an exit price.\nThe pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis. Based upon information provided by the pricing services, these inputs include, but are not limited to, recent reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids or offers, reference data, and measures of volatility. Included in the pricing of MBS are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on brokers' prices are classified as Level 3 in the GAAP hierarchy unless the price can be corroborated, for example, by comparison to similar securities priced using observable inputs.\nValuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by AFG's internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price. To validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained, these investment managers consider widely published indices (as benchmarks), recent trades, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers. In addition, AFG communicates directly with pricing services regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing, including verifying, on a test basis, the inputs used by the services to value specific securities.\nIn general, the fair value of AFG's fixed maturity investments is inversely correlated to changes in interest rates. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of such fair values to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on AFG's fixed maturity portfolio and accumulated other comprehensive income that an immediate increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions). Effects of increases or decreases from the 100 basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage impact on fair value of 100 bps increase in interest rates\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax impact on fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offsetting adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and other balance sheet amounts\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated pretax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>(927\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated after-tax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(589\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately 89% of the fixed maturities held by AFG at December 31, 2015, were rated investment grade\u201d (credit rating of AAA to BBB) by nationally recognized rating agencies. Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated and non-investment grade. Management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return.\nMBS are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that, in periods of declining interest rates, mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. Although interest rates have been low in recent years, tighter lending standards have resulted in fewer buyers being able to refinance the mortgages underlying much of AFG's non-agency residential MBS portfolio.\nSummarized information for AFG's MBS (including those classified as trading) at December 31, 2015, is shown in the table below (dollars in millions). Agency-backed securities are those issued by a U.S. government-backed agency; Alt-A mortgages are those with risk profiles between prime and subprime. The majority of the Alt-A securities and substantially all of the subprime securities are backed by fixed-rate mortgages. The average life of the residential and commercial MBS is approximately 4-1/2 years and 3 years, respectively.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value as\n% of Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized\nGain (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Rated\nInvestment\nGrade\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency-backed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-agency prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subprime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d) assigns creditworthiness designations on a scale of 1 to 6 with 1 being the highest quality and 6 being the lowest quality. The NAIC retains third-party investment management firms to assist in the determination of appropriate NAIC designations for mortgage-backed securities based not only on the probability of loss (which is the primary basis of ratings by the major ratings firms), but also on the severity of loss and statutory carrying value. At December 31, 2015, 97% (based on statutory carrying value of $5.28 billion) of AFG's MBS securities had an NAIC designation of 1.\nMunicipal bonds represented approximately 21% of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2015. AFG's municipal bond portfolio is high quality, with 98% of the securities rated investment grade at that date. The portfolio is well diversified across the states of issuance and individual issuers. At December 31, 2015, approximately 75% of the municipal bond portfolio was held in revenue bonds, with the remaining 25% held in general obligation bonds. General obligation securities of California, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Puerto Rico collectively represented approximately 1% of this portfolio.\nSummarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in AFG's Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015, is shown in the following table (dollars in millions).

a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other-than-temporary,\u201d a provision for impairment is charged to earnings (accounted for as a realized loss) and the cost basis of that investment is reduced by the amount of the charge. The determination of whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary\u201d requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors.

Although AFG has the ability to continue holding its investments with unrealized losses, its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers' creditworthiness, decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry, asset/liability management decisions, market movements, changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains. Should AFG's ability or intent change with regard to a particular security, a charge for impairment would likely be required. While it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired, charges for other-than-temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in future periods. Significant declines in the fair value of AFG's investment portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on AFG's liquidity. For information on AFG's realized gains (losses) on securities, including charges for other-than-temporary\u201d impairment, see Results of Operations - Consolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities.\u201d\nUncertainties As more fully explained in the following paragraphs, management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation. Determining the liability is a complex process incorporating input from many areas of the Company including actuarial, underwriting, pricing, claims and operations management.\nThe estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon: (i) the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written ( case reserves\u201d); (ii) estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations; (iii) estimates of claims incurred but not reported or IBNR\u201d (including possible development on known claims); (iv) estimates (based on experience) of expense for investigating and adjusting claims; and (v) the current state of law and coverage litigation.\nThe process used to determine the total reserve for liabilities involves estimating the ultimate incurred losses and LAE, adjusted for amounts already paid on the claims. The IBNR reserve is derived by first estimating the ultimate unpaid reserve liability and subtracting case reserves for loss and LAE.\nIn determining management's best estimate of the ultimate liability, management (including Company actuaries) considers items such as the effect of inflation on medical, hospitalization, material, repair and replacement costs, the nature and maturity of lines of insurance, general economic trends and the legal environment. In addition, historical trends adjusted for changes in underwriting standards, policy provisions, product mix and other factors are analyzed using actuarial reserve development techniques. Weighing all of the factors, the management team determines a single or point\u201d estimate that it records as its best estimate of the ultimate liability. Ranges of loss reserves are not developed by Company actuaries. This reserve analysis and review is completed each quarter and for almost every line of business.\nEach quarterly review includes in-depth analysis of several hundred subdivisions of the business, employing multiple actuarial techniques. For each subdivision, actuaries use informed, professional judgment to adjust these techniques as necessary to respond to specific conditions in the data or within the business.\nSome of the standard actuarial methods employed for the quarterly reserve analysis may include (but may not be limited to):\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Case Incurred Development Method\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Paid Development Method\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Incremental Paid LAE to Paid Loss Methods\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes that each method has particular strengths and weaknesses and that no single estimation method is most accurate in all situations. When applied to a particular group of claims, the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method can change over time based on the facts and circumstances. Ultimately, the estimation methods chosen are those which management believes produce the most reliable indication for the particular liabilities under review.\nThe period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability is referred to as the tail\u201d. Generally, the same actuarial methods are considered for both short-tail and long-tail lines of business because most of them work properly for both. The methods are designed to incorporate the effects of the differing length of time to settle particular claims. For short-tail lines, management tends to give more weight to the Case Incurred and Paid Development methods, although the various\nmethods tend to produce similar results. For long-tail lines, more judgment is involved, and more weight may be given to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. Liability claims for long-tail lines are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation and the legal environment. Therefore, the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability.\nThe level of detail in which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business. Data is generally analyzed by major product or by coverage within product, using countrywide data; however, in some situations, data may be reviewed by state or region. Appropriate segmentation of the data is determined based on data credibility, homogeneity of development patterns, mix of business, and other actuarial considerations.\nSupplementary statistical information is also reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate to use or if adjustments are needed to particular methods. Such information includes:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Open and closed claim counts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Average case reserves and average incurred on open claims\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Average closed claim severity\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ultimate claim severity\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reported loss ratios\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Projected ultimate loss ratios\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Loss payment patterns\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWithin each line, results of individual methods are reviewed, supplementary statistical information is analyzed, and data from underwriting, operating and claim management are considered in deriving management's best estimate of the ultimate liability.

As shown in the reserve development table (loss triangle) on page 7, the original estimates of AFG's liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance and including the effect of special charges for asbestos and environmental exposures, over the past 10 years have developed through December 31, 2015, to be deficient (for four years) by as much as 1.8% and\nredundant (for six years) by as much as 13.3%. Excluding the effect of special charges for asbestos and environmental exposures, the original estimates of AFG's liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance have developed through December 31, 2015 to be redundant (for ten years) by as much as 19.4%. This development illustrates the historical impact caused by variability in factors considered in estimating insurance reserves.\nFollowing is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves of the more significant long-tail lines of business (asbestos and environmental liabilities are separately discussed below). Many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs.\nAn important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future. However, future results could vary due to an unexpected change in the underlying cost trends. This unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation, inflation from social programs, new medical technologies, or other factors such as those listed below in connection with AFG's largest lines of business. It is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables, and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables. However, it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall 1% change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables. Utilizing the effect of a 1% change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than 1% to be estimated by extrapolation. Each additional 1% change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly (about 5%) greater than the effect of the previous 1%. For example, if a 1% change in cost trends in a line of business would change net earnings by $20 million, a 2% change would change net earnings by approximately $41 million.\nThe estimated cumulative impact that a 1% change in cost trends in AFG's more significant lines of property and casualty business (exceeding 5% of total reserves) would have on net earnings is shown below (in millions).

The following table shows (dollars in millions) what the impact on AFG's net earnings would be on the more significant lines of business if the December 31, 2015, reserves (net of reinsurance) developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5-yr.

Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers' compensation include:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Legislative actions and regulatory and legal interpretations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Future medical cost inflation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic conditions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Timing of claims reporting\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn April 2014, AFG acquired Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and related companies, a leading provider of workers' compensation solutions in the southeastern United States. The Summit acquisition significantly increased AFG's volume of workers' compensation business and improved its geographic diversity. Approximately 23% and 19% of AFG's workers' compensation reserves at December 31, 2015 relate to policies written in Florida and California, respectively. Over the past 12 years in both states, there have been numerous revisions to workers' compensation regulations and operating environments, adding difficulty and uncertainty to the estimation of related liabilities.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $45 million in 2015 due to lower than anticipated claim severity across all regions of the country. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in both 2014 and 2013, as favorable reserve development in the business written in California was partially offset by adverse reserve development in other states.\nOther Liability - Occurrence\nThis long-tail line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence, carelessness, or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - occurrence include:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigious climate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Magnitude of jury awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Outside counsel costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Timing of claims reporting\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in 2015, $15 million in 2014 and $11 million in 2013 related to its other liability - occurrence coverage where both the frequency and severity of claims in excess and umbrella liability coverages were lower than previously projected.\nWhile management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above, more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held. For recent accident years, more weight is given to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.\nCommercial Auto/Truck Liability/Medical\nThis line of business is a mix of coverage protecting the insured against legal liability for property damage or personal injury to others arising from the operation of commercial motor vehicles. The property damage liability exposure is usually short-tail with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims. The bodily injury and medical payments exposures are longer-tailed; although the claim reporting is relatively quick, the final settlement can take longer to achieve. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto/truck liability/medical are similar to other liability - occurrence and include:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Magnitude of jury awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigious climate and trends\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Change in frequency of severe accidents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Health care costs and utilization of medical services by injured parties\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $20 million in 2015, $28 million in 2014 and $37 million in 2013 for this line of business as claim severity has been significantly higher than expected in accident years 2010 and subsequent.\nOther Liability - Claims Made\nThis long-tail line of business consists mostly of directors' and officers' liability ( D&O\u201d). Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - claims made include:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigious climate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic conditions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Variability of stock prices\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Magnitude of jury awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits and other situations that trigger coverage under D&O policies. For example, from 2008 to 2010,\neconomic conditions led to higher frequency of claims, particularly in the D&O policies for small account and not-for-profit organizations. Since then, claim frequency has continually decreased from its peak in 2010, offsetting increased claim severity.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $12 million in 2015, $18 million in 2014 and $41 million in 2013 on its D&O business as claim severity was less than expected across several prior accident years.\nWhile management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above, more judgment may be needed to determine appropriate reserves due to the complexity of claims, litigation and the length of time necessary to determine exposure.\nReserves of Foreign Operations\nReserves of foreign operations relate primarily to the operations of Marketform Group, Limited, AFG's wholly-owned United Kingdom-based Lloyd's insurer. Historically, the largest line of business written by Marketform has been non-U.S. medical malpractice, which provides coverage for injuries and damages caused by medical care providers, including but not limited to, hospitals and their physicians. Although Marketform offers this product in approximately 30 countries, the majority of the business has been written in the United Kingdom, Australia and Italy. In addition, Marketform writes general liability, marine, equine, professional indemnity and directors and officers liability insurance. Significant variables in estimating the loss reserves include:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigious environment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Magnitude of court awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A slow moving judicial system including varying approaches to medical malpractice claims among courts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Trends in claim costs, including medical cost inflation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketform recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $44 million in 2015, $14 million in 2014 and $1 million in 2013. The adverse development in 2015 and 2014 was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, primarily Dutch hospital medical malpractice, Australian and other general liability and personal accident insurance. In October of 2015, AFG announced the hiring of a new management team at Marketform with extensive underwriting experience in the Lloyd's market. The new management is in the process of evaluating Marketform's operational structure and lines of business with the goal of improving the profitability of these operations.\nRecoverables from Reinsurers and Availability of Reinsurance AFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as reinsurance contracts do not relieve AFG of its liability to policyholders. To mitigate this risk, substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S&P ratings or is secured by funds withheld\u201d or other collateral.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which are beyond AFG's control and which may affect AFG's level of business and profitability. Although the cost of certain reinsurance programs may increase, management believes that AFG will be able to maintain adequate reinsurance coverage at acceptable rates without a material adverse effect on AFG's results of operations. AFG's gross and net combined ratios are shown in the table below.\nSee Item 1 - Business - Property and Casualty Insurance Segment - Reinsurance\u201d for more information on AFG's reinsurance programs. For additional information on the effect of reinsurance on AFG's historical results of operations see Note O - Insurance - Reinsurance\u201d to the financial statements and the gross loss development table under Item 1 - Business - Property and Casualty Insurance Segment - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.\u201d\nThe following table illustrates the effect that purchasing property and casualty reinsurance has had on AFG's combined ratio over the last three years.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Before reinsurance (gross)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual (net of reinsurance)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutside of its property and casualty operations, AFG also has reinsurance recoverables totaling $355 million, including$315 million related to the run-off life business. These recoverables include $184 million from Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America (rated A+ by A.M. Best).\nAsbestos and Environmental-related ( A&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves Asbestos and environmental reserves of the property and casualty group consisted of the following (in millions):\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A&E reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance recoverable, net of allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross A&E reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsbestos reserves include claims asserting alleged injuries and damages from exposure to asbestos. Environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted waste sites.\nAsbestos claims against manufacturers, distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of their policies which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer's liability. In recent years, a number of asbestos claims are being presented as non-products\u201d claims, such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property, under the premises or operations section of their policies. Unlike products exposures, these non-products exposures typically had no aggregate limits, creating potentially greater exposure for insurers. Further, in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage, some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non-products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non-products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits. AFG, along with other insurers, is and will be subject to such non-products claims. It is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non-products coverage or whether AFG and other insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses. Therefore, the future impact of such efforts is uncertain.\nApproximately 43% of AFG's net asbestos reserves relate to policies written directly by AFG subsidiaries. Claims from these policies generally are product oriented claims with only a limited amount of non-products exposures, and are dominated by small to mid-sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants. The remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods 1954 to 1983. The asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties. A majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than $100,000 to AFG. Asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers, distributors and installers. Pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites.\nEstablishing reserves for A&E claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims. For this group of claims, traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a range of reasonably possible losses cannot be estimated. Case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified. In addition to the case reserves established for known claims, management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims. These additional reserves are management's best estimate based on periodic comprehensive studies and internal reviews adjusted for payments and identifiable changes, supplemented by management's review of industry information about such claims, with due consideration to individual claim situations.\nManagement believes that estimating the ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, novel theories of coverage, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. The casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase. Environmental claims likewise present challenges in prediction, due to uncertainty regarding the interpretation of insurance policies, complexities regarding multi-party involvements at sites, evolving cleanup standards and protracted time periods required to assess the level of cleanup required at contaminated sites.\nThe following factors could impact AFG's reserves and payments:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>There is a growing interest at the state level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved.

A 1% variation in loss cost trends, caused by any of the factors previously described, would change net income by approximately $20 million.\nAFG tracks its A&E claims by policyholder. The following table shows, by type of claim, the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment. Policyholder counts represent policies written by AFG subsidiaries and do not include assumed reinsurance.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of policyholders with no indemnity payments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of policyholders with indemnity payments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts paid (net of reinsurance recoveries) for asbestos and environmental claims, including loss adjustment expenses, were as follows (in millions):\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos - two large claims (*)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos - other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>Asbestos claims paid in 2013 include payments totaling $106 million associated with the settlement of A.P.

This ratio is typically calculated by dividing reserves for A&E exposures by the three year average of paid losses, and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to pay off current reserves based on recent average payments. Because this ratio can be significantly impacted by a number of factors such as loss payout variability, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy based simply on the survival ratio. At December 31, 2015, the property and casualty insurance segment's three year survival ratios, excluding amounts associated with the settlements of A.P. Green Industries and another large claim, were 14.8 times paid losses for the asbestos reserves, 8.2 times paid losses for environmental reserves and 11.4 times paid losses for total A&E reserves. Overall, these ratios compare favorably with data published by A.M. Best in October 2015, which indicate that industry survival ratios were 8.8 for asbestos, 6.3 for environmental, and 8.2 for total A&E reserves at December 31, 2014.\nAFG has periodically conducted comprehensive external studies of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run-off operations of its property and casualty insurance segment and exposures related to its former railroad and manufacturing operations with the aid of specialty actuarial, engineering and consulting firms and outside counsel, generally every two years, with an in-depth internal review during the intervening years.\nAs a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2015, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $67 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $25 million (net of reinsurance) and its\nenvironmental reserves by $42 million (net of reinsurance). As the overall industry exposure to asbestos has matured, the focus of litigation has shifted to smaller companies and companies with ancillary exposures. AFG's insureds with these exposures have been the driver of the property and casualty segment's asbestos reserve increases in recent years; AFG has seen increased estimates for indemnity and defense compared to prior studies. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased. As in past years, there were no new or emerging broad industry trends that were identified in this study.\nAn in-depth internal review of AFG's A&E reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2014 by AFG's internal A&E claims specialists and actuaries in consultation with specialty outside counsel and an outside consultant. As a result of the review, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $24 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $4 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $20 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to AFG's increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nAs a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2013, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $54 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $16 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $38 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in the property and casualty segment's asbestos reserves was driven primarily by slightly higher than expected loss experience, higher defense costs and some increased claim severity. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to a small number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nContingencies related to Subsidiaries' Former Operations The A&E studies and reviews discussed above encompassed reserves for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations disposed of by American Premier's predecessor and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by American Premier and its subsidiaries and by Great American Financial Resources, Inc. Charges resulting from the A&E studies and review were $12 million in 2015, $6 million in 2014 and $22 million in 2013. For a discussion of the charges recorded for those operations, see Holding Company, Other and Unallocated - Results of Operations.\u201d Liabilities for claims and contingencies arising from these former railroad and manufacturing operations totaled $88 million at December 31, 2015. For a discussion of the uncertainties in determining the ultimate liability, see Note M - Contingencies\u201d to the financial statements.\nRun-off Long-term Care Insurance AFG, as well as other companies that sell long-term care products, have accumulated relatively limited claims, lapse and mortality experience, making it difficult to predict future claims. Long-term care claims tend to be much higher in dollar amount and longer in duration than other health care products. In addition, long-term care claims are incurred much later in the life of a policy than most other health products. These factors made it difficult to appropriately price this product and were instrumental in AFG's decision to stop writing new policies in January 2010. In December 2015, AFG completed the sale of United Teacher Associates Insurance Company and Continental General Insurance Company, the legal entities containing substantially all of its run-off long-term care insurance business, to HC2 Holdings, Inc. ( HC2\u201d) for approximately $13 million in net proceeds. AFG may also receive up to $13 million of additional proceeds from HC2 in the future contingent upon the release of certain statutory-basis liabilities of the legal entities sold by AFG. In connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, AFG agreed to provide up to an aggregate of $35 million of capital support for the insurance companies, on an as-needed basis to maintain specified surplus levels, subject to immediate reimbursement by HC2 through a five-year capital maintenance agreement. With the completion of this sale, AFG has divested substantially all of its long-term care business (96% as measured by net statutory reserves as of November 30, 2015) and will retain only a small block of long-term care insurance (1,700 policies) with approximately $34 million of reserves. AFG will continue to service and accept renewal premiums on its remaining outstanding policies, which are guaranteed renewable.\nMANAGED INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nAccounting standards require AFG to consolidate its investments in collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) entities that it manages and owns an interest in (in the form of debt). See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements. The effect of consolidating these entities is shown in the tables below (in millions).

earnings and a gain on the sale of an apartment property, partially offset by realized losses on securities in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to realized gains on securities in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a fourth quarter loss reported upon closing of the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business. Core net operating earnings increased $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due primarily to higher core underwriting profit in the property and casualty insurance segment, higher earnings in the annuity segment and improved core operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders decreased $100 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business, higher special A&E charges and realized losses on securities in 2015 compared to realized gains on securities in 2014, partially offset by the gain on the sale of Le Pavillon Hotel and an apartment property and higher core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings\nincreased $47 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to higher underwriting profit and higher net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment and improved core operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders decreased $19 million for the full-year of 2014 compared to the same period of 2013 reflecting significantly lower realized gains on securities, partially offset by higher core net operating earnings and lower special A&E charges. Core net operating earnings increased $54 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to higher underwriting profit and higher net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment and lower holding company expenses.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and income and expenses related to the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>P&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off long-term care and life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consol.

are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and commissions and other underwriting expenses to premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect net investment income, other income, other expenses or federal income taxes.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $179 million in GAAP pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $36 million (25%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $21 million (15%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation and Specialty casualty insurance sub-segments. The increase in GAAP earnings also includes a $15 million pretax gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums ceded\n</td> <td>(300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>1,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unearned premiums\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and other underwriting expenses\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting gain\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses, net (*)\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax non-core gain on sale of apartment property\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*) Excludes the $15 million pretax non-core gain on sale of an apartment property.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate - including discontinued lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG's combined ratio has been better than the industry average for 28 of the last 30 years. Management believes that AFG's insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of its specialty niche focus, product line diversification, stringent underwriting discipline and alignment of compensation incentives.\nAFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial.\nTo understand the overall profitability of particular lines, the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered. Certain short-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily property coverages) generally have quick loss payouts, which reduce the time funds are held, thereby limiting investment income earned thereon. In contrast, long-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily liability coverages and workers' compensation) generally have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle, thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received.\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums ( GWP\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were $1.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $1.30 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $53 million (4%).

Overall average renewal rates were up less than 1% in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nProperty and transportation Gross written premiums increased $33 million (7%) in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 reflecting higher gross written premiums in the transportation and agricultural businesses and new gross written premiums from the Singapore branch, which opened for business in June 2015, partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the property and inland marine and ocean marine businesses. Average renewal rates for this group were up approximately 2% in the fourth quarter of 2015, including a 4% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 4 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 reflecting higher cessions of crop insurance premiums.\nSpecialty casualty Gross written premiums increased $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The majority of businesses in this group reported modest growth, particularly the excess and surplus businesses. This growth was partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the general liability business, primarily the result of competitive market conditions, re-underwriting efforts within the Florida homebuilders market and the slowdown within the energy sector. Average renewal rates for this group were down approximately 2% in the fourth quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower pricing in the workers' compensation business. Excluding the workers' compensation business, average renewal rates in this group increased approximately 1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums declined 1 percentage point for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.\nSpecialty financial Gross written premiums increased $19 million (12%) in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to growth in the financial institutions business. Average renewal rates for this group were up approximately 1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums decreased 3 percentage points, reflecting a decline in auto dealer business, which is heavily reinsured.\nOther specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments.\nCombined Ratio\nPerformance measures such as the combined ratio are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) and underwriting expense ratios.

casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $100 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $21 million (27%). The higher underwriting profit in the 2015 fourth quarter reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation and Specialty casualty sub-segments.\nProperty and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was $34 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $12 million (55%). This increase is due primarily to higher accident year profitability in the transportation and agricultural businesses, partially offset by adverse prior year reserve development at National Interstate, as well as lower profitability in the property and inland marine and ocean marine businesses.\nSpecialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $14 million (39%). This increase is due primarily to higher profitability in the workers' compensation, targeted markets, executive liability and excess and surplus businesses, partially offset by underwriting losses at Marketform.\nSpecialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $3 million (17%). Catastrophe losses were $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to negligible catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOther specialty Underwriting profit for this group was $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $2 million (67%).

property and casualty insurance operations was 61.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 62.8% for the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 1.4%.\nProperty and transportation The 2.1 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses is due primarily to higher profitability in the agricultural businesses and lower commercial auto claims in the transportation businesses, partially offset by higher current year losses in the ocean marine business.\nSpecialty casualty The loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses was comparable in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014.\nSpecialty financial The 4.8 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects an improvement in the loss and LAE ratio of the financial institutions, fidelity, equipment leasing and surety businesses.\nNet prior year reserve development\nAFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to net adverse reserve development related to prior accident years of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an improvement of $15 million.\nProperty and transportation Net adverse reserve development of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects higher than expected claim severity in commercial auto liability insurance at National Interstate and higher than expected claim frequency in the ocean marine business, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business. Net adverse reserve development of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects higher than expected claim frequency in the ocean marine business and higher than anticipated claim severity in the trucking operations, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business.\nSpecialty casualty Net favorable reserve development of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in workers' compensation business, excess liability insurance and directors and officers liability insurance, partially offset by adverse reserve development at Marketform. Net adverse reserve development of $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects adverse reserve development at Marketform and higher than expected claim severity in contractor claims and in a run-off book of casualty business, partially offset by lower than anticipated claim severity in specialty workers' compensation business.\nSpecialty financial Net favorable reserve development of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity business, lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the surety business and lower than expected claim severity on a run-off block of collateral value insurance, partially offset by higher than expected claim severity in products for financial institutions and in the trade credit business. Net favorable reserve development of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects lower than expected claim severity in the surety and fidelity businesses.\nOther specialty In addition to the development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net favorable reserve development of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting amortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive insurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of businesses in 1998 and 2001 and reserve development associated with AFG's internal reinsurance program.\nCatastrophe losses\nAFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. Based on data available at December 31, 2015, AFG's exposure to a catastrophic earthquake or windstorm that industry models indicate could occur once in every 500 years (a 500-year event\u201d) is expected to be less than 3.5% of AFG's shareholders' equity. The $5 million of catastrophe losses in the Specialty financial group in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted primarily from flooding in the midwestern United States.\nCommissions and Other Underwriting Expenses\nAFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses ( U/W Exp\u201d) were $327 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $303 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $24 million (8%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio, calculated as commissions and other underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned, was 29.2% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 28.6% for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 0.6 percentage points.

In recent years, yields available in the financial markets on fixed maturity securities have generally declined, placing downward pressure on AFG's investment portfolio yield.

The property and casualty segment's overall yield on investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 3.25% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 3.54% for the fourth quarter of 2014, a decline of 0.29 percentage points, reflecting lower income from equity in the earnings of limited partnerships and from other investments.\nProperty and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net\nGAAP other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was net income of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a net expense of $11 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an improvement of $16 million (145%). Core other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was a net expense of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $1 million (9%).

While AFG's average annuity investments (at amortized cost) were 13% higher for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, the benefit of this growth was partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields. In addition, strong stock market performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 had a positive impact on the fair value accounting for fixed-indexed annuities ( FIAs\u201d). Conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the favorable impact of the increase in the stock market was more than offset by a decrease in longer-term interest rates and resulted in a negative impact on the fair value accounting for FIAs. AFG's periodic detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations resulted in a net annuity expense reduction of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe following table details AFG's earnings before income taxes from its annuity operations for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits (*)\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetail of annuity earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes -

Performance measures such as net interest spread and net spread earned are often presented by annuity businesses to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance.\nNet Spread on Fixed Annuities (excludes variable annuity earnings)\nThe table below (dollars in millions) details the components of these spreads for AFG's fixed annuity operations (including fixed-indexed annuities):\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>26,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (except as noted):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (as % of fixed annuity investments)\n</td> <td>4.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited - fixed\n</td> <td>(2.12\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.21\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest spread\n</td> <td>2.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefit expenses, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(0.31\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.20\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>(0.75\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.65\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>(0.32\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.28\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.31\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's net spread earned on fixed annuities:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities - before impact of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>1.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (*)\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.14\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities offset by an estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnuity Net Investment Income\nNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $309 million compared to $285 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $24 million (8%). This increase reflects the growth in AFG's annuity business, partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's annuity operations, calculated as net investment income divided by average investment balances (at amortized cost), declined by 0.20 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This decline in net investment yield reflects (i) lower income from other investments, (ii) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (iii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets.\nAnnuity Interest Credited - Fixed\nInterest credited - fixed for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $138 million compared to $127 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $11 million (9%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The\naverage interest rate credited to policyholders, calculated as interest credited divided by average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, decreased 0.09 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, interest rates credited on new premiums generally ranged from 1.00% to 2.80%.\nAnnuity Net Interest Spread\nAFG's net interest spread decreased 0.11 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the impact of lower investment yields. In addition, features included in current annuity product offerings allow AFG to achieve its desired profitability at a lower net interest spread than historical product offerings. As a result of these two items, AFG expects its net interest spread to narrow in the future.\nAnnuity Policy Charges and Other Miscellaneous Income\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income, which consist primarily of surrender charges and the amortization of deferred upfront policy charges (unearned revenue), were $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $13 million (54%). Excluding the impact of an unlocking charge of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and unlocking income of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income were $13 million in 2015 compared to $14 million in 2014, a decrease of $1 million (7%).\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income.\nOther Annuity Benefits\nOther annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees (excluding the impact of unlocking) for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $19 million compared to $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $6 million (46%). In addition to interest credited to policyholders' accounts and the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, annuity benefits expense also includes the following expenses (in millions, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees): Table 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in expected death and annuitization reserve\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of sales inducements\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other benefit reserves\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offset guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve related to FIAs is inversely impacted by the calculated FIA embedded derivative reserve as the value to policyholders of the guaranteed withdrawal benefits increases when the benefit of stock market participation decreases.\nAnnuity Acquisition Expenses\nExcluding the impact of unlocking charges (expense reductions), AFG's amortization of DPAC and commission expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated was 0.75% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 0.65% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and has generally ranged between 0.70% and 0.80%. Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG's fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the negative impact of lower interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2014 on the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting deceleration in the amortization of DPAC. During the third quarter of 2015, the deceleration in the amortization of DPAC caused by the negative impact of poor stock market performance on the fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities was limited on certain recently issued products. This prior period limitation had a $5 million favorable impact on the amortization of DPAC related to the fair value accounting for those derivatives when the stock market rebounded during the fourth quarter of 2015. This favorable impact is reported in the impact on DPAC of derivatives related to FIAs.\nAnnuity Other Expenses\nAnnuity other expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $22 million compared to $17 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $5 million (29%). The fourth quarter of 2014 includes the favorable impact of settling certain accrued expenses\nat a lower cost than previously estimated. Annuity other expenses represent primarily general and administrative expenses, as well as selling and issuance expenses that are not deferred. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses increased 0.04 percentage points for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In general, this percentage is expected to decrease as AFG's annuity business grows and annuity other expenses remain relatively stable.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG's fixed-indexed annuities, which represented approximately 60% of annuity benefits accumulated at December 31, 2015, provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG's strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be marked-to-market through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG's annuity benefits accumulated, see Note D - Fair Value Measurements\u201d to the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities had a nominal impact on annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased annuity benefits by $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $18 million impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects the negative impact of lower interest rates on the derivatives, partially offset by the favorable impact of strong stock market performance.\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products. The table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes - before change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs illustrated in the table above, the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, including the related impact on amortization of DPAC increased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and decreased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to future write-offs of DPAC or the present value of future profits on business in force of companies acquired ( PVFP\u201d).\nAnnuity Net Spread Earned on Fixed Annuities\nAFG's net spread earned on fixed annuities decreased 0.01 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the 0.11 percentage points decrease in AFG's net interest spread and the impact of growth in AFG's annuity business on other expenses and other annuity benefits as a percent of fixed annuity benefits accumulated discussed above, partially offset by the net impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives and related DPAC amortization offset discussed above.\nAnnuity Benefits Accumulated\nAnnuity premiums received and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in annuity benefits accumulated rather than as revenue and expense. Increases in this liability for interest credited and other benefits are charged to expense and decreases for surrender and other policy charges are credited to other income.\nFor certain products, annuity benefits accumulated also includes reserves for accrued persistency and premium bonuses, excess benefits expected to be paid on future deaths and annuitizations ( EDAR\u201d) and guaranteed withdrawal benefits.

As a result of these reviews, AFG recorded net expense reductions related to its annuity business of $10 million in 2015 and $1 million in 2014, which impacted AFG's financial statements as follows (in millions):\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unearned revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-indexed annuity embedded derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales inducements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annuity benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expense reduction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2015 net expense reduction was due primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions to reflect higher than previously projected net interest spreads as well as the impact of higher assets under management and expense discipline. Reinvestment rates used to project future investment yields are based primarily on 7-year and 10-year corporate bond yields. For the 2015 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 3.87% in 2016, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.53% in 2022 and beyond.\nThe 2014 net expense reduction was due primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions to reflect a decrease in future expected call option costs related to the fixed-indexed annuity business and lower lapses, partially offset by lower future investment yield assumptions. For the 2014 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 3.57% in 2015, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.54% in 2022 and beyond.\nAnnuity Earnings before Income Taxes Reconciliation\nThe following table reconciles the net spread earned on AFG's fixed annuities to overall annuity pretax earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on investments in excess of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (*)\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable annuity earnings\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>Net investment income (as a % of investments) of 4.65% and 4.85% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, multiplied by the difference between average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost) and average fixed annuity benefits accumulated in each period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life Segment - Results of Operations AFG's run-off long-term care and life segment incurred GAAP pretax losses of $4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015, which includes a $4 million pretax non-core realized loss adjustment to the previously recognized $162 million estimated pretax loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.

Net Investment Income\nAFG recorded net investment income on investments held outside of its insurance operations of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nHolding Company and Other - P&C Fees and Related Expenses\nSummit, the workers' compensation insurance business that AFG acquired in April 2014, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG's property and casualty businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In the fourth quarter of 2015, AFG collected $16 million in fees for these services. Management views this fee income, net of the $10 million in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG's segmented results. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, these fees are shown in other income and the related expenses are shown in other expenses in AFG's Statement of Earnings.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Income\nOther income in the table above includes $4 million and $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively, in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG's consolidated managed investment entities). The $7 million in management fees in the fourth quarter of 2014 includes a $4 million incentive management fee earned in connection with the liquidation of a CLO. The management fees are eliminated in consolidation - see the other income line in the Consolidate MIEs column under Results of Operations - Segmented Statement of Earnings.\u201d Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its insurance operations of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

$456 million in 2014, an increase of $120 million (26%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $577 million in 2015 compared to $480 million in 2014, an increase of $97 million (20%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG's property and casualty insurance sub-segments, higher net investment income (due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the Summit acquisition on April 1, 2014) and lower net expenses. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 also reflects pretax non-core gains of $51 million on the sale of Le Pavillon Hotel and $15 million on the sale of an apartment property, partially offset by higher non-core special A&E charges in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $456 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2014 compared to $375 million in 2013, an increase of $81 million (22%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $480 million in 2014 compared to $429 million in 2013, an increase of $51 million (12%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty group and Property and transportation group and higher net investment income (due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the April 2014 Summit acquisition), partially offset by higher other net expenses. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings also reflects lower non-core special A&E charges in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 -

Overall average renewal rates increased approximately 1% in 2015.\nThe $672 million (14%) increase in gross written premiums in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects $414 million in premiums from Summit (acquired in April 2014) as well as significant growth in other businesses within the Specialty casualty group. Excluding premiums from Summit, gross written premiums increased by 5% in 2014 compared to 2013. Overall average renewal rates increased approximately 3% in 2014.\nProperty and transportation Gross written premiums increased $113 million (5%) in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase is the result of higher gross written premiums in the transportation businesses due primarily to new accounts, higher gross written premiums in the agricultural businesses and new gross written premiums from the Singapore branch, which opened for business in June 2015, partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the property and inland marine businesses. Average renewal rates were up approximately 4% for this group in 2015, including a 5% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums were comparable in 2015 and 2014.\nGross written premiums decreased $50 million (2%) in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting the impact of lower 2014 commodity prices on the crop operations, partially offset by growth in the transportation businesses resulting from rate increases. Excluding the crop insurance business, gross written premiums increased by 6% for this group in 2014 compared to 2013. Average renewal rates were up approximately 5% for this group in 2014, including a 7% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums declined 2 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 as lower cessions in the crop business were partially offset by higher cessions in the excess property business and certain captive programs in the transportation business and the impact of a change in the mix of business.\nSpecialty casualty Gross written premiums increased $210 million (8%) in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting $535 million in gross written premiums from Summit (acquired in April 2014) in 2015 compared to $414 million in 2014. Excluding premiums from Summit, gross written premiums increased 4% in 2015 compared to 2014. While most of the businesses in this group reported growth, the workers' compensation, excess and surplus lines and targeted markets businesses were primary drivers of the higher premiums, partially offset by lower premiums in the general liability business, primarily the result of competitive market conditions, re-underwriting efforts within the Florida homebuilders market and the slowdown within the energy sector. Average renewal rates for this group were down 1% in 2015 due primarily to lower pricing in the workers' compensation businesses. Excluding the workers' compensation business, average renewal rates in this group increased 1% during 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums declined 1 percentage point in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Summit, which cedes only about 1% of its premiums.\nGross written premiums increased $739 million (41%) in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting $414 million in premiums from Summit, which was acquired in April 2014. Excluding premiums from Summit, gross written premiums increased 18% in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of increased premiums in nearly all businesses in this group, particularly in the workers' compensation, excess and surplus lines and targeted markets operations. New business opportunities and increased exposures from higher payroll on existing accounts contributed to the increase in premiums in the workers' compensation businesses. Strong premium growth in the excess and surplus lines and targeted markets operations was the result of broadening opportunities to write business coupled with the benefit from rate increases over multiple quarters. Average renewal rates were up approximately 2% for this group in 2014. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums declined 6 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Summit, which cedes only about 1% of its premiums.\nSpecialty financial Gross written premiums increased $32 million (5%) in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to higher gross written premiums in the surety, financial institutions and equipment leasing businesses. Average renewal rates for this group were flat in 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums decreased 4 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting a decline in auto dealer business, which is heavily reinsured.\nGross written premiums decreased $17 million (3%) in 2014 compared to 2013. The impact of the October 2013 sale of a service contract business, which ceded all of its premiums under reinsurance contracts, more than offset growth in gross written premiums across most businesses in this group. Average renewal rates for this group decreased about 1% in 2014. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums declined 3 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting the sale of the service contract business, partially offset by higher cessions in the financial institutions business.\nOther specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty sub-segments.\nCombined Ratio\nThe table below details the components of the combined ratio for AFG's property and casualty segment for 2015, 2014 and

increase of $58 million (24%). The higher underwriting profit in 2015 reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG's property and casualty insurance sub-segments. Overall catastrophe losses were $35 million (0.8 points on the combined ratio) in 2015 compared to $28 million (0.7 points on the combined ratio) in 2014.\nThe Specialty property and casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $237 million in 2014 compared to $206 million in 2013, an increase of $31 million (15%). The higher underwriting profit in 2014 reflects significantly higher underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty and Property and transportation groups. Overall catastrophe losses were $28 million (0.7 points on the combined ratio) in 2014 compared to $31 million (1.0 points), in 2013.\nProperty and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was $48 million in 2015 compared to $21 million in 2014, an increase of $27 million (129%). Higher profits in the agricultural operations and improved year-over-year underwriting results at National Interstate, due primarily to lower adverse prior year reserve development, were partially offset by lower profitability in the property and inland marine, ocean marine and other transportation businesses.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $21 million in 2014 compared to $12 million in 2013, an increase of $9 million (75%). Higher underwriting profit in the property and inland marine operations, including lower catastrophe losses, was partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the agricultural operations. Catastrophe losses were $20 million (1.3 points) for this group in 2014 compared to $27 million (1.8 points) in 2013.\nSpecialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was $146 million in 2015 compared to $136 million in 2014, an increase of $10 million (7%). This increase is due primarily to higher profitability in the workers' compensation and targeted markets businesses, partially offset by higher adverse prior year reserve development at Marketform and in the general liability and excess and surplus businesses and lower favorable prior year reserve development in the executive liability business.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $136 million in 2014 compared to $102 million in 2013, an increase of $34 million (33%). Higher underwriting profit in the workers' compensation businesses, including the impact of the Summit business acquired in April 2014, was partially offset by lower underwriting results in the general liability lines of business, adverse prior year reserve development in the international operations and lower favorable prior year reserve development in the executive liability business.\nSpecialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was $87 million in 2015 compared to $64 million in 2014, an increase of $23 million (36%). This increase was driven by higher favorable prior year reserve development across the group and higher current year underwriting profitability in the fidelity and financial institutions businesses, partially offset by an increase of $6 million in catastrophe losses in 2015 compared to 2014.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $64 million in 2014 compared to $67 million in 2013, a decrease of $3 million (4%). Lower profitability in the trade credit and financial institutions businesses was partially offset by higher profitability in the surety business.\nOther specialty Underwriting profit for this group was $14 million in 2015 compared to $16 million in 2014, a decrease of $2 million (13%).\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $16 million in 2014 compared to $25 million in 2013, a decrease of $9 million (36%). The decrease is due primarily to lower favorable prior year loss development in the business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty sub-segments.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nAFG's overall loss and LAE ratio was 63.8%, 64.3% and 63.7% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

acquisition in April 2014, which has a higher loss and LAE ratio than AFG's overall Specialty casualty group, partially offset by higher profitability in the California workers' compensation business.\nSpecialty financial The 3.2 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects an improvement in the loss and LAE ratio of the financial institutions, fidelity and equipment leasing businesses.\nThe 1.0% percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the 2014 current year, excluding catastrophe losses compared to 2013 reflects an increase in the loss and LAE ratio of the financial institutions business.\nNet prior year reserve development\nAFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of $37 million in 2015 compared to $19 million in 2014 and $75 million in 2012, an increase of $18 million and a decrease of $56 million, respectively.\nProperty and transportation Net adverse reserve development of $15 million in 2015 reflects higher than expected claim severity at National Interstate and higher than anticipated claim frequency in the ocean marine business, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business, agricultural operations and a run-off book of homebuilders business.\nNet adverse reserve development of $16 million in 2014 reflects higher than expected severity in commercial auto liability losses written in the transportation businesses, partially offset by lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the property and inland marine business and lower than expected claim frequency in the agricultural operations.\nNet favorable reserve development of $1 million in 2013 reflects lower than expected claims handling expense in the crop business and lower claim severity in the property and inland marine and ocean marine businesses, substantially offset by adverse development from higher than expected claim severity in commercial auto liability business written in the transportation businesses.\nSpecialty casualty Net favorable reserve development of $11 million in 2015 includes lower than anticipated claim severity in workers' compensation business, lower than anticipated claim severity and frequency in excess liability insurance and lower than expected claim severity in directors and officers liability insurance, partially offset by adverse reserve development at Marketform.\nNet favorable reserve development of $7 million in 2014 reflects lower than expected claim severity in directors and officers liability insurance, lower than expected claim severity and frequency in excess liability insurance and lower than anticipated claim severity in specialty workers' compensation business, partially offset by higher than expected severity in contractor claims and in a run-off book of casualty business and adverse reserve development at Marketform.\nNet favorable reserve development of $40 million in 2013 reflects lower than expected claim severity in directors and officers liability insurance and lower than expected claim severity and frequency in excess liability business, partially offset by adverse development from higher than expected claim frequency and severity in products liability claims and higher than expected claim severity in contractor claims.\nSpecialty financial Net favorable reserve development of $30 million in 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity in the surety business and products for financial institutions and lower than expected claim severity in the fidelity business and run-off collateral value insurance.\nNet favorable reserve development of $17 million in 2014 reflects lower than expected claim severity in the surety and fidelity businesses and lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the trade credit business and products for financial institutions.\nNet favorable reserve development of $14 million in 2013 is due to lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the trade credit and financial institutions businesses as economic conditions did not affect these lines as adversely as had been anticipated.\nOther specialty In addition to the development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net favorable reserve development of $11 million in both 2015 and 2014 and $20 million in 2013, reflecting amortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive insurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of businesses in 1998 and 2001 and reserve development associated with AFG's internal reinsurance program.\nAsbestos and Environmental Reserve Charges As previously discussed under Uncertainties\u201d - Asbestos and Environmental-related ( A&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves,\u201d AFG has established property and casualty reserves for claims related to environmental exposures and asbestos claims. Total charges recorded to increase reserves (net of reinsurance recoverable) for A&E exposures of AFG's property and casualty group (included in loss and loss adjustment expenses) were $67 million in 2015, $24 million in 2014 and $59 million in 2013.\nAggregate Aggregate net prior accident years reserve development for AFG's property and casualty segment includes the A&E charges mentioned above and adverse reserve development of $3 million in 2015, $1 million in 2014 and $1 million in 2013 related to run-off assumed insurance business.\nCatastrophe losses\nAFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. The $21 million of catastrophe losses in the Property and transportation group in 2015 resulted primarily from winter storms in the first quarter and multiple storms in the midwestern and central United States in the second and third quarters. The $9 million of catastrophe losses in the Specialty financial group in 2015 resulted primarily from flooding in the midwestern United States. The $20 million of catastrophe losses in the Property and transportation group in 2014 were primarily from winter storms in the month of January and multiple storms in the midwestern and central United States in the second quarter. The $27 million of catastrophe losses in the Property and transportation group in 2013 resulted primarily from spring storms in the southeastern United States.\nCommissions and Other Underwriting Expenses\nAFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses ( U/W Exp\u201d) were $1.30 billion in 2015 compared to $1.17 billion in 2014, an increase of $132 million (11%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio was 30.9% in 2015 compared to 30.2% in 2014, an increase of 0.7 percentage points.\nAFG's property and casualty U/W Exp were $1.17 billion in 2014 compared to $1.02 billion in 2013, an increase of $153 million (15%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio was 30.2% in 2014 compared to 31.8% in 2013, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points.\nDetail of AFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses and underwriting expense ratios is shown below (dollars in millions):\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in % of NEP\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 - 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U/W Exp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of NEP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U/W Exp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of NEP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U/W Exp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of NEP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and transportation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty casualty\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty financial\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other specialty\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $132 million increase in commissions and other underwriting expenses reflects the acquisition of Summit in April 2014. The overall increase of 0.7% in AFG's expense ratio in 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects higher profitability-based commissions paid to agents and brokers, partially offset by the impact of higher premiums on the ratio.\nThe $153 million increase in commissions and other underwriting expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects the acquisition of Summit in April 2014. The overall decrease of 1.6% in commissions and other underwriting expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects the acquisition of Summit, which has a lower expense ratio than AFG's overall property and casualty operations.\nProperty and transportation Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.7 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting higher profitability-based commissions paid to agents and brokers, partially offset by the impact of higher premiums on the ratio.\nCommissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 0.3 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting lower profitability-based commissions paid to agents and brokers, an increase in ceding commissions received from reinsurers and a change in the mix of business.\nSpecialty casualty Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.2 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to a charge of $6 million in the second quarter of 2015 to write off certain previously capitalized project costs, partially offset by the impact of higher premiums on the ratio.\nCommissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 3.8 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to the inclusion of Summit following its acquisition in April 2014, which has a lower expense ratio than AFG's overall Specialty casualty group, and the impact of higher premiums across the Specialty casualty group on the ratio.\nSpecialty financial Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.8 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting higher profitability-based commissions paid to agents and brokers, partially offset by the impact of higher premiums on the ratio.\nCommissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.5 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to the impact of $5 million in reinsurance reinstatement premiums paid in 2014 on the ratio.\nProperty and Casualty Net Investment Income\nNet investment income in AFG's property and casualty operations was $319 million in 2015 compared to $294 million in 2014, an increase of $25 million (9%). Net investment income in AFG's property and casualty operations was $294 million in 2014 compared to $263 million in 2013, an increase of $31 million (12%). Net investment income in AFG's property and casualty operations includes $11 million in 2015 and $8 million in 2014, from recording equity in the earnings of limited partnerships and similar investments. Equity in the earnings of these investments had not been material and was included in realized gains (losses) on securities prior to 2014. In recent years, yields available in the financial markets on fixed maturity securities have generally declined, placing downward pressure on AFG's investment portfolio yield.

The property and casualty segment's overall yield on investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 3.56% in 2015 compared to 3.75% in 2014, a decline of 0.19 percentage points reflecting the impact of lower yields available in the financial markets and lower earnings from other investments.\nThe increase in average invested assets and net investment income in the property and casualty segment in 2014 compared to 2013 is due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the Summit acquisition in April 2014 and organic growth in the property and casualty segment. The property and casualty segment's overall yield on investments was 3.75% in 2014 compared to 3.83% in 2013, a decline of 0.08 percentage points. The impact of equity in the earnings of limited partnerships and similar investments and strong investment results in the first nine months of 2014 was more than offset by the impact of lower yields available in the financial markets.\nProperty and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net\nGAAP other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was net income of $32 million in 2015 and a net expense of $50 million and $33 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Amortization of intangibles includes $7 million in 2015 and $5 million in 2014 related to the Summit acquisition.\nAFG and its consolidated subsidiaries incurred $3 million in transaction expenses related to the February 2014 tender offer by Great American Insurance Company ( GAI\u201d) to acquire all of the National Interstate Corporation common stock that GAI did not already own. These expenses consisted primarily of financial advisory and legal services. The tender offer was terminated in March 2014.\nInterest expense for AFG's property and casualty operations includes interest charges on long-term debt within the property and casualty operations, primarily notes secured by real estate.\nAnnuity Segment - Results of Operations\nAFG's annuity operations contributed $331 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 compared to $328 million in 2014, an increase of $3 million (1%). While AFG's average annuity investments (at amortized cost) were 12% higher in 2015 as compared to 2014, the benefit of this growth and the impact that fluctuations in interest rates had on the fair value accounting for fixed-indexed annuities ( FIAs\u201d) was offset by the negative impact that the stock market decrease had on certain annuity reserves in 2015 compared to a stock market increase in 2014, the run-off of higher yielding investments and higher general and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to 2014. AFG's periodic detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations resulted in a net annuity expense reduction of $10 million in 2015 compared to $1 million in 2014.\nAFG's annuity operations contributed $328 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2014 compared to $323 million in 2013, an increase of $5 million (2%). AFG's annuity operations contributed $328 million in core pretax earnings in both 2014 and 2013. While AFG's average annuity investments (at amortized cost) were 17% higher in 2014 as compared to 2013, the benefit of this growth was offset by the run-off of higher yielding investments, and the impact that fluctuations in interest rates in 2014 and 2013 had on the fair value accounting for FIAs. Operating earnings also include a net unlocking expense reduction of $1 million in 2014 compared to a $2 million charge in 2013.\nIn the second quarter of 2013, AFG recorded a pretax charge of $5 million in its annuity operations to cover expected assessments from state guaranty funds related to the insolvency and liquidation of Executive Life Insurance Company of New York ( ELNY\u201d), an unaffiliated life insurance company. ELNY was placed into rehabilitation by the New York Insurance Department in 1991. In April 2012, ELNY was declared insolvent and ordered into liquidation. AFG's life insurance\nsubsidiaries are required under the solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business to pay assessments up to certain prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies such as ELNY and started receiving guaranty fund assessments related to ELNY from various states in the second quarter of 2013. AFG believes that all ELNY related guaranty fund assessments have been settled.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its annuity operations for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 -

This increase reflects primarily the growth in AFG's annuity business, partially offset by the run-off of higher yielding investments. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's annuity operations, calculated as net investment income divided by average investment balances (at amortized cost), declined by 0.20 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014. This decline in net investment yield reflects (i) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (ii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets.\nNet investment income in 2014 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.03 billion in 2013, an increase of $102 million (10%). This increase primarily reflects the growth in AFG's annuity business, partially offset by the run-off of higher yielding investments. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's annuity operations declined by 0.32 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013. This decline in net investment yield reflects the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the\nexisting investment portfolio and the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets.\nAnnuity Interest Credited - Fixed\nInterest credited - fixed in 2015 was $532 million compared to $497 million in 2014, an increase of $35 million (7%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The average interest rate credited to policyholders, calculated as interest credited divided by average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, decreased 0.11 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014. During 2015, interest rates credited on new premiums generally ranged from 1.00% to 2.80%.\nInterest credited - fixed in 2014 was $497 million compared to $451 million in 2013, an increase of $46 million (10%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The average interest rate credited to policyholders, calculated as interest credited divided by average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, decreased 0.16 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013. During 2014, interest rates credited on new premiums generally ranged from 1.00% to 2.00%.\nAnnuity Net Interest Spread\nAFG's net interest spread decreased 0.09 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to the run-off of higher yielding investments, partially offset by lower crediting rates. In addition, features included in current annuity product offerings allow AFG to achieve its desired profitability at a lower net interest spread than historical product offerings.\nAFG's net interest spread decreased 0.16 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to the run-off of higher yielding investments, partially offset by lower crediting rates.\nAnnuity Policy Charges and Other Miscellaneous Income\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income, which consist primarily of surrender charges and the amortization of deferred upfront policy charges (unearned revenue), were $55 million in 2015 compared to $63 million in 2014, a decrease of $8 million (13%). Excluding the impact of unlocking charges of $2 million in 2015 and unlocking income of $10 million in 2014 related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income were $57 million in 2015 and $53 million in 2014, an increase of $4 million (8%). This increase reflects the impact of $6 million in income from the sale of real estate recorded in 2015.\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income were $63 million in 2014 compared to $52 million in 2013, an increase of $11 million (21%). Excluding the impact of unlocking income of $10 million in 2014 related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income were $53 million in 2014 and $52 million in 2013, an increase of $1 million (2%). This increase reflects growth in the business, partially offset by the impact of $4 million in income from the sale of real estate recorded in 2013.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income.\nOther Annuity Benefits\nOther annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees (excluding the impact of unlocking) were $87 million in 2015, $63 million in 2014 and $69 million in 2013, representing an increase of $24 million (38%) in 2015 compared to 2014 and a decrease of $6 million (9%) in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition to interest credited to policyholders' accounts and the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, annuity benefits expense also includes the following expenses (in millions, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees): Table 234: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in expected death and annuitization reserve\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of sales inducements\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other benefit reserves\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offset guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $24 million increase in other annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects higher expenses related to products with guaranteed withdrawal benefit features. The guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve related to FIAs is inversely impacted by the calculated FIA embedded derivative reserve as the value to policyholders of the guaranteed withdrawal benefits increases when the benefit of stock market participation decreases.\nThe $6 million decrease in other annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects increased fees from products with guaranteed withdrawal benefit features.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity benefits expense.\nAnnuity Acquisition Expenses\nExcluding the impact of unlocking charges (expense reductions), AFG's amortization of DPAC and commission expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated was 0.74% in 2015 compared to 0.67% in 2014 and 0.85% in 2013 and has generally ranged between 0.70% and 0.80%. Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG's fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the negative impact of the stock market decrease in 2015 and lower than anticipated interest rates during 2015 and 2014 on the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting deceleration in the amortization of DPAC; conversely, higher interest rates in 2013 had a positive impact on the fair value of the derivatives, resulting in a partially offsetting acceleration in the amortization of DPAC.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to write-offs of DPAC or PVFP in the future.\nAnnuity Other Expenses\nExcluding the non-core ELNY guaranty fund assessments charge in 2013, annuity other expenses were $96 million in 2015, $82 million in 2014 and $93 million in 2013, representing an increase of $14 million (17%) in 2015 compared to 2014 and a decrease of $11 million (12%) in 2014 compared to 2013. Annuity other expenses represent primarily general and administrative expenses, as well as selling and issuance expenses that are not deferred. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses increased 0.02 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to higher expenses related to professional services and employee compensation plans. Annuity other expenses for 2014 includes the favorable impact of settling certain accrued expenses at a lower cost than previously estimated, while annuity other expenses for 2013 includes a $7 million charge to write off certain previously capitalized project costs. In general this percentage is expected to decrease as AFG's annuity business grows and annuity other expenses remain relatively stable.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG's fixed-indexed annuities, which represented approximately 60% of annuity benefits accumulated at December 31, 2015, provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG's strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be marked-to-market through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG's annuity benefits accumulated, see Note D - Fair Value Measurements\u201d to the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities increased annuity benefits by $45 million in 2015 and $59 million in 2014, reflecting the negative impact of the decline in the stock market in 2015 and lower than anticipated interest rates in 2015 and 2014 on these derivatives. Conversely, the net change in fair value of the derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities reduced annuity benefits by $26 million in 2013 due to the positive impact of higher market interest rates and the net impact of strong market performance on these derivatives.\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products. The table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 - 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core earnings before income taxes - before change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>(45\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(327\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(327\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax non-core ELNY guaranty fund assessments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs illustrated in the table above, the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, net of the related impact on amortization of DPAC decreased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $23 million and $34 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and increased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $15 million in 2013.\nAnnuity Net Spread Earned on Fixed Annuities\nAFG's net spread earned on fixed annuities decreased 0.15 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to the 0.09 percentage points decrease in AFG's net interest spread, the impact of the decline in the stock market on guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserves, and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by income from the sale of real estate recorded primarily in the first quarter of 2015.\nAFG's net spread earned on fixed annuities decreased 0.19 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to the 0.16 percentage points decrease in AFG's net interest spread and the net impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives and related DPAC amortization offset discussed above. These items were partially offset by the impact of growth in AFG's annuity business on other expenses and other annuity benefits as a percent of fixed annuity benefits accumulated discussed above.\nAnnuity Benefits Accumulated\nAnnuity premiums received and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in annuity benefits accumulated rather than as revenue and expense. Increases in this liability for interest credited and other benefits are charged to expense and decreases for surrender and other policy charges are credited to other income.\nFor certain products, annuity benefits accumulated also includes reserves for accrued persistency and premium bonuses, excess benefits expected to be paid on future deaths and annuitizations ( EDAR\u201d) and guaranteed withdrawal benefits. Annuity benefits accumulated also includes amounts advanced from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.

Partially offsetting this decline, AFG experienced growth in the sales of fixed-indexed annuities in the financial institutions market during the first six months of 2014 resulting from new products, expanded distribution and improved market penetration within existing distribution channels.\nAnnuity Unlocking\nIn 2015, 2014 and 2013, AFG conducted its detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations.

Net Investment Income\nAFG recorded net investment income on investments held outside of its insurance operations of $4 million, $5 million and $8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nHolding Company and Other - P&C Fees and Related Expenses\nSummit, the workers' compensation insurance business that AFG acquired in April 2014, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG's property and casualty businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In 2015, AFG collected $54 million in fees for these services. Management views this fee income, net of the $38 million in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG's segmented results. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, these fees are shown in other income and the related expenses are shown in other expenses in AFG's Statement of Earnings.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Income\nOther income in the table above includes $15 million, $25 million and $16 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively of management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG's consolidated managed investment entities). The $25 million of management fees in 2014 includes $13 million of incentive management fees earned in connection with the liquidation of three CLOs. The management fees are eliminated in consolidation - see the other income line in the Consolidated MIEs column under Results of Operations - Segmented Statement of Earnings.\u201d Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its insurance operations of $9 million in 2015 and $11 million in both 2014 and 2013.\nHolding Company and Other - Interest Charges on Borrowed Money\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of $72 million in 2015 compared to $69 million in 2014, an increase of $3 million (4%). This increase reflects the September 2014 issuance of $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures due 2054 and the November 2015 issuance of $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures due 2055, partially offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swap entered into in June 2015 and the September 2015 redemption of $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050.\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of $69 million in 2014 compared to $68 million in 2013, an increase of $1 million (1%). AFG issued $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in late September 2014.\nHolding Company and Other - A&E Charges\nAs a result of the comprehensive external studies and internal review of A&E exposures discussed under Uncertainties - Asbestos and Environmental-related ( A&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves,\u201d AFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded non-core special charges of $12 million in 2015, $6 million in 2014 and $22 million in 2013 to increase liabilities related to the A&E exposures of AFG's former railroad and manufacturing operations. These charges related to slightly higher estimated costs at sites where remediation is underway, coupled with higher estimated cleanup costs at a limited number of sites. Total charges recorded to increase liabilities for A&E exposures of AFG's former railroad and manufacturing operations (included in other expenses) were $22 million in 2015, $13 million in 2014 and $29 million in 2013.\nHolding Company and Other - Loss on Early Retirement of Debt\nAFG wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $4 million related to the redemption of its $132 million outstanding 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par value on September 30, 2015.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Expenses\nExcluding the non-core special A&E charges and the non-core loss on early retirement of debt, AFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded other expenses of $116 million, $115 million and $135 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $20 million (15%) decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects the impact of higher holding company expenses in 2013, primarily related to employee benefit plans that are tied to stock market performance and certain share-based incentive plans.\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities AFG's consolidated realized gains (losses) on securities, which are not allocated to segments, were losses of $19 million in 2015 compared to gains of $52 million in 2014, a decrease of $71 million (137%). AFG's consolidated realized gains on securities were $52 million in 2014 compared to $221 million in 2013, a decrease of $169 million (76%).

Approximately $41 million of the charges are on real estate and mortgage related investments, $38 million are on energy related investments and $12 million are on investments in asset managers.\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Subsidiaries In addition to the $166 million pretax realized loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business recorded in 2015, AFG recorded a $5 million pretax\nrealized gain in the third quarter of 2015 representing an adjustment to the previously recognized loss on a small property and casualty subsidiary sold several years ago.\nConsolidated Income Taxes AFG's consolidated provision for income taxes was $195 million in 2015 compared to $220 million in 2014, a decrease of $25 million (11%). AFG's consolidated provision for income taxes was $220 million in 2014 compared to $236 million in 2013, a decrease of $16 million (7%).

Under the new guidance, there are no longer any CLO earnings or losses to be attributed to noncontrolling interests in AFG's Statement of Earnings.\nOther noncontrolling interests includes $6 million related to the gain on the sale of Le Pavillon Hotel in the second quarter of 2015, which was owned by an 80%-owned subsidiary of Great American Insurance Company.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2015 that affects the measurement of the fair value of CLO liabilities.\nSee Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2015 that impacts the determination of when a component of an entity qualifies for presentation as a discontinued operation.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN 2016\nSee Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting guidance that AFG will be required to adopt effective January 1, 2016, which could impact the consolidation of collateralized financing entities such as CLOs, as well as limited partnerships and similar investments.\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2015-03, which will require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction in the carrying value of long-term debt (consistent with the treatment of debt discounts) with the periodic amortization of such costs included in interest expense. AFG currently carries debt issuance costs as a deferred charge ($23 million at December 31, 2015 and included in other assets in AFG's Balance Sheet) with the periodic amortization ($1 million in 2015) included in other expenses in AFG's Statement of Earnings. The updated guidance, which AFG will be required to adopt effective January 1, 2016, does not affect the overall recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. Accordingly, the guidance will have no overall impact on AFG's Shareholders' Equity or results of operations.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09, Financial Services-Insurance: Disclosures About Short-Duration Contracts, which requires additional disclosures about the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (including accident year information). AFG will be required to adopt the updated guidance for annual reporting beginning in 2016 and interim reporting beginning with the first quarter of 2017. Because the new guidance does not affect the existing recognition or measurement guidance, the adoption will have no effect on AFG's financial condition or results of operations.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INDEX TO MD&A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Page\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Page\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Results of Operations - Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>48\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segmented Statement of Earnings\n</td> <td>48\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Critical Accounting Policies\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Property and Casualty Insurance\n</td> <td>49\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>58\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off Long-Term Care and Life\n</td> <td>64\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Holding Company, Other and Unallocated\n</td> <td>64\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parent and Subsidiary Liquidity\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Results of Operations - Full Year\n</td> <td>68\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Condensed Parent Only Cash Flows\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segmented Statement of Earnings\n</td> <td>68\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Property and Casualty Insurance\n</td> <td>70\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>80\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off Long-Term Care and Life\n</td> <td>88\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertainties\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Holding Company, Other and Unallocated\n</td> <td>89\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Investment Entities\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recent and Pending Accounting Standards\n</td> <td>91\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Results of Operations\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGENERAL\nFollowing is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of AFG's financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Condition\nAFG is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries. AFG, however, has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses, the payment of principal and interest on borrowings, shareholder dividends, and taxes. Therefore, certain analyses are most meaningfully presented on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis. In addition, because most of its businesses are financial in nature, AFG does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current-noncurrent format. Consequently, certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful.\nAt December 31, 2015, AFG (parent) held approximately $252 million in cash and securities and had $500 million available under a bank line of credit expiring in December 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThrough the operations of its subsidiaries, AFG is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses and in the sale of fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets.\nFourth quarter 2015 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $129 million ($1.45 per share, diluted) compared to $127 million ($1.41 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting:\n \u2022 higher underwriting profit in the property and casualty insurance segment, \n \u2022 higher net operating earnings in the annuity segment, \n \u2022 improved core net operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment, \n \u2022 the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, \n \u2022 the fourth quarter loss reported upon closing of the sale of the long-term care business, and \n \u2022 realized losses on securities in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to realized gains in the fourth quarter of 2014. \nFull year 2015 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $352 million ($3.94 per share, diluted) compared to $452 million ($4.97 per share) in 2014, reflecting:\n \u2022 higher core underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment, \n \u2022 higher special A&E charges recorded in 2015 compared to 2014, \n \u2022 improved core net operating earnings in the run-off long-term care and life segment, \n \u2022 the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, \n \u2022 the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Le Pavillon Hotel, \n \u2022 the loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care business, and \n \u2022 realized losses on securities in 2015 compared to realized gains in 2014. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSignificant accounting policies are summarized in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions change and, thus, impact amounts reported in the future. The areas where management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements is most significant are as follows:\n \u2022 the establishment of insurance reserves, especially asbestos and environmental-related reserves, \n \u2022 the recoverability of reinsurance, \n \u2022 the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs, \n \u2022 the establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves of former railroad and manufacturing operations, and \n \u2022 the valuation of investments, including the determination of other-than-temporary\u201d impairments. \nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uncertainties\u201d for a discussion of insurance reserves, recoverables from reinsurers, and contingencies related to American Premier's former operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments\u201d for a discussion of impairments on investments. DPAC and certain liabilities related to annuities and universal life insurance products are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies. Assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management's estimates of interest rates and investment spreads, surrenders, annuitizations, renewal premiums and mortality. Should actual experience require management to change its assumptions (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust DPAC or annuity liabilities to the levels they would have been if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRatios AFG's debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below (dollars in millions). Management intends to maintain the ratio of debt to capital at or below 25% and intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at or above levels currently indicated by rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings.

The ratio is calculated by dividing AFG's long-term debt by its total capital, which includes long-term debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders' equity (excluding unrealized gains (losses) related to fixed maturity investments and appropriated retained earnings related to managed investment entities).\nAFG's ratio of earnings to fixed charges, including annuity benefits as a fixed charge, was 1.66 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding annuity benefits, this ratio was 6.58. Although the ratio excluding annuity benefits is not\nrequired or encouraged to be disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company.\nThe NAIC's model law for risk based capital ( RBC\u201d) applies to both life and property and casualty companies. RBC formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs so that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired. At December 31, 2015, the capital ratios of all AFG insurance companies substantially exceeded the RBC requirements.\nCondensed Consolidated Cash Flows AFG's principal sources of cash include insurance premiums, income from its investment portfolio and proceeds from the maturities, redemptions and sales of investments. Insurance premiums in excess of acquisition expenses and operating costs are invested until they are needed to meet policyholder obligations or made available to the parent company through dividends to cover debt obligations and corporate expenses, and to provide returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. AFG's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as detailed in its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are shown below (in millions):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,577\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,619\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>3,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities AFG's property and casualty insurance operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as premiums collected and investment income exceed policy acquisition costs, claims payments and operating expenses. AFG's net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by the level and timing of property and casualty premiums, claim and expense payments and recoveries from reinsurers. AFG's annuity operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as investment income exceeds acquisition costs and operating expenses. Interest credited on annuity policyholder funds is a non-cash increase in AFG's annuity benefits accumulated liability and annuity premiums, benefits and withdrawals are considered financing activities due to the deposit-type nature of annuities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.36 billion, $1.22 billion and $760 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities AFG's investing activities consist primarily of the investment of funds provided by its property and casualty and annuity products. Net cash used in investing activities was $4.58 billion in 2015 compared to $3.62 billion in 2014, an increase of $958 million. The $537 million increase in net cash flows from annuity policyholders in 2015 as compared to 2014 (discussed below under net cash provided by financing activities) increased the amount of cash available for investment in 2015 compared to 2014. In addition to the investment of funds provided by the insurance operations, investing activities also include the purchase and disposal of managed investment entity investments (collateralized loan obligations), which are presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $675 million use of cash in 2015 compared to a $275 million use of cash in 2014, accounting for a $400 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.62 billion in 2014 compared to $2.92 billion in 2013, an increase of $704 million. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $275 million use of cash in 2014 compared to a $478 million source of cash in 2013, accounting for a $753 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities AFG's financing activities consist primarily of transactions with annuity policyholders, issuances and retirements of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.10 billion in 2015 compared to $2.10 billion in 2014, an increase of $996 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $2.50 billion in 2015 compared to $1.97 billion in 2014, resulting in a $537 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities. Redemptions of long-term debt resulted in a $192 million use of cash in 2015. AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in 2015 and $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in 2014, the net proceeds of each issuance contributed $145 million to net cash provided by financing activities in those years. During 2015, AFG repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $126 million compared to 3.3 million shares repurchased in 2014 for $191 million, which accounted for a $65 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. Financing activities also include issuances and\nretirements of managed investment entity liabilities, which are nonrecourse to AFG and presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $890 million in 2015 while issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $306 million in 2014, accounting for a $584 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. See Managed Investment Entities in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2.10 billion in 2014 compared to $2.09 billion in 2013, an increase of $12 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $1.97 billion in 2014 compared to $2.68 billion in 2013, resulting in a $711 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities. During 2014, AFG repurchased 3.3 million shares of its Common Stock for $191 million compared to 1.4 million shares repurchased in 2013 for $70 million, which accounted for a $121 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013. AFG issued $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in 2014, the net proceeds of which contributed $145 million to net cash provided by financing activities. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $306 million in 2014 while retirements of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded issuances by $368 million in 2013, accounting for a $674 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013.\nParent and Subsidiary Liquidity\nParent Holding Company Liquidity Management believes AFG has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements. If funds generated from operations, including dividends, tax payments and borrowings from subsidiaries, are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period, AFG would be required to utilize parent company cash and marketable securities or to generate cash through borrowings, sales of other assets, or similar transactions.\nAFG can borrow up to $500 million under its revolving credit facility which expires in December 2016. Amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 1.00% to 1.875% (currently 1.375%) over LIBOR based on AFG's credit rating. There were no borrowings under this agreement, or under any other parent company short-term borrowing arrangements, during 2015.\nIn November 2015, AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures due 2055. AFG intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchases of outstanding common stock. In September 2015, AFG redeemed its $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par using cash on hand at the parent company.\nDuring 2015, AFG repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $126 million. In December 2015, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million. In January 2016, AFG repurchased 951,394 additional shares of its Common Stock for $64 million.\nIn April 2014, AFG completed the purchase of Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and its related companies ( Summit\u201d) from Liberty Mutual Insurance for $259 million using cash on hand at the parent company. In addition, AFG made a capital contribution of approximately $140 million, bringing its capital investment in the Summit business to $399 million. Summit's results of operations are included in AFG's consolidated results beginning in April of 2014.\nIn September 2014, AFG issued $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures due 2054. During 2014, AFG repurchased 3.3 million shares of its Common Stock for $191 million. In December 2014, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nDuring 2013, AFG repurchased 1.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $70 million. In December 2013, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $89 million.\nAll debentures and notes issued by AFG are rated investment grade by two nationally recognized rating agencies. Under a currently effective shelf registration statement, AFG can offer additional equity or debt securities. The shelf registration provides AFG with flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit.\nUnder a tax allocation agreement with AFG, its 80%-owned U.S. subsidiaries generally pay taxes to (or recover taxes from) AFG based on each subsidiary's contribution to amounts due under AFG's consolidated tax return.\nSubsidiary Liquidity Great American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC\u201d), a wholly-owned annuity subsidiary, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati ( FHLB\u201d). The FHLB makes advances and provides other banking services to\nmember institutions, which provides the annuity operations with a substantial additional source of liquidity. These advances further the FHLB's mission of improving access to housing by increasing liquidity in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. At December 31, 2015, GALIC had $785 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB (included in annuity benefits accumulated), bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.02% to 0.49% over LIBOR (average rate of 0.58% at December 31, 2015). While these advances must be repaid between 2016 and 2020, GALIC has the option to prepay all or a portion of the advances. GALIC has invested the proceeds from the advances in fixed maturity securities for the purpose of earning a spread over the interest payments due to the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, GALIC estimated that it had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $750 million from the FHLB.\nNational Interstate Corporation ( NATL\u201d), a 51%-owned property and casualty insurance subsidiary, can borrow up to $100 million under its unsecured credit agreement, which expires in November 2017. There was $12 million borrowed under this agreement at December 31, 2015, bearing interest at 1.40% (six-month LIBOR plus 0.875%). The maximum outstanding balance in 2015 was $12 million.\nThe liquidity requirements of AFG's insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses, payments of dividends and taxes to AFG and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries. Historically, cash flows from premiums and investment income have generally provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements. Funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities. In addition, the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid, short-term investments.\nThe excess cash flow of AFG's property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves.\nIn the annuity business, where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities, the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities. In a rising interest rate environment, significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on AFG's annuity products. With declining rates, AFG receives some protection (from spread compression) due to the ability to lower crediting rates, subject to contractually guaranteed minimum interest rates ( GMIRs\u201d). AFG began selling policies with GMIRs below 2% in 2003; almost all new business since late 2010 has been issued with a 1% GMIR. At December 31, 2015, AFG could reduce the average crediting rate on approximately $20 billion of traditional fixed and fixed-indexed deferred annuities without guaranteed withdrawal benefits by approximately 72 basis points (on a weighted average basis). Annuity policies are subject to Guaranteed Minimum Interest Rates ( GMIRs\u201d) at policy issuance. The table below shows the breakdown of annuity reserves by GMIR. The current interest crediting rates on substantially all of AFG's annuities with a GMIR of 3% or higher are at their minimum.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>at December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>GMIR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1 - 1.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2 - 2.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>3 - 3.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4.00% and above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Annuity benefits accumulated (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$23,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor statutory accounting purposes, equity securities of non-affiliates and equity call options used in the fixed-indexed annuity business are generally carried at fair value. At December 31, 2015, AFG's insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a fair value of $1.67 billion and equity call options with a fair value of $241 million. In addition, GAI's investment in NATL common stock had a fair value of $272 million and a statutory carrying value of $217 million at December 31, 2015. Decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group's capital, potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution. Conversely, increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group's dividend-paying capability.\nAFG believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses. In addition, these subsidiaries have sufficient capital to meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies, inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies. Nonetheless, changes in statutory accounting rules, significant declines in the fair value of the insurance subsidiaries' investment portfolios or significant ratings downgrades on these investments, could create a need for additional capital.\nCondensed Parent Only Cash Flows AFG's parent holding company only condensed cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are shown below (in millions):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(232\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(231\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nParent Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Parent holding company cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of dividends and tax payments received from AFG's insurance subsidiaries, reduced by tax payments to the IRS and holding company interest and other expenses. Parent holding company net cash provided by operating activities was $162 million in 2015 compared to $372 million in 2014 and $428 million in 2013. Lower dividends from subsidiaries received in 2015 as compared to 2014 and 2014 as compared to 2013 were the primary driver of the $210 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 and the $56 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013.\nParent Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Parent holding company investing activities consist of capital contributions to and returns of capital from subsidiaries and, to a much lesser extent, parent company investment activity. Parent holding company net cash used in investing activities was $33 million in 2015 compared to $432 million in 2014 and $4 million in 2013. The $33 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 and the $4 million in 2013 are significantly lower than the $432 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 due primarily to capital contributions made to a subsidiary to fund the $399 million investment in Summit in 2014.\nParent Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Parent company financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of AFG Common Stock, dividends to shareholders, the issuance and retirement of long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Significant long-term debt and common stock transactions are discussed above under Parent Holding Company Liquidity.\u201d Parent holding company net cash used in financing activities was $232 million in 2015 compared to $171 million in 2014 and $180 million in 2013. The $61 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects the 2015 redemption of $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050, partially offset by a $65 million decrease in common stock repurchases. The $9 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 reflects net proceeds of $145 million received in 2014 from the issuance of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures due in 2054, partially offset by a $121 million increase in common stock repurchases.\nContractual Obligations The following table shows an estimate (based on historical patterns and expected trends) of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities, as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations (in millions).

These assumptions also include interest and index crediting consistent with assumptions used to amortize DPAC and assess loss recognition. All estimated cash payments are undiscounted for the time value of money. As a result, total outflows for all years exceed the corresponding liabilities of $26.62 billion for annuity benefits accumulated and $705 million for life, accident and health reserves included in AFG's Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. Based on the same assumptions, AFG projects reinsurance recoveries related to life, accident and health reserves totaling $851 million as follows: Within 1 year - $86 million; 2-3 years - $146 million; 4-5 years - $121 million; and thereafter - $498 million. Actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates. \n (b) Dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserves and do not represent actual contractual obligations. Based on the same assumptions, AFG projects reinsurance recoveries related to these reserves totaling $2.20 billion as follows: Within 1 year - $500 million; 2-3 years - $500 million; 4-5 years - $200 million; and thereafter - $1.00 billion. Actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates. \nAFG has no material contractual purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements See Note P - Additional Information - Financial Instruments - Unfunded Commitments\u201d to the financial statements.\nInvestments AFG attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio, placing emphasis upon total long-term performance.\nAFG's investment portfolio at December 31, 2015, contained $32.28 billion in fixed maturity securities and $1.55 billion in equity securities classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in a separate component of shareholders' equity on an after-tax basis. In addition, $254 million in fixed maturities and $166 million in equity securities were classified as trading with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses included in net investment income.\nAs detailed in Note E - Investments - Net Unrealized Gain on Marketable Securities\u201d to the financial statements, unrealized gains and losses on AFG's fixed maturity and equity securities are included in shareholders' equity after adjustments for related changes in DPAC and certain liabilities related to annuity, long-term care and life businesses, noncontrolling interests and deferred income taxes. DPAC and certain other balance sheet amounts applicable to annuity, long-term care and life businesses are adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding increases or decreases (net of tax) included in accumulated other comprehensive income in AFG's Balance Sheet.\nFixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate-term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions. At December 31, 2015, the average life of AFG's fixed maturities was about 6-1/2 years.\nFair values for AFG's portfolio are determined by AFG's internal investment professionals using data from nationally recognized pricing services as well as non-binding broker quotes. Fair values of equity securities are generally based on published closing prices. For mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), which comprise approximately 18% of AFG's fixed maturities, prices for each security are generally obtained from both pricing services and broker quotes. For the remainder of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio, approximately 80% are priced using pricing services and the balance is priced primarily by\nusing non-binding broker quotes. When prices obtained for the same security vary, AFG's internal investment professionals select the price they believe is most indicative of an exit price.\nThe pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis. Based upon information provided by the pricing services, these inputs include, but are not limited to, recent reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids or offers, reference data, and measures of volatility. Included in the pricing of MBS are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on brokers' prices are classified as Level 3 in the GAAP hierarchy unless the price can be corroborated, for example, by comparison to similar securities priced using observable inputs.\nValuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by AFG's internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price. To validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained, these investment managers consider widely published indices (as benchmarks), recent trades, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers. In addition, AFG communicates directly with pricing services regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing, including verifying, on a test basis, the inputs used by the services to value specific securities.\nIn general, the fair value of AFG's fixed maturity investments is inversely correlated to changes in interest rates. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of such fair values to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on AFG's fixed maturity portfolio and accumulated other comprehensive income that an immediate increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions). Effects of increases or decreases from the 100 basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage impact on fair value of 100 bps increase in interest rates\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax impact on fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offsetting adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and other balance sheet amounts\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated pretax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>(927\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated after-tax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(589\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately 89% of the fixed maturities held by AFG at December 31, 2015, were rated investment grade\u201d (credit rating of AAA to BBB) by nationally recognized rating agencies. Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated and non-investment grade. Management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return.\nMBS are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that, in periods of declining interest rates, mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. Although interest rates have been low in recent years, tighter lending standards have resulted in fewer buyers being able to refinance the mortgages underlying much of AFG's non-agency residential MBS portfolio.\nSummarized information for AFG's MBS (including those classified as trading) at December 31, 2015, is shown in the table below (dollars in millions). Agency-backed securities are those issued by a U.S. government-backed agency; Alt-A mortgages are those with risk profiles between prime and subprime. The majority of the Alt-A securities and substantially all of the subprime securities are backed by fixed-rate mortgages. The average life of the residential and commercial MBS is approximately 4-1/2 years and 3 years, respectively.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value as\n% of Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized\nGain (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Rated\nInvestment\nGrade\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency-backed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-agency prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subprime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d) assigns creditworthiness designations on a scale of 1 to 6 with 1 being the highest quality and 6 being the lowest quality. The NAIC retains third-party investment management firms to assist in the determination of appropriate NAIC designations for mortgage-backed securities based not only on the probability of loss (which is the primary basis of ratings by the major ratings firms), but also on the severity of loss and statutory carrying value. At December 31, 2015, 97% (based on statutory carrying value of $5.28 billion) of AFG's MBS securities had an NAIC designation of 1.\nMunicipal bonds represented approximately 21% of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2015. AFG's municipal bond portfolio is high quality, with 98% of the securities rated investment grade at that date. The portfolio is well diversified across the states of issuance and individual issuers. At December 31, 2015, approximately 75% of the municipal bond portfolio was held in revenue bonds, with the remaining 25% held in general obligation bonds.

a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other-than-temporary,\u201d a provision for impairment is charged to earnings (accounted for as a realized loss) and the cost basis of that investment is reduced by the amount of the charge. The determination of whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary\u201d requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors. Factors considered and resources used by management include:\n a) whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates, \n b) the extent to which fair value is less than cost basis, \n c) cash flow projections received from independent sources, \n d) historical operating, balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer SEC filings and news releases, \n e) near-term prospects for improvement in the issuer and/or its industry, \n f) third party research and communications with industry specialists, \n g) financial models and forecasts, \n h) the continuity of dividend payments, maintenance of investment grade ratings and hybrid nature of certain investments, \n i) discussions with issuer management, and \n j) ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value. \nBased on its analysis of the factors listed above, management believes AFG will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and that AFG has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value and had no intent to sell them at December 31, 2015. Although AFG has the ability to continue holding its investments with unrealized losses, its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers' creditworthiness, decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry, asset/liability management decisions, market movements, changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains. Should AFG's ability or intent change with regard to a particular security, a charge for impairment would likely be required. While it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired, charges for other-than-temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in future periods. Significant declines in the fair value of AFG's investment portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on AFG's liquidity. For information on AFG's realized gains (losses) on securities, including charges for other-than-temporary\u201d impairment, see Results of Operations - Consolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities.\u201d\nUncertainties As more fully explained in the following paragraphs, management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation. Determining the liability is a complex process incorporating input from many areas of the Company including actuarial, underwriting, pricing, claims and operations management.\nThe estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon: (i) the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written ( case reserves\u201d); (ii) estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations; (iii) estimates of claims incurred but not reported or IBNR\u201d (including possible development on known claims); (iv) estimates (based on experience) of expense for investigating and adjusting claims; and (v) the current state of law and coverage litigation.\nThe process used to determine the total reserve for liabilities involves estimating the ultimate incurred losses and LAE, adjusted for amounts already paid on the claims. The IBNR reserve is derived by first estimating the ultimate unpaid reserve liability and subtracting case reserves for loss and LAE.\nIn determining management's best estimate of the ultimate liability, management (including Company actuaries) considers items such as the effect of inflation on medical, hospitalization, material, repair and replacement costs, the nature and maturity of lines of insurance, general economic trends and the legal environment. In addition, historical trends adjusted for changes in underwriting standards, policy provisions, product mix and other factors are analyzed using actuarial reserve development techniques. Weighing all of the factors, the management team determines a single or point\u201d estimate that it records as its best estimate of the ultimate liability. Ranges of loss reserves are not developed by Company actuaries. This reserve analysis and review is completed each quarter and for almost every line of business.\nEach quarterly review includes in-depth analysis of several hundred subdivisions of the business, employing multiple actuarial techniques. For each subdivision, actuaries use informed, professional judgment to adjust these techniques as necessary to respond to specific conditions in the data or within the business.\nSome of the standard actuarial methods employed for the quarterly reserve analysis may include (but may not be limited to):\n \u2022 Case Incurred Development Method \n \u2022 Paid Development Method \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method \n \u2022 Incremental Paid LAE to Paid Loss Methods \nManagement believes that each method has particular strengths and weaknesses and that no single estimation method is most accurate in all situations. When applied to a particular group of claims, the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method can change over time based on the facts and circumstances. Ultimately, the estimation methods chosen are those which management believes produce the most reliable indication for the particular liabilities under review.\nThe period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability is referred to as the tail\u201d. Generally, the same actuarial methods are considered for both short-tail and long-tail lines of business because most of them work properly for both. The methods are designed to incorporate the effects of the differing length of time to settle particular claims. For short-tail lines, management tends to give more weight to the Case Incurred and Paid Development methods, although the various\nmethods tend to produce similar results. For long-tail lines, more judgment is involved, and more weight may be given to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. Liability claims for long-tail lines are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation and the legal environment. Therefore, the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability.\nThe level of detail in which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business. Data is generally analyzed by major product or by coverage within product, using countrywide data; however, in some situations, data may be reviewed by state or region. Appropriate segmentation of the data is determined based on data credibility, homogeneity of development patterns, mix of business, and other actuarial considerations.\nSupplementary statistical information is also reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate to use or if adjustments are needed to particular methods. Such information includes:\n \u2022 Open and closed claim counts \n \u2022 Average case reserves and average incurred on open claims \n \u2022 Closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages \n \u2022 Average closed claim severity \n \u2022 Ultimate claim severity \n \u2022 Reported loss ratios \n \u2022 Projected ultimate loss ratios \n \u2022 Loss payment patterns \nWithin each line, results of individual methods are reviewed, supplementary statistical information is analyzed, and data from underwriting, operating and claim management are considered in deriving management's best estimate of the ultimate liability. This estimate may be the result of one method, a weighted average of several methods, or a judgmental selection as the management team determines is appropriate.\nThe following table shows (in millions) the breakdown of AFG's property and casualty reserves between case reserves, IBNR reserves and LAE reserves (estimated amounts required to adjust, record and settle claims, other than the claim payments themselves).\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Loss Reserves at December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IBNR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nReserve\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statutory Line of Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liability - occurrence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liability - claims made\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial auto/truck liability/medical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special property (fire, allied lines, inland marine, earthquake)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Products liability - occurrence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial multi-peril\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Statutory Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments for GAAP:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves of foreign operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss reserve discounting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Adjustments for GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total GAAP Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses, there is no method or system that can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates. As shown in the reserve development table (loss triangle) on page 7, the original estimates of AFG's liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance and including the effect of special charges for asbestos and environmental exposures, over the past 10 years have developed through December 31, 2015, to be deficient (for four years) by as much as 1.8% and\nredundant (for six years) by as much as 13.3%. Excluding the effect of special charges for asbestos and environmental exposures, the original estimates of AFG's liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance have developed through December 31, 2015 to be redundant (for ten years) by as much as 19.4%. This development illustrates the historical impact caused by variability in factors considered in estimating insurance reserves.\nFollowing is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves of the more significant long-tail lines of business (asbestos and environmental liabilities are separately discussed below). Many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs.\nAn important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future. However, future results could vary due to an unexpected change in the underlying cost trends. This unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation, inflation from social programs, new medical technologies, or other factors such as those listed below in connection with AFG's largest lines of business. It is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables, and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables. However, it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall 1% change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables. Utilizing the effect of a 1% change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than 1% to be estimated by extrapolation. Each additional 1% change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly (about 5%) greater than the effect of the previous 1%. For example, if a 1% change in cost trends in a line of business would change net earnings by $20 million, a 2% change would change net earnings by approximately $41 million.\nThe estimated cumulative impact that a 1% change in cost trends in AFG's more significant lines of property and casualty business (exceeding 5% of total reserves) would have on net earnings is shown below (in millions).

The following table shows (dollars in millions) what the impact on AFG's net earnings would be on the more significant lines of business if the December 31, 2015, reserves (net of reinsurance) developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5-yr.

Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers' compensation include:\n \u2022 Legislative actions and regulatory and legal interpretations \n \u2022 Future medical cost inflation \n \u2022 Economic conditions \n \u2022 Timing of claims reporting \nIn April 2014, AFG acquired Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and related companies, a leading provider of workers' compensation solutions in the southeastern United States. The Summit acquisition significantly increased AFG's volume of workers' compensation business and improved its geographic diversity. Approximately 23% and 19% of AFG's workers' compensation reserves at December 31, 2015 relate to policies written in Florida and California, respectively. Over the past 12 years in both states, there have been numerous revisions to workers' compensation regulations and operating environments, adding difficulty and uncertainty to the estimation of related liabilities.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $45 million in 2015 due to lower than anticipated claim severity across all regions of the country. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in both 2014 and 2013, as favorable reserve development in the business written in California was partially offset by adverse reserve development in other states.\nOther Liability - Occurrence\nThis long-tail line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence, carelessness, or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - occurrence include:\n \u2022 Litigious climate \n \u2022 Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues \n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards \n \u2022 Outside counsel costs \n \u2022 Timing of claims reporting \nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in 2015, $15 million in 2014 and $11 million in 2013 related to its other liability - occurrence coverage where both the frequency and severity of claims in excess and umbrella liability coverages were lower than previously projected.\nWhile management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above, more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held. For recent accident years, more weight is given to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.\nCommercial Auto/Truck Liability/Medical\nThis line of business is a mix of coverage protecting the insured against legal liability for property damage or personal injury to others arising from the operation of commercial motor vehicles. The property damage liability exposure is usually short-tail with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims. The bodily injury and medical payments exposures are longer-tailed; although the claim reporting is relatively quick, the final settlement can take longer to achieve. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto/truck liability/medical are similar to other liability - occurrence and include:\n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards \n \u2022 Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues \n \u2022 Litigious climate and trends \n \u2022 Change in frequency of severe accidents \n \u2022 Health care costs and utilization of medical services by injured parties \nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $20 million in 2015, $28 million in 2014 and $37 million in 2013 for this line of business as claim severity has been significantly higher than expected in accident years 2010 and subsequent.\nOther Liability - Claims Made\nThis long-tail line of business consists mostly of directors' and officers' liability ( D&O\u201d). Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - claims made include:\n \u2022 Litigious climate \n \u2022 Economic conditions \n \u2022 Variability of stock prices \n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards  The general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits and other situations that trigger coverage under D&O policies. For example, from 2008 to 2010,\neconomic conditions led to higher frequency of claims, particularly in the D&O policies for small account and not-for-profit organizations. Since then, claim frequency has continually decreased from its peak in 2010, offsetting increased claim severity.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $12 million in 2015, $18 million in 2014 and $41 million in 2013 on its D&O business as claim severity was less than expected across several prior accident years.\nWhile management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above, more judgment may be needed to determine appropriate reserves due to the complexity of claims, litigation and the length of time necessary to determine exposure.\nReserves of Foreign Operations\nReserves of foreign operations relate primarily to the operations of Marketform Group, Limited, AFG's wholly-owned United Kingdom-based Lloyd's insurer. Historically, the largest line of business written by Marketform has been non-U.S. medical malpractice, which provides coverage for injuries and damages caused by medical care providers, including but not limited to, hospitals and their physicians. Although Marketform offers this product in approximately 30 countries, the majority of the business has been written in the United Kingdom, Australia and Italy. In addition, Marketform writes general liability, marine, equine, professional indemnity and directors and officers liability insurance. Significant variables in estimating the loss reserves include:\n \u2022 Litigious environment \n \u2022 Magnitude of court awards \n \u2022 A slow moving judicial system including varying approaches to medical malpractice claims among courts \n \u2022 Trends in claim costs, including medical cost inflation \nMarketform recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $44 million in 2015, $14 million in 2014 and $1 million in 2013. The adverse development in 2015 and 2014 was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, primarily Dutch hospital medical malpractice, Australian and other general liability and personal accident insurance. In October of 2015, AFG announced the hiring of a new management team at Marketform with extensive underwriting experience in the Lloyd's market. The new management is in the process of evaluating Marketform's operational structure and lines of business with the goal of improving the profitability of these operations.\nRecoverables from Reinsurers and Availability of Reinsurance AFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as reinsurance contracts do not relieve AFG of its liability to policyholders. To mitigate this risk, substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S&P ratings or is secured by funds withheld\u201d or other collateral.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which are beyond AFG's control and which may affect AFG's level of business and profitability. Although the cost of certain reinsurance programs may increase, management believes that AFG will be able to maintain adequate reinsurance coverage at acceptable rates without a material adverse effect on AFG's results of operations. AFG's gross and net combined ratios are shown in the table below.\nSee Item 1 - Business - Property and Casualty Insurance Segment - Reinsurance\u201d for more information on AFG's reinsurance programs. For additional information on the effect of reinsurance on AFG's historical results of operations see Note O - Insurance - Reinsurance\u201d to the financial statements and the gross loss development table under Item 1 - Business - Property and Casualty Insurance Segment - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.\u201d\nThe following table illustrates the effect that purchasing property and casualty reinsurance has had on AFG's combined ratio over the last three years.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Before reinsurance (gross)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual (net of reinsurance)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutside of its property and casualty operations, AFG also has reinsurance recoverables totaling $355 million, including$315 million related to the run-off life business. These recoverables include $184 million from Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America (rated A+ by A.M. Best).\nAsbestos and Environmental-related ( A&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves Asbestos and environmental reserves of the property and casualty group consisted of the following (in millions):\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A&E reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance recoverable, net of allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross A&E reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsbestos reserves include claims asserting alleged injuries and damages from exposure to asbestos. Environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted waste sites.\nAsbestos claims against manufacturers, distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of their policies which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer's liability. In recent years, a number of asbestos claims are being presented as non-products\u201d claims, such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property, under the premises or operations section of their policies. Unlike products exposures, these non-products exposures typically had no aggregate limits, creating potentially greater exposure for insurers. Further, in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage, some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non-products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non-products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits. AFG, along with other insurers, is and will be subject to such non-products claims. It is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non-products coverage or whether AFG and other insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses. Therefore, the future impact of such efforts is uncertain.\nApproximately 43% of AFG's net asbestos reserves relate to policies written directly by AFG subsidiaries. Claims from these policies generally are product oriented claims with only a limited amount of non-products exposures, and are dominated by small to mid-sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants. The remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods 1954 to 1983. The asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties. A majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than $100,000 to AFG. Asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers, distributors and installers. Pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites.\nEstablishing reserves for A&E claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims. For this group of claims, traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a range of reasonably possible losses cannot be estimated. Case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified. In addition to the case reserves established for known claims, management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims. These additional reserves are management's best estimate based on periodic comprehensive studies and internal reviews adjusted for payments and identifiable changes, supplemented by management's review of industry information about such claims, with due consideration to individual claim situations.\nManagement believes that estimating the ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, novel theories of coverage, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. The casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase. Environmental claims likewise present challenges in prediction, due to uncertainty regarding the interpretation of insurance policies, complexities regarding multi-party involvements at sites, evolving cleanup standards and protracted time periods required to assess the level of cleanup required at contaminated sites.\nThe following factors could impact AFG's reserves and payments:\n \u2022 There is a growing interest at the state level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved. These developments are fluid and could result in piecemeal state-by-state solutions. \n \u2022 The manner by which bankruptcy courts are addressing asbestos liabilities is in flux. \n \u2022 AFG's insureds may make claims alleging significant non-products exposures. \nWhile management believes that AFG's reserves for A&E claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims, actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims, the impact of recent bankruptcy filings, and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists, whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage, how claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years, and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims. A 1% variation in loss cost trends, caused by any of the factors previously described, would change net income by approximately $20 million.\nAFG tracks its A&E claims by policyholder. The following table shows, by type of claim, the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment. Policyholder counts represent policies written by AFG subsidiaries and do not include assumed reinsurance.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of policyholders with no indemnity payments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of policyholders with indemnity payments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts paid (net of reinsurance recoveries) for asbestos and environmental claims, including loss adjustment expenses, were as follows (in millions):\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos - two large claims (*)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos - other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) Asbestos claims paid in 2013 include payments totaling $106 million associated with the settlement of A.P. Green Industries and another large claim. Substantially all of the settlement amounts had been accrued for in prior years. \nThe survival ratio is a measure often used by industry analysts to compare A&E reserves strength among companies. This ratio is typically calculated by dividing reserves for A&E exposures by the three year average of paid losses, and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to pay off current reserves based on recent average payments. Because this ratio can be significantly impacted by a number of factors such as loss payout variability, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy based simply on the survival ratio. At December 31, 2015, the property and casualty insurance segment's three year survival ratios, excluding amounts associated with the settlements of A.P. Green Industries and another large claim, were 14.8 times paid losses for the asbestos reserves, 8.2 times paid losses for environmental reserves and 11.4 times paid losses for total A&E reserves. Overall, these ratios compare favorably with data published by A.M. Best in October 2015, which indicate that industry survival ratios were 8.8 for asbestos, 6.3 for environmental, and 8.2 for total A&E reserves at December 31, 2014.\nAFG has periodically conducted comprehensive external studies of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run-off operations of its property and casualty insurance segment and exposures related to its former railroad and manufacturing operations with the aid of specialty actuarial, engineering and consulting firms and outside counsel, generally every two years, with an in-depth internal review during the intervening years.\nAs a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2015, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $67 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $25 million (net of reinsurance) and its\nenvironmental reserves by $42 million (net of reinsurance). As the overall industry exposure to asbestos has matured, the focus of litigation has shifted to smaller companies and companies with ancillary exposures. AFG's insureds with these exposures have been the driver of the property and casualty segment's asbestos reserve increases in recent years; AFG has seen increased estimates for indemnity and defense compared to prior studies. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased. As in past years, there were no new or emerging broad industry trends that were identified in this study.\nAn in-depth internal review of AFG's A&E reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2014 by AFG's internal A&E claims specialists and actuaries in consultation with specialty outside counsel and an outside consultant. As a result of the review, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $24 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $4 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $20 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to AFG's increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nAs a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2013, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $54 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $16 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $38 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in the property and casualty segment's asbestos reserves was driven primarily by slightly higher than expected loss experience, higher defense costs and some increased claim severity. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to a small number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nContingencies related to Subsidiaries' Former Operations The A&E studies and reviews discussed above encompassed reserves for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations disposed of by American Premier's predecessor and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by American Premier and its subsidiaries and by Great American Financial Resources, Inc. Charges resulting from the A&E studies and review were $12 million in 2015, $6 million in 2014 and $22 million in 2013. For a discussion of the charges recorded for those operations, see Holding Company, Other and Unallocated - Results of Operations.\u201d Liabilities for claims and contingencies arising from these former railroad and manufacturing operations totaled $88 million at December 31, 2015. For a discussion of the uncertainties in determining the ultimate liability, see Note M - Contingencies\u201d to the financial statements.\nRun-off Long-term Care Insurance AFG, as well as other companies that sell long-term care products, have accumulated relatively limited claims, lapse and mortality experience, making it difficult to predict future claims. Long-term care claims tend to be much higher in dollar amount and longer in duration than other health care products. In addition, long-term care claims are incurred much later in the life of a policy than most other health products. These factors made it difficult to appropriately price this product and were instrumental in AFG's decision to stop writing new policies in January 2010. In December 2015, AFG completed the sale of United Teacher Associates Insurance Company and Continental General Insurance Company, the legal entities containing substantially all of its run-off long-term care insurance business, to HC2 Holdings, Inc. ( HC2\u201d) for approximately $13 million in net proceeds. AFG may also receive up to $13 million of additional proceeds from HC2 in the future contingent upon the release of certain statutory-basis liabilities of the legal entities sold by AFG. In connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, AFG agreed to provide up to an aggregate of $35 million of capital support for the insurance companies, on an as-needed basis to maintain specified surplus levels, subject to immediate reimbursement by HC2 through a five-year capital maintenance agreement. With the completion of this sale, AFG has divested substantially all of its long-term care business (96% as measured by net statutory reserves as of November 30, 2015) and will retain only a small block of long-term care insurance (1,700 policies) with approximately $34 million of reserves. AFG will continue to service and accept renewal premiums on its remaining outstanding policies, which are guaranteed renewable.\nMANAGED INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nAccounting standards require AFG to consolidate its investments in collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) entities that it manages and owns an interest in (in the form of debt). See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements. The effect of consolidating these entities is shown in the tables below (in millions). The Before CLO Consolidation\u201d columns include AFG's investment and earnings in the CLOs on an unconsolidated basis.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATING BALANCE SHEET\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td>

million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014 reflecting higher core net operating earnings and a gain on the sale of an apartment property, partially offset by realized losses on securities in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to realized gains on securities in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a fourth quarter loss reported upon closing of the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business. Core net operating earnings increased $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due primarily to higher core underwriting profit in the property and casualty insurance segment, higher earnings in the annuity segment and improved core operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders decreased $100 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business, higher special A&E charges and realized losses on securities in 2015 compared to realized gains on securities in 2014, partially offset by the gain on the sale of Le Pavillon Hotel and an apartment property and higher core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings\nincreased $47 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to higher underwriting profit and higher net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment and improved core operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders decreased $19 million for the full-year of 2014 compared to the same period of 2013 reflecting significantly lower realized gains on securities, partially offset by higher core net operating earnings and lower special A&E charges. Core net operating earnings increased $54 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to higher underwriting profit and higher net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment and lower holding company expenses.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and income and expenses related to the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>P&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off long-term care and life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consol.

earnings to GAAP net earnings under Results of Operations - General\u201d for details on the tax and noncontrolling interest impacts of these reconciling items. \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment - Results of Operations Performance measures such as underwriting profit or loss and related combined ratios are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and commissions and other underwriting expenses to premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect net investment income, other income, other expenses or federal income taxes.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $179 million in GAAP pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $36 million (25%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $21 million (15%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation and Specialty casualty insurance sub-segments. The increase in GAAP earnings also includes a $15 million pretax gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums ceded\n</td> <td>(300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>1,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unearned premiums\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and other underwriting expenses\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting gain\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses, net (*)\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax non-core gain on sale of apartment property\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*) Excludes the $15 million pretax non-core gain on sale of an apartment property.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate - including discontinued lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG's combined ratio has been better than the industry average for 28 of the last 30 years. Management believes that AFG's insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of its specialty niche focus, product line diversification, stringent underwriting discipline and alignment of compensation incentives.\nAFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial.\nTo understand the overall profitability of particular lines, the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered. Certain short-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily property coverages) generally have quick loss payouts, which reduce the time funds are held, thereby limiting investment income earned thereon. In contrast, long-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily liability coverages and workers' compensation) generally have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle, thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received.\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums ( GWP\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were $1.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $1.30 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $53 million (4%).

Overall average renewal rates were up less than 1% in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nProperty and transportation Gross written premiums increased $33 million (7%) in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 reflecting higher gross written premiums in the transportation and agricultural businesses and new gross written premiums from the Singapore branch, which opened for business in June 2015, partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the property and inland marine and ocean marine businesses. Average renewal rates for this group were up approximately 2% in the fourth quarter of 2015, including a 4% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 4 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 reflecting higher cessions of crop insurance premiums.\nSpecialty casualty Gross written premiums increased $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The majority of businesses in this group reported modest growth, particularly the excess and surplus businesses. This growth was partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the general liability business, primarily the result of competitive market conditions, re-underwriting efforts within the Florida homebuilders market and the slowdown within the energy sector. Average renewal rates for this group were down approximately 2% in the fourth quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower pricing in the workers' compensation business. Excluding the workers' compensation business, average renewal rates in this group increased approximately 1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums declined 1 percentage point for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.\nSpecialty financial Gross written premiums increased $19 million (12%) in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to growth in the financial institutions business. Average renewal rates for this group were up approximately 1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums decreased 3 percentage points, reflecting a decline in auto dealer business, which is heavily reinsured.\nOther specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments.\nCombined Ratio\nPerformance measures such as the combined ratio are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) and underwriting expense ratios.

casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $100 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $21 million (27%). The higher underwriting profit in the 2015 fourth quarter reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation and Specialty casualty sub-segments.\nProperty and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was $34 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $12 million (55%). This increase is due primarily to higher accident year profitability in the transportation and agricultural businesses, partially offset by adverse prior year reserve development at National Interstate, as well as lower profitability in the property and inland marine and ocean marine businesses.\nSpecialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $14 million (39%). This increase is due primarily to higher profitability in the workers' compensation, targeted markets, executive liability and excess and surplus businesses, partially offset by underwriting losses at Marketform.\nSpecialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $3 million (17%). Catastrophe losses were $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to negligible catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOther specialty Underwriting profit for this group was $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $2 million (67%).

property and casualty insurance operations was 61.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 62.8% for the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 1.4%.\nProperty and transportation The 2.1 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses is due primarily to higher profitability in the agricultural businesses and lower commercial auto claims in the transportation businesses, partially offset by higher current year losses in the ocean marine business.\nSpecialty casualty The loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses was comparable in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014.\nSpecialty financial The 4.8 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects an improvement in the loss and LAE ratio of the financial institutions, fidelity, equipment leasing and surety businesses.\nNet prior year reserve development\nAFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to net adverse reserve development related to prior accident years of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an improvement of $15 million.\nProperty and transportation Net adverse reserve development of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects higher than expected claim severity in commercial auto liability insurance at National Interstate and higher than expected claim frequency in the ocean marine business, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business. Net adverse reserve development of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects higher than expected claim frequency in the ocean marine business and higher than anticipated claim severity in the trucking operations, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business.\nSpecialty casualty Net favorable reserve development of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in workers' compensation business, excess liability insurance and directors and officers liability insurance, partially offset by adverse reserve development at Marketform. Net adverse reserve development of $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects adverse reserve development at Marketform and higher than expected claim severity in contractor claims and in a run-off book of casualty business, partially offset by lower than anticipated claim severity in specialty workers' compensation business.\nSpecialty financial Net favorable reserve development of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity business, lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the surety business and lower than expected claim severity on a run-off block of collateral value insurance, partially offset by higher than expected claim severity in products for financial institutions and in the trade credit business. Net favorable reserve development of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects lower than expected claim severity in the surety and fidelity businesses.\nOther specialty In addition to the development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net favorable reserve development of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting amortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive insurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of businesses in 1998 and 2001 and reserve development associated with AFG's internal reinsurance program.\nCatastrophe losses\nAFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. Based on data available at December 31, 2015, AFG's exposure to a catastrophic earthquake or windstorm that industry models indicate could occur once in every 500 years (a 500-year event\u201d) is expected to be less than 3.5% of AFG's shareholders' equity. The $5 million of catastrophe losses in the Specialty financial group in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted primarily from flooding in the midwestern United States.\nCommissions and Other Underwriting Expenses\nAFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses ( U/W Exp\u201d) were $327 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $303 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $24 million (8%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio, calculated as commissions and other underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned, was 29.2% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 28.6% for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 0.6 percentage points.

In recent years, yields available in the financial markets on fixed maturity securities have generally declined, placing downward pressure on AFG's investment portfolio yield.

The property and casualty segment's overall yield on investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 3.25% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 3.54% for the fourth quarter of 2014, a decline of 0.29 percentage points, reflecting lower income from equity in the earnings of limited partnerships and from other investments.\nProperty and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net\nGAAP other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was net income of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a net expense of $11 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an improvement of $16 million (145%). Core other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was a net expense of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $1 million (9%).

While AFG's average annuity investments (at amortized cost) were 13% higher for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, the benefit of this growth was partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields. In addition, strong stock market performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 had a positive impact on the fair value accounting for fixed-indexed annuities ( FIAs\u201d). Conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the favorable impact of the increase in the stock market was more than offset by a decrease in longer-term interest rates and resulted in a negative impact on the fair value accounting for FIAs. AFG's periodic detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations resulted in a net annuity expense reduction of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe following table details AFG's earnings before income taxes from its annuity operations for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits (*)\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetail of annuity earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes -

Performance measures such as net interest spread and net spread earned are often presented by annuity businesses to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance.\nNet Spread on Fixed Annuities (excludes variable annuity earnings)\nThe table below (dollars in millions) details the components of these spreads for AFG's fixed annuity operations (including fixed-indexed annuities):\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>26,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (except as noted):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (as % of fixed annuity investments)\n</td> <td>4.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited - fixed\n</td> <td>(2.12\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.21\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest spread\n</td> <td>2.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefit expenses, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(0.31\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.20\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>(0.75\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.65\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>(0.32\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.28\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.31\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's net spread earned on fixed annuities:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities - before impact of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>1.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (*)\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.14\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities offset by an estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs. \nAnnuity Net Investment Income\nNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $309 million compared to $285 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $24 million (8%). This increase reflects the growth in AFG's annuity business, partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's annuity operations, calculated as net investment income divided by average investment balances (at amortized cost), declined by 0.20 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This decline in net investment yield reflects (i) lower income from other investments, (ii) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (iii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets.\nAnnuity Interest Credited - Fixed\nInterest credited - fixed for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $138 million compared to $127 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $11 million (9%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The\naverage interest rate credited to policyholders, calculated as interest credited divided by average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, decreased 0.09 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, interest rates credited on new premiums generally ranged from 1.00% to 2.80%.\nAnnuity Net Interest Spread\nAFG's net interest spread decreased 0.11 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the impact of lower investment yields. In addition, features included in current annuity product offerings allow AFG to achieve its desired profitability at a lower net interest spread than historical product offerings. As a result of these two items, AFG expects its net interest spread to narrow in the future.\nAnnuity Policy Charges and Other Miscellaneous Income\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income, which consist primarily of surrender charges and the amortization of deferred upfront policy charges (unearned revenue), were $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $13 million (54%). Excluding the impact of an unlocking charge of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and unlocking income of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income were $13 million in 2015 compared to $14 million in 2014, a decrease of $1 million (7%).\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income.\nOther Annuity Benefits\nOther annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees (excluding the impact of unlocking) for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $19 million compared to $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $6 million (46%). In addition to interest credited to policyholders' accounts and the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, annuity benefits expense also includes the following expenses (in millions, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees): Table 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in expected death and annuitization reserve\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of sales inducements\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other benefit reserves\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offset guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve related to FIAs is inversely impacted by the calculated FIA embedded derivative reserve as the value to policyholders of the guaranteed withdrawal benefits increases when the benefit of stock market participation decreases.\nAnnuity Acquisition Expenses\nExcluding the impact of unlocking charges (expense reductions), AFG's amortization of DPAC and commission expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated was 0.75% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 0.65% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and has generally ranged between 0.70% and 0.80%. Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG's fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the negative impact of lower interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2014 on the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting deceleration in the amortization of DPAC. During the third quarter of 2015, the deceleration in the amortization of DPAC caused by the negative impact of poor stock market performance on the fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities was limited on certain recently issued products. This prior period limitation had a $5 million favorable impact on the amortization of DPAC related to the fair value accounting for those derivatives when the stock market rebounded during the fourth quarter of 2015. This favorable impact is reported in the impact on DPAC of derivatives related to FIAs.\nAnnuity Other Expenses\nAnnuity other expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $22 million compared to $17 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $5 million (29%). The fourth quarter of 2014 includes the favorable impact of settling certain accrued expenses\nat a lower cost than previously estimated. Annuity other expenses represent primarily general and administrative expenses, as well as selling and issuance expenses that are not deferred. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses increased 0.04 percentage points for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In general, this percentage is expected to decrease as AFG's annuity business grows and annuity other expenses remain relatively stable.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG's fixed-indexed annuities, which represented approximately 60% of annuity benefits accumulated at December 31, 2015, provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG's strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be marked-to-market through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG's annuity benefits accumulated, see Note D - Fair Value Measurements\u201d to the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities had a nominal impact on annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased annuity benefits by $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $18 million impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects the negative impact of lower interest rates on the derivatives, partially offset by the favorable impact of strong stock market performance.\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products. The table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes - before change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs. \nAs illustrated in the table above, the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, including the related impact on amortization of DPAC increased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and decreased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to future write-offs of DPAC or the present value of future profits on business in force of companies acquired ( PVFP\u201d).\nAnnuity Net Spread Earned on Fixed Annuities\nAFG's net spread earned on fixed annuities decreased 0.01 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the 0.11 percentage points decrease in AFG's net interest spread and the impact of growth in AFG's annuity business on other expenses and other annuity benefits as a percent of fixed annuity benefits accumulated discussed above, partially offset by the net impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives and related DPAC amortization offset discussed above.\nAnnuity Benefits Accumulated\nAnnuity premiums received and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in annuity benefits accumulated rather than as revenue and expense. Increases in this liability for interest credited and other benefits are charged to expense and decreases for surrender and other policy charges are credited to other income.\nFor certain products, annuity benefits accumulated also includes reserves for accrued persistency and premium bonuses, excess benefits expected to be paid on future deaths and annuitizations ( EDAR\u201d) and guaranteed withdrawal benefits.

As a result of these reviews, AFG recorded net expense reductions related to its annuity business of $10 million in 2015 and $1 million in 2014, which impacted AFG's financial statements as follows (in millions):\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unearned revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-indexed annuity embedded derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales inducements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annuity benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expense reduction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2015 net expense reduction was due primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions to reflect higher than previously projected net interest spreads as well as the impact of higher assets under management and expense discipline. Reinvestment rates used to project future investment yields are based primarily on 7-year and 10-year corporate bond yields. For the 2015 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 3.87% in 2016, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.53% in 2022 and beyond.\nThe 2014 net expense reduction was due primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions to reflect a decrease in future expected call option costs related to the fixed-indexed annuity business and lower lapses, partially offset by lower future investment yield assumptions. For the 2014 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 3.57% in 2015, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.54% in 2022 and beyond.\nAnnuity Earnings before Income Taxes Reconciliation\nThe following table reconciles the net spread earned on AFG's fixed annuities to overall annuity pretax earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on investments in excess of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (*)\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable annuity earnings\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) Net investment income (as a % of investments) of 4.65% and 4.85% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, multiplied by the difference between average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost) and average fixed annuity benefits accumulated in each period. \nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life Segment - Results of Operations AFG's run-off long-term care and life segment incurred GAAP pretax losses of $4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015, which includes a $4 million pretax non-core realized loss adjustment to the previously recognized $162 million estimated pretax loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.

Net Investment Income\nAFG recorded net investment income on investments held outside of its insurance operations of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nHolding Company and Other - P&C Fees and Related Expenses\nSummit, the workers' compensation insurance business that AFG acquired in April 2014, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG's property and casualty businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In the fourth quarter of 2015, AFG collected $16 million in fees for these services. Management views this fee income, net of the $10 million in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG's segmented results. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, these fees are shown in other income and the related expenses are shown in other expenses in AFG's Statement of Earnings.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Income\nOther income in the table above includes $4 million and $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively, in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG's consolidated managed investment entities). The $7 million in management fees in the fourth quarter of 2014 includes a $4 million incentive management fee earned in connection with the liquidation of a CLO. The management fees are eliminated in consolidation - see the other income line in the Consolidate MIEs column under Results of Operations - Segmented Statement of Earnings.\u201d Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its insurance operations of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Results for the fourth quarter of 2014 include $3 million in income related to the sale of real estate.\nHolding Company and Other - Interest Charges on Borrowed Money\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $3 million (16%).

AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in November 2015 and $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in late September 2014. The impact of lower average indebtedness during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 and the favorable impact of the interest rate swap on the 9-7/8% Senior Notes due June 2019 that was entered into in June 2015 resulted in a $3 million decrease in interest expense for AFG's holding companies in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Expenses\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded other expenses of $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $9 million (31%). The $9 million increase reflects a $2 million charge related to AFG's former railroad and manufacturing operations and higher other holding company expenses.\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities AFG's consolidated realized gains (losses) on securities, which are not allocated to segments, were losses of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to gains of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $29 million (363%).

Under the new guidance, there are no longer any CLO earnings or losses to be attributed to noncontrolling interests in AFG's Statement of Earnings.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and operations attributable to noncontrolling interests of the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>P&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off long-term care and life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consol.

of Operations - General\u201d for details on the tax and noncontrolling interest impacts of these reconciling items. \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment - Results of Operations AFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $576 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 compared to $456 million in 2014, an increase of $120 million (26%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $577 million in 2015 compared to $480 million in 2014, an increase of $97 million (20%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG's property and casualty insurance sub-segments, higher net investment income (due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the Summit acquisition on April 1, 2014) and lower net expenses. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 also reflects pretax non-core gains of $51 million on the sale of Le Pavillon Hotel and $15 million on the sale of an apartment property, partially offset by higher non-core special A&E charges in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $456 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2014 compared to $375 million in 2013, an increase of $81 million (22%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $480 million in 2014 compared to $429 million in 2013, an increase of $51 million (12%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty group and Property and transportation group and higher net investment income (due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the April 2014 Summit acquisition), partially offset by higher other net expenses. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings also reflects lower non-core special A&E charges in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 -
