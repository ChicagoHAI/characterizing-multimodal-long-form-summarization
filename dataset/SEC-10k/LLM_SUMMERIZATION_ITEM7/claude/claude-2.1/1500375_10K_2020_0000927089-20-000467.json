Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOur profitability depends primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets, principally loans, investment securities, and interest-earning deposits in other institutions, and interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. Net interest income is dependent upon the level of interest rates and the extent to which such rates are changing. Our profitability also depends, to a lesser extent, on non-interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest expenses, and federal income taxes. Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana had net income of $3.9 million in fiscal 2020 compared to net income of $4.7 million in fiscal 2019.\nOur business consists primarily of originating single-family real estate loans secured by property in our market area and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, and real estate secured lines of credit which typically have higher rates and shorter terms than single-family loans. Although our loans are primarily funded by certificates of deposit, which typically have a higher interest rate than passbook accounts, it is our policy to require commercial customers to have a deposit relationship with us, which primarily consist of NOW accounts. Due to the continued low interest rate environment, we have sold a substantial amount of our fixed rate single-family residential loan originations in recent periods. We have also sold investment securities available-for-sale to realize gains in the portfolio. Because of an increase in our average cost of funds on our interest bearing liabilities, our net interest margin decreased from 3.78% to 3.46% during fiscal 2020 compared to 2019, and our net interest income decreased $132,000 to $15.2 million for fiscal 2020 as compared to $15.3 million for fiscal 2019. We expect to continue to emphasize consumer and commercial lending in the future in order to improve the yield on our portfolio.\nHome Federal Bancorp's operations and profitability are subject to changes in interest rates, applicable statutes and regulations, and general economic conditions, as well as other factors beyond our control.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is focused on operating a growing and profitable community-oriented financial institution. Our current business strategy includes:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Continuing to Grow and Diversify Our Loan Portfolio. We intend to grow and continue to diversify of loan portfolio by, among other things, emphasizing the origination of commercial real estate and business loans. At June 30, 2020, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $87.1 million, or 23.83% of the total loan portfolio. Our commercial business loans amounted to $81.9 million, or 22.41% of the total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and development, and consumer loans all typically have higher yields and are more interest sensitive than long-term single-family residential mortgage loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Diversify Our Products and Services. We intend to continue to emphasize our commercial business products to provide a full-service banking relationship to our commercial customers. We have introduced mobile and Internet banking and remote deposit capture, to better serve our commercial clients. Additionally, we have developed new deposit products focused on expanding our deposit base to new types of customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Managing Our Expenses. We have incurred significant additional expenses related to personnel and infrastructure in recent periods as we implemented our business strategy. Our efficiency ratio, net interest income plus non-interest income divided by non-interest expense, for 2020 was 64.9% compared to 62.6% for fiscal 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Enhancing Core Earnings. We expect to continue to emphasize commercial real estate and business loans, which generally bear interest rates higher than residential real estate loans, and sell a substantial part of our fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expanding Our Franchise in our Market Area and Contiguous Communities. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to expand our market area by opening additional de novo banking offices and possibly through acquisitions of other financial institutions and banking related businesses. We expect to focus on contiguous areas to our current locations in Caddo and Bossier Parishes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Maintain Our Asset Quality. At June 30, 2020, our non-performing assets totaled $7.2 million, or 1.39% of total assets. We had other real estate owned consisting of two commercial real estate properties with a carrying value of $950,000 at June 30, 2020. We intend to continue to stress maintaining high asset quality, even as we continue to grow our institution and diversify our loan portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Cross-Selling Products and Services and Emphasizing Local Decision Making. We have promoted cross-selling products and services in our branch offices and emphasized our local decision making and streamlined loan approval process.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn reviewing and understanding financial information for Home Federal Bancorp, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. We have identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy where amounts are sensitive to material variation. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate for probable losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio but which have not yet been realized as of the date of our consolidated balance sheet. It is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that management believes will cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans, and current economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, exposure at default, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios, and general amounts for historical loss experience. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant changes as more information becomes available.\nWhile management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance. Historically, our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management's initial estimates. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as an integral part of their examination processes periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. Realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income. We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors. We may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change.\nCOVID-19\nIn light of the recent events surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic, the Company is continually assessing the effects of the pandemic on its employees, customers and communities. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted. The CARES Act contains many provisions related to banking, lending, mortgage forbearance and taxation. The Company has been working diligently to help support its customers through the SBA Paycheck Protection Program ( SBA PPP\u201d), loan modifications and loan deferrals. As of June 30, 2020 Home Federal Bank has funded 374 SBA PPP loans totaling approximately $46.2 million with an average loan balance of $124,000 to existing customers and key prospects located primarily in our trade area of NW Louisiana. Our commercial lenders and operational support staff have worked tirelessly over the past few weeks to accomplish what seemed to be an insurmountable task in providing a lifeline to our small community businesses. We believe the customer interaction during this time provides a real opportunity to broaden and deepen our customer relationships while benefiting our community.\nHome Federal Bank is working with customers affected by COVID-19 through payment accommodations on their loans. In accordance with FDIC guidance, borrowers who were current prior to becoming affected by COVID-19, that received payment accommodations as a result of the pandemic, generally are not reported as past due. Effects of COVID-19 may negatively impact management assumptions and estimates, such as the allowance for loan losses. The Bank is evaluating all payment accommodations to customers to identify and quantify any impact they may have on the Bank. However, it is difficult to assess or predict how and to what extent COVID-19 will affect the Company in the future. Please see the section titled Additional COVID-19 Information\u201d for additional information related to actions taken.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nAt June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bancorp reported total assets of $518.2 million, an increase of $75.8 million, or 17.1%, compared to total assets of $442.5 million at June 30, 2019. The increase in assets was comprised primarily of increases in cash and cash equivalents of $36.8 million, or 203.0%, from $18.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $54.9 million at June 30, 2020, loans receivable net of $35.8 million, or 11.0%, from $324.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $359.9 million at June 30, 2020, loans held-for-sale of $6.2 million, or 71.9%, from $8.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $14.8 million at June 30, 2020, accrued interest receivable of $688,000, or 58.7%, from $1.2 million at June 30, 2019 to $1.9 million at June 30, 2020, and premises and equipment of $558,000, or 4.1%, from $13.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $14.1 million at June 30, 2020. These increases were partially offset by decreases in investment securities of $4.1 million, or 6.1%, from $67.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $62.9 million at June 30, 2020, real estate owned of $416,000, or 30.5%, from $1.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $950,000 at June 30, 2020, and deferred tax assets of $92,000, or 10.8%, from $849,000 at June 30, 2019 to $757,000 at June 30, 2020. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to deposits associated with SBA PPP loans. The decrease in investment securities was primarily due to $17.0 million of principal repayments on mortgage backed securities and $9.9 million from the sale of mortgage backed securities, partially offset by the purchases of $21.2 million of mortgage-backed securities, a purchase of one municipal bond for $245,000, and an increase of $1.1 million in the market value adjustments on available for sale securities. The increase in loans held-for-sale resulted primarily from an increase in loans originated for sale during the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in real estate owned was due to the sale of four one-to-four family residences and one residential lot during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nLoans receivable, net increased $35.8 million, or 11.0%, from $324.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $359.9 million at June 30, 2020. The increase in loans receivable, net was attributable primarily to increases in commercial business loans of $45.9 million, commercial real estate loans of $3.7 million, land loans of $2.0 million, multi-family residential loans of $1.3 million, consumer loans of $211,000 and equity and second mortgage loans of $148,000, partially offset by decreases in one-to-four-family residential of $10.8 million, equity lines of credit of $3.4 million and construction loans of $1.3 million at June 30, 2020, compared to the prior year. At June 30, 2020, the balance of purchased loans approximated $2.9 million, which consisted solely of one-to-four family residential loans purchased from a mortgage originator headquartered in Arkansas. We have not purchased any loans since fiscal 2008. In recent years, there have been significant loan prepayments due to the heavy volume of loan refinancing, however, the rate of prepayments has been slowing. With interest rates continuing at historical lows, management is reluctant to invest in long-term, fixed rate mortgage loans for the portfolio and instead sells the majority of the long-term, fixed rate mortgage loan production.\nIn recent periods we diversified the loan products we offer and increased our efforts to originate higher yielding commercial real estate loans and lines of credit and commercial business loans which were deemed attractive due to their generally higher yields and shorter anticipated lives compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank had $87.1 million of commercial real estate loans, 23.83% of the total loan portfolio, and $81.9 million of commercial business loans, 22.41% of the total loan portfolio. Although commercial loans are generally considered to have greater credit risk than other certain types of loans, we attempt to mitigate such risk by originating such loans in our market area to known borrowers.\nSecurities available-for-sale increased $405,000, or 1.0%, from $41.7 million at June 30, 2019 to $42.1 million at June 30, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from purchases of $21.2 million in mortgage-backed securities and increases in market values of securities of $1.1 million, partially offset by principal repayments of $12.3 million and sales of $9.6 million.\nSecurities held-to-maturity decreased $4.5 million, from $25.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $20.9 million at June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to normal principal pay downs on these securities. We chose to place these securities in held-to-maturity as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $36.8 million, or 203.0%, from $18.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $54.9 million at June 30, 2020. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to increases in total deposits related to SBA PPP loans funded.\nTotal liabilities increased $75.6 million, or 19.3%, from $392.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $467.7 million at June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in total deposits of $72.6 million that consisted of roughly $46.2 million related to SBA PPP loans funded, or 18.7%, to $460.8 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $388.2 million at June 30, 2019, an increase in other borrowings of $1.9 million, or 411.1%, from $450,000 at June 30, 2019 to $2.3 million at June 30, 2020, and an increase of $1.4 million, or 92.1%, in other liabilities from $1.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $3.0 million at June 30, 2020, partially offset by a decrease of $295,000, or 21.8%, in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank from $1.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $1.1 million at June 30, 2020 and a decrease of $62,000, or 10.6%, in advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance from $584,000 at June 30, 2019 to $522,000 at June 30, 2020. The increase in deposits was primarily due to a $44.2 million, or 111.8%, increase in savings deposits from $39.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $83.8 million at June 30, 2020, a $44.0 million, or 74.3%, increase in non-interest bearing deposits from $59.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $103.4 million at June 30, 2020, and a $10.3 million, or 33.2%, increase in NOW accounts from $31.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $41.4 million at June 30, 2020, partially offset by a decrease of $25.7 million, or 14.0%, in certificates of deposit from $183.3 million at June 30, 2019 to $157.6 million at June 30, 2020, and a decrease in money market deposits of $297,000, or 0.4%, from $74.9 million at June 30, 2019 to $74.6 million at June 30, 2020. The Company had $16.1 million in brokered deposits at June 30, 2020 compared to $11.2 million at June 30, 2019. The decrease in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank was primarily principal payments on amortizing advances.\nShareholders' equity increased $193,000, or 0.4%, to $50.5 million at June 30, 2020 from $50.3 million at June 30, 2019. The primary reasons for the changes in shareholders' equity from June 30, 2019 were net income of $3.9 million, the vesting of restricted stock awards, stock options, and the release of employee stock ownership plan shares totaling $667,000, an increase in the Company's accumulated other comprehensive income of $895,000, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options of $65,000, partially offset by the acquisition of Company stock of $4.1 million and dividends paid totaling $1.1 million.\nAverage Balances, Net Interest Income Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Tax-exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. All average balances are based on monthly balances. Management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June 30,\n</td> <td> </td>

2019\nGeneral. The decrease in net income for the year ended June 30, 2020 resulted primarily from an increase of $1.3 million, or 11.8%, in non-interest expense, a $1.3 million, or 215.2%, increase in the provision for loan losses, and a decrease of $132,000, or 0.9% in net interest income, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million, or 63.5%, in non-interest income and a $326,000, or 25.4%, decrease in the provision for income taxes. The decrease in net interest income for the year was due to a $622,000, or 13.7%, increase in interest expense on borrowings and deposits, partially offset by a $490,000, or 2.5%, increase in total interest income. The Company's average interest rate spread was 3.13% for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.49% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The Company's net interest margin was 3.46% for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.78% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in the average interest rate spread and net interest margin was attributable primarily to a decrease of 26 basis points in average rate on interest earning assets for the year, from 4.90% at June 30, 2019 to 4.64% at June 30, 2020.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income amounted to $15.2 million for fiscal year 2020, a decrease of $132,000, or 0.9%, compared to $15.3 million for fiscal year 2019. The decrease was due primarily to an increase of $622,000 in interest expense, partially offset by a $490,000 increase in total interest income.\nThe average interest rate spread decreased from 3.49% for fiscal 2019 to 3.13% for fiscal 2020, while the average balance of interest-earning assets increased from $404.6 million to $438.7 million\nduring the same periods. The percentage of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 128.57% for fiscal 2020 compared to 125.65% for fiscal 2019. The decrease in the average interest rate spread and net interest margin was attributable primarily to a decrease of 26 basis points in average rate on interest earning assets for the year, from 4.90% at June 30, 2019 to 4.64% at June 30, 2020. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased from 1.82% for fiscal 2019 to 2.05% for fiscal 2020. Net interest margin decreased to 3.46% for fiscal 2020 compared to 3.78% for fiscal 2019.\nInterest income increased $490,000, or 2.5%, to $20.3 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $19.8 million for fiscal 2019, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of $377,000 for fiscal 2020 compared to 2019. The aggregate interest income from investment and mortgage-backed securities increased $151,000 for the same period. The increase in the average balance of loans receivable was primarily due to new loans originated by our commercial lending division. The average yield of the loan portfolio decreased by 10 basis points during fiscal 2020 mainly due to a lower interest rate environment.\nInterest expense increased $622,000, or 13.7%, to $5.2 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $4.5 million for fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. Interest paid on deposits increased during fiscal 2020.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings as losses are estimated to have occurred in our loan portfolio. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information or events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is impaired, the measurement of such impairment is based upon the fair value of the collateral of the loan. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we will recognize the impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge against earnings.\nAn allowance is also established for uncollectible interest on loans classified as substandard. The allowance is established by a charge to interest income equal to all interest previously accrued, and income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received. When, in management's judgment, the borrower's ability to make interest and principal payments is back to normal, the loan is returned to accrual status.\nA provision of $1.9 million was made to the allowance during fiscal 2020, compared to a provision of $600,000 in fiscal 2019. At June 30, 2020, the Company had $7.2 million of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, and other real estate owned) compared to $5.1 million of non-performing assets at June 30, 2019, consisting of two commercial business loans, three commercial real estate loans, eight single-family residential loans, one lot loan, one land loan, and two commercial real estate loans in other real estate owned at June 30, 2020, compared to five single-family residential loans, two line of credit loans, two commercial business loans, one lot loan, one land loan, one residential lot in other real estate owned, and two properties that secured single-family residential loans in other real estate owned at June 30, 2019. The increase in non-performing assets from $5.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $7.2 million at June 30, 2020 was primarily due to a $2.3 million borrower relationship, consisting of six loans to one borrower which include three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan that were placed on non-accrual status. The six loans had previously been paying interest only payments and were classified as troubled debt restructurings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2020, the Company had four single family residential loans, two commercial land and lot development loans, and six loans to one borrower consisting of three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan classified as substandard compared to four single family residential loans, one line of credit loan, two commercial business loans, two commercial land and lot development loans, and six loans to one borrower consisting of three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan classified as substandard at June 30, 2019. There were no loans classified as doubtful at June 30, 2020 or June 30, 2019.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income amounted to $3.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $1.5 million, or 63.5%, compared to non-interest income of $2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $1.5 million increase in non-interest income for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to an increase of $925,000 in gain on sale of loans, combined with decreases of $345,000 in loss on sale of real estate, an increase of $219,000 in gain on sale of securities and a $44,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $18,000 in other income, and a decrease of $1,000 on income from bank owned life insurance.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $1.3 million, or 11.8%, in fiscal 2020 due to increases of $1.2 million in compensation and benefits expense, $168,000 in occupancy and equipment expense, $67,000 in franchise and bank shares tax expense, $41,000 in data processing expense, and $27,000 in loan and collection expense. Non-interest expense increases were partially offset by decreases of $72,000 in advertising expense, $57,000 in audit and examination fees, $49,000 in legal fees, $39,000 in deposit insurance premiums, and $20,000 in other non-interest expense.\nProvision for Income Tax Expense. The provision for income taxes amounted to $957,000 and $1.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 19.9% for fiscal 2020 and 21.3% for fiscal 2019.\nExposure to Changes in Interest Rates\nOur ability to maintain net interest income depends upon our ability to earn a higher yield on interest-earning assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings. Our interest-earning assets consist primarily of securities available-for-sale and long-term residential and commercial mortgage loans, which have fixed rates of interest. Consequently, our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings can be adversely affected when market rates of interest rise.\nAlthough long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans made up a significant portion of our interest-earning assets at June 30, 2020, we sold a substantial amount of our one-to-four family residential loans we originated and maintained a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities during the past few years in order to better position the Company for a rising interest rate environment in the long term. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, securities available-for-sale amounted to $42.0 million and $41.7 million, respectively, or 8.1% and 9.4%, respectively, of total assets at such dates.\nQuantitative Analysis. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency provides a quarterly report on the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of portfolio equity. Management reviews the quarterly reports from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which show the impact of changing interest rates on net portfolio value. Net portfolio value is the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts.\nNet Portfolio Value. Our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in our net portfolio value ( NPV\u201d) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of June 30, 2020:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> Change in Interest Rates in\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nNet Portfolio Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> NPV as % of Portfolio\nValue of Assets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBasis Points (Rate Shock)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nNPV Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,355\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.76\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54,698\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.09\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.00\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.39\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 56,974\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,227\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.07\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.29\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.68\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>Static\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54,747\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.61\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (100)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,825\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (922\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.68\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.24\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.37\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (200)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,623\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.05\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.02\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.59\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQualitative Analysis. Our ability to maintain a positive spread\u201d between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is affected by changes in interest rates. Our fixed-rate loans generally are profitable, if interest rates are stable or declining since these loans have yields that exceed our cost of funds. If interest rates increase, however, we would have to pay more on our deposits and new borrowings, which would adversely affect our interest rate spread. In order to counter the potential effects of dramatic increases in market rates of interest, we have underwritten our mortgage loans to allow for their sale in the secondary market. Total loan originations amounted to $311.4 million for fiscal 2020 and $232.9 million for fiscal 2019, while loans sold amounted to $111.8 million and $62.2 million during the same respective periods. We have invested excess funds from loan payments and prepayments and loan sales in investment securities classified as available-for-sale. As a result, Home Federal Bancorp is not as susceptible to rising interest rates as it would be if its interest-earning assets were primarily comprised of long-term fixed rate mortgage loans. With respect to its floating or adjustable rate loans, Home Federal Bancorp writes interest rate floors and caps into such loan documents. Interest rate floors limit our interest rate risk by limiting potential decreases in the interest yield on an adjustable rate loan to a certain level. As a result, we receive a minimum yield even if rates decline farther, and the interest rate on the particular loan would otherwise adjust to a lower amount. Conversely, interest rate ceilings limit the amount by which the yield on an adjustable rate loan may increase to no more than six percentage points over the rate at the time of origination. Finally, we intend to place a greater emphasis on shorter-term consumer loans and commercial business loans in the future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHome Federal Bancorp maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. Our liquidity ratio averaged 24.97% for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, loan sales and earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning accounts and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Our deposit accounts with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas amounted to $19.1 million and $5.9 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nA significant portion of our liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have borrowing agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which provide an additional source of funds. At June 30, 2020, we had $1.1 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and had $161.7 million in additional borrowing capacity. Additionally, at June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank was a party to a Master Purchase Agreement with First National Bankers Bank, whereby Home Federal Bank may purchase Federal Funds from First National Bankers Bank in an amount not to exceed $19.5 million. There were no amounts purchased under this agreement as of June 30, 2020. In addition, Home Federal Bancorp had available a $5.0 million line of credit agreement at June 30, 2020 with First National Bankers Bank. At June 30, 2020 there was a $2.3 million balance in the credit line.\nAt June 30, 2020, the Company had outstanding loan commitments of $53.1 million to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit of $8.5 million. At June 30, 2020, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled $88.0 million, or 55.9% of total certificates of deposit. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In addition, the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher upon renewal in a rising interest rate environment. We intend to utilize our high levels of liquidity to fund our lending activities. If additional funds are required to fund lending activities, we intend to sell our securities classified as available-for-sale, as needed.\nAt June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with tangible equity, common equity Tier 1, core, and total risk-based capital ratios of 10.21%, 16.37%, 10.21%, and 17.63%, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and have not had any such arrangements during the two years ended June 30, 2020. See Notes 9 and 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein regarding Home Federal Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on Home Federal Bancorp's performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates.\nAdditional COVID-19 Information\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 did not have a material impact on the financial results of the Company as of June 30, 2020. For the health of our customers and employees, the Bank closed lobbies to all seven branch offices and our main office through June 15, 2020 but remained fully operational. As an essential business, we continued to provide banking and financial services to our customers with drive-thru access available at all of our branch locations and in-person services available by appointment. In addition, we continued to provide access to banking and financial services through online banking, ATMs and by telephone.\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act was passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided an estimated $2.2 trillion of economy-wide financial stimulus to combat the pandemic and stimulate the economy in the form of financial aid to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, states, and municipalities through loans, grants, tax changes, and other types of relief.\nThe following describes some of our responses to COVID-19 relative to the CARES Act, and other effects of the pandemic on our business.\nPaycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act authorized the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d). We took action promptly to qualify as an SBA lender and were authorized to originate PPP loans.\nThrough June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank has funded 374 PPP loans with total principal balances of $46.2 million to existing customers and key prospects located primarily in our trade area of NW Louisiana.\nLoan Modifications/Troubled Debt Restructurings. Under the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then suspend the requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Financial institutions wishing to utilize this authority must make a policy election, which applies to any COVID-19 modification made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of either December 31, 2020 or the 60th day after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency. Home Federal Bank has made that election. Similarly, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has confirmed that short-term modifications made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to loan customers who were current prior to any relief will not be considered TDRs.\nPrior to the enactment of the CARES Act, the banking regulatory agencies provided guidance as to how certain short-term modifications would not be considered TDRs, and have subsequently confirmed that such guidance could be applicable for loans that do not qualify for favorable accounting treatment under Section 4013 of the CARES Act.\nThe Bank handles loan payment modification requests on a case-by-case basis considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, related economic slow-down and stay-at-home orders on our customer and their current and projected cash flows through the term of the loan. Through June 30, 2020, we modified 216 loans with principal balances totaling $84.1 million representing 23.0% of our loans outstanding as of June 30, 2020. A majority of deferrals are three-month payment deferrals of principal and interest, with payments after deferral increased to collect amounts deferred. It is too early to determine if these modified loans will perform in accordance with their modified terms.\nDetails with respect to actual loan modifications are as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nNumber of Covid-19 Deferments June 30, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nBalance\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nPercent of Total Loans at June 30, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One-to-Four Family Residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,705\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 28,278\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-family residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,046\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,190\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity and Second Mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,586\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,609\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,094\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder). Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the beliefs, expectations or opinions of Home Federal Bancorp and its management regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as: believe\u201d, expect\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, plan\u201d, estimate\u201d, or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional terms such as will\u201d, would\u201d, should\u201d, could\u201d, may\u201d, likely\u201d, probably\u201d, or possibly.\u201d Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions; statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services; and statements regarding future performance. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumption, many of which are difficult to predict and generally are beyond the control of Home Federal Bancorp and its management, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: (1) economic and competitive conditions which could affect the volume of loan originations, deposit flows and real estate values; (2) the levels of non-interest income and expense and the amount of loan losses; (3) competitive pressure among depository institutions increasing significantly; (4) changes in the interest rate environment causing reduced interest margins; (5) general economic conditions, either nationally or in the markets in which Home Federal Bancorp is or will be doing business, being less favorable than expected (6) political and social unrest including acts of war or terrorism; (7) the impact of the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) or (8) legislation or changes in regulatory requirements adversely affecting the business in which Home Federal Bancorp will be engaged. Home Federal Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOur profitability depends primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets, principally loans, investment securities, and interest-earning deposits in other institutions, and interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. Net interest income is dependent upon the level of interest rates and the extent to which such rates are changing. Our profitability also depends, to a lesser extent, on non-interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest expenses, and federal income taxes. Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana had net income of $3.9 million in fiscal 2020 compared to net income of $4.7 million in fiscal 2019.\nOur business consists primarily of originating single-family real estate loans secured by property in our market area and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, and real estate secured lines of credit which typically have higher rates and shorter terms than single-family loans. Although our loans are primarily funded by certificates of deposit, which typically have a higher interest rate than passbook accounts, it is our policy to require commercial customers to have a deposit relationship with us, which primarily consist of NOW accounts. Due to the continued low interest rate environment, we have sold a substantial amount of our fixed rate single-family residential loan originations in recent periods. We have also sold investment securities available-for-sale to realize gains in the portfolio. Because of an increase in our average cost of funds on our interest bearing liabilities, our net interest margin decreased from 3.78% to 3.46% during fiscal 2020 compared to 2019, and our net interest income decreased $132,000 to $15.2 million for fiscal 2020 as compared to $15.3 million for fiscal 2019. We expect to continue to emphasize consumer and commercial lending in the future in order to improve the yield on our portfolio.\nHome Federal Bancorp's operations and profitability are subject to changes in interest rates, applicable statutes and regulations, and general economic conditions, as well as other factors beyond our control.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is focused on operating a growing and profitable community-oriented financial institution. Our current business strategy includes:\n \u2022 Continuing to Grow and Diversify Our Loan Portfolio. We intend to grow and continue to diversify of loan portfolio by, among other things, emphasizing the origination of commercial real estate and business loans. At June 30, 2020, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $87.1 million, or 23.83% of the total loan portfolio. Our commercial business loans amounted to $81.9 million, or 22.41% of the total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and development, and consumer loans all typically have higher yields and are more interest sensitive than long-term single-family residential mortgage loans. \n \u2022 Diversify Our Products and Services. We intend to continue to emphasize our commercial business products to provide a full-service banking relationship to our commercial customers. We have introduced mobile and Internet banking and remote deposit capture, to better serve our commercial clients. Additionally, we have developed new deposit products focused on expanding our deposit base to new types of customers. \n \u2022 Managing Our Expenses. We have incurred significant additional expenses related to personnel and infrastructure in recent periods as we implemented our business strategy. Our efficiency ratio, net interest income plus non-interest income divided by non-interest expense, for 2020 was 64.9% compared to 62.6% for fiscal 2019. \n \u2022 Enhancing Core Earnings. We expect to continue to emphasize commercial real estate and business loans, which generally bear interest rates higher than residential real estate loans, and sell a substantial part of our fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations. \n \u2022 Expanding Our Franchise in our Market Area and Contiguous Communities. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to expand our market area by opening additional de novo banking offices and possibly through acquisitions of other financial institutions and banking related businesses. We expect to focus on contiguous areas to our current locations in Caddo and Bossier Parishes. \n \u2022 Maintain Our Asset Quality. At June 30, 2020, our non-performing assets totaled $7.2 million, or 1.39% of total assets. We had other real estate owned consisting of two commercial real estate properties with a carrying value of $950,000 at June 30, 2020. We intend to continue to stress maintaining high asset quality, even as we continue to grow our institution and diversify our loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Cross-Selling Products and Services and Emphasizing Local Decision Making. We have promoted cross-selling products and services in our branch offices and emphasized our local decision making and streamlined loan approval process. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn reviewing and understanding financial information for Home Federal Bancorp, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. We have identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy where amounts are sensitive to material variation. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate for probable losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio but which have not yet been realized as of the date of our consolidated balance sheet. It is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that management believes will cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans, and current economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, exposure at default, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios, and general amounts for historical loss experience. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant changes as more information becomes available.\nWhile management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance. Historically, our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management's initial estimates. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as an integral part of their examination processes periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. Realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income. We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors. We may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change.\nCOVID-19\nIn light of the recent events surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic, the Company is continually assessing the effects of the pandemic on its employees, customers and communities. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted. The CARES Act contains many provisions related to banking, lending, mortgage forbearance and taxation. The Company has been working diligently to help support its customers through the SBA Paycheck Protection Program ( SBA PPP\u201d), loan modifications and loan deferrals. As of June 30, 2020 Home Federal Bank has funded 374 SBA PPP loans totaling approximately $46.2 million with an average loan balance of $124,000 to existing customers and key prospects located primarily in our trade area of NW Louisiana. Our commercial lenders and operational support staff have worked tirelessly over the past few weeks to accomplish what seemed to be an insurmountable task in providing a lifeline to our small community businesses. We believe the customer interaction during this time provides a real opportunity to broaden and deepen our customer relationships while benefiting our community.\nHome Federal Bank is working with customers affected by COVID-19 through payment accommodations on their loans. In accordance with FDIC guidance, borrowers who were current prior to becoming affected by COVID-19, that received payment accommodations as a result of the pandemic, generally are not reported as past due. Effects of COVID-19 may negatively impact management assumptions and estimates, such as the allowance for loan losses. The Bank is evaluating all payment accommodations to customers to identify and quantify any impact they may have on the Bank. However, it is difficult to assess or predict how and to what extent COVID-19 will affect the Company in the future. Please see the section titled Additional COVID-19 Information\u201d for additional information related to actions taken.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nAt June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bancorp reported total assets of $518.2 million, an increase of $75.8 million, or 17.1%, compared to total assets of $442.5 million at June 30, 2019. The increase in assets was comprised primarily of increases in cash and cash equivalents of $36.8 million, or 203.0%, from $18.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $54.9 million at June 30, 2020, loans receivable net of $35.8 million, or 11.0%, from $324.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $359.9 million at June 30, 2020, loans held-for-sale of $6.2 million, or 71.9%, from $8.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $14.8 million at June 30, 2020, accrued interest receivable of $688,000, or 58.7%, from $1.2 million at June 30, 2019 to $1.9 million at June 30, 2020, and premises and equipment of $558,000, or 4.1%, from $13.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $14.1 million at June 30, 2020. These increases were partially offset by decreases in investment securities of $4.1 million, or 6.1%, from $67.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $62.9 million at June 30, 2020, real estate owned of $416,000, or 30.5%, from $1.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $950,000 at June 30, 2020, and deferred tax assets of $92,000, or 10.8%, from $849,000 at June 30, 2019 to $757,000 at June 30, 2020. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to deposits associated with SBA PPP loans. The decrease in investment securities was primarily due to $17.0 million of principal repayments on mortgage backed securities and $9.9 million from the sale of mortgage backed securities, partially offset by the purchases of $21.2 million of mortgage-backed securities, a purchase of one municipal bond for $245,000, and an increase of $1.1 million in the market value adjustments on available for sale securities. The increase in loans held-for-sale resulted primarily from an increase in loans originated for sale during the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in real estate owned was due to the sale of four one-to-four family residences and one residential lot during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nLoans receivable, net increased $35.8 million, or 11.0%, from $324.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $359.9 million at June 30, 2020. The increase in loans receivable, net was attributable primarily to increases in commercial business loans of $45.9 million, commercial real estate loans of $3.7 million, land loans of $2.0 million, multi-family residential loans of $1.3 million, consumer loans of $211,000 and equity and second mortgage loans of $148,000, partially offset by decreases in one-to-four-family residential of $10.8 million, equity lines of credit of $3.4 million and construction loans of $1.3 million at June 30, 2020, compared to the prior year. At June 30, 2020, the balance of purchased loans approximated $2.9 million, which consisted solely of one-to-four family residential loans purchased from a mortgage originator headquartered in Arkansas. We have not purchased any loans since fiscal 2008. In recent years, there have been significant loan prepayments due to the heavy volume of loan refinancing, however, the rate of prepayments has been slowing. With interest rates continuing at historical lows, management is reluctant to invest in long-term, fixed rate mortgage loans for the portfolio and instead sells the majority of the long-term, fixed rate mortgage loan production.\nIn recent periods we diversified the loan products we offer and increased our efforts to originate higher yielding commercial real estate loans and lines of credit and commercial business loans which were deemed attractive due to their generally higher yields and shorter anticipated lives compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank had $87.1 million of commercial real estate loans, 23.83% of the total loan portfolio, and $81.9 million of commercial business loans, 22.41% of the total loan portfolio. Although commercial loans are generally considered to have greater credit risk than other certain types of loans, we attempt to mitigate such risk by originating such loans in our market area to known borrowers.\nSecurities available-for-sale increased $405,000, or 1.0%, from $41.7 million at June 30, 2019 to $42.1 million at June 30, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from purchases of $21.2 million in mortgage-backed securities and increases in market values of securities of $1.1 million, partially offset by principal repayments of $12.3 million and sales of $9.6 million.\nSecurities held-to-maturity decreased $4.5 million, from $25.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $20.9 million at June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to normal principal pay downs on these securities. We chose to place these securities in held-to-maturity as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $36.8 million, or 203.0%, from $18.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $54.9 million at June 30, 2020. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to increases in total deposits related to SBA PPP loans funded.\nTotal liabilities increased $75.6 million, or 19.3%, from $392.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $467.7 million at June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in total deposits of $72.6 million that consisted of roughly $46.2 million related to SBA PPP loans funded, or 18.7%, to $460.8 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $388.2 million at June 30, 2019, an increase in other borrowings of $1.9 million, or 411.1%, from $450,000 at June 30, 2019 to $2.3 million at June 30, 2020, and an increase of $1.4 million, or 92.1%, in other liabilities from $1.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $3.0 million at June 30, 2020, partially offset by a decrease of $295,000, or 21.8%, in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank from $1.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $1.1 million at June 30, 2020 and a decrease of $62,000, or 10.6%, in advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance from $584,000 at June 30, 2019 to $522,000 at June 30, 2020. The increase in deposits was primarily due to a $44.2 million, or 111.8%, increase in savings deposits from $39.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $83.8 million at June 30, 2020, a $44.0 million, or 74.3%, increase in non-interest bearing deposits from $59.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $103.4 million at June 30, 2020, and a $10.3 million, or 33.2%, increase in NOW accounts from $31.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $41.4 million at June 30, 2020, partially offset by a decrease of $25.7 million, or 14.0%, in certificates of deposit from $183.3 million at June 30, 2019 to $157.6 million at June 30, 2020, and a decrease in money market deposits of $297,000, or 0.4%, from $74.9 million at June 30, 2019 to $74.6 million at June 30, 2020. The Company had $16.1 million in brokered deposits at June 30, 2020 compared to $11.2 million at June 30, 2019. The decrease in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank was primarily principal payments on amortizing advances.\nShareholders' equity increased $193,000, or 0.4%, to $50.5 million at June 30, 2020 from $50.3 million at June 30, 2019. The primary reasons for the changes in shareholders' equity from June 30, 2019 were net income of $3.9 million, the vesting of restricted stock awards, stock options, and the release of employee stock ownership plan shares totaling $667,000, an increase in the Company's accumulated other comprehensive income of $895,000, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options of $65,000, partially offset by the acquisition of Company stock of $4.1 million and dividends paid totaling $1.1 million.\nAverage Balances, Net Interest Income Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Tax-exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. All average balances are based on monthly balances. Management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June 30,\n</td> <td> </td>

For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by current year volume), and (iii) total change in rate and volume. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2019\nGeneral. The decrease in net income for the year ended June 30, 2020 resulted primarily from an increase of $1.3 million, or 11.8%, in non-interest expense, a $1.3 million, or 215.2%, increase in the provision for loan losses, and a decrease of $132,000, or 0.9% in net interest income, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million, or 63.5%, in non-interest income and a $326,000, or 25.4%, decrease in the provision for income taxes. The decrease in net interest income for the year was due to a $622,000, or 13.7%, increase in interest expense on borrowings and deposits, partially offset by a $490,000, or 2.5%, increase in total interest income. The Company's average interest rate spread was 3.13% for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.49% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The Company's net interest margin was 3.46% for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.78% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in the average interest rate spread and net interest margin was attributable primarily to a decrease of 26 basis points in average rate on interest earning assets for the year, from 4.90% at June 30, 2019 to 4.64% at June 30, 2020.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income amounted to $15.2 million for fiscal year 2020, a decrease of $132,000, or 0.9%, compared to $15.3 million for fiscal year 2019. The decrease was due primarily to an increase of $622,000 in interest expense, partially offset by a $490,000 increase in total interest income.\nThe average interest rate spread decreased from 3.49% for fiscal 2019 to 3.13% for fiscal 2020, while the average balance of interest-earning assets increased from $404.6 million to $438.7 million\nduring the same periods. The percentage of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 128.57% for fiscal 2020 compared to 125.65% for fiscal 2019. The decrease in the average interest rate spread and net interest margin was attributable primarily to a decrease of 26 basis points in average rate on interest earning assets for the year, from 4.90% at June 30, 2019 to 4.64% at June 30, 2020. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased from 1.82% for fiscal 2019 to 2.05% for fiscal 2020. Net interest margin decreased to 3.46% for fiscal 2020 compared to 3.78% for fiscal 2019.\nInterest income increased $490,000, or 2.5%, to $20.3 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $19.8 million for fiscal 2019, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of $377,000 for fiscal 2020 compared to 2019. The aggregate interest income from investment and mortgage-backed securities increased $151,000 for the same period. The increase in the average balance of loans receivable was primarily due to new loans originated by our commercial lending division. The average yield of the loan portfolio decreased by 10 basis points during fiscal 2020 mainly due to a lower interest rate environment.\nInterest expense increased $622,000, or 13.7%, to $5.2 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $4.5 million for fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. Interest paid on deposits increased during fiscal 2020.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings as losses are estimated to have occurred in our loan portfolio. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information or events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is impaired, the measurement of such impairment is based upon the fair value of the collateral of the loan. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we will recognize the impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge against earnings.\nAn allowance is also established for uncollectible interest on loans classified as substandard. The allowance is established by a charge to interest income equal to all interest previously accrued, and income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received. When, in management's judgment, the borrower's ability to make interest and principal payments is back to normal, the loan is returned to accrual status.\nA provision of $1.9 million was made to the allowance during fiscal 2020, compared to a provision of $600,000 in fiscal 2019. At June 30, 2020, the Company had $7.2 million of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, and other real estate owned) compared to $5.1 million of non-performing assets at June 30, 2019, consisting of two commercial business loans, three commercial real estate loans, eight single-family residential loans, one lot loan, one land loan, and two commercial real estate loans in other real estate owned at June 30, 2020, compared to five single-family residential loans, two line of credit loans, two commercial business loans, one lot loan, one land loan, one residential lot in other real estate owned, and two properties that secured single-family residential loans in other real estate owned at June 30, 2019. The increase in non-performing assets from $5.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $7.2 million at June 30, 2020 was primarily due to a $2.3 million borrower relationship, consisting of six loans to one borrower which include three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan that were placed on non-accrual status. The six loans had previously been paying interest only payments and were classified as troubled debt restructurings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2020, the Company had four single family residential loans, two commercial land and lot development loans, and six loans to one borrower consisting of three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan classified as substandard compared to four single family residential loans, one line of credit loan, two commercial business loans, two commercial land and lot development loans, and six loans to one borrower consisting of three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan classified as substandard at June 30, 2019. There were no loans classified as doubtful at June 30, 2020 or June 30, 2019.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income amounted to $3.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $1.5 million, or 63.5%, compared to non-interest income of $2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $1.5 million increase in non-interest income for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to an increase of $925,000 in gain on sale of loans, combined with decreases of $345,000 in loss on sale of real estate, an increase of $219,000 in gain on sale of securities and a $44,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $18,000 in other income, and a decrease of $1,000 on income from bank owned life insurance.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $1.3 million, or 11.8%, in fiscal 2020 due to increases of $1.2 million in compensation and benefits expense, $168,000 in occupancy and equipment expense, $67,000 in franchise and bank shares tax expense, $41,000 in data processing expense, and $27,000 in loan and collection expense. Non-interest expense increases were partially offset by decreases of $72,000 in advertising expense, $57,000 in audit and examination fees, $49,000 in legal fees, $39,000 in deposit insurance premiums, and $20,000 in other non-interest expense.\nProvision for Income Tax Expense. The provision for income taxes amounted to $957,000 and $1.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 19.9% for fiscal 2020 and 21.3% for fiscal 2019.\nExposure to Changes in Interest Rates\nOur ability to maintain net interest income depends upon our ability to earn a higher yield on interest-earning assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings. Our interest-earning assets consist primarily of securities available-for-sale and long-term residential and commercial mortgage loans, which have fixed rates of interest. Consequently, our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings can be adversely affected when market rates of interest rise.\nAlthough long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans made up a significant portion of our interest-earning assets at June 30, 2020, we sold a substantial amount of our one-to-four family residential loans we originated and maintained a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities during the past few years in order to better position the Company for a rising interest rate environment in the long term. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, securities available-for-sale amounted to $42.0 million and $41.7 million, respectively, or 8.1% and 9.4%, respectively, of total assets at such dates.\nQuantitative Analysis. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency provides a quarterly report on the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of portfolio equity. Management reviews the quarterly reports from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which show the impact of changing interest rates on net portfolio value. Net portfolio value is the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts.\nNet Portfolio Value. Our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in our net portfolio value ( NPV\u201d) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of June 30, 2020:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> Change in Interest Rates in\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nNet Portfolio Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> NPV as % of Portfolio\nValue of Assets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBasis Points (Rate Shock)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nNPV Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,355\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.76\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54,698\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.09\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.00\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.39\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 56,974\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,227\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.07\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.29\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.68\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>Static\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54,747\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.61\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (100)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,825\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (922\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.68\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.24\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.37\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (200)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,623\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.05\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.02\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.59\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQualitative Analysis. Our ability to maintain a positive spread\u201d between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is affected by changes in interest rates. Our fixed-rate loans generally are profitable, if interest rates are stable or declining since these loans have yields that exceed our cost of funds. If interest rates increase, however, we would have to pay more on our deposits and new borrowings, which would adversely affect our interest rate spread. In order to counter the potential effects of dramatic increases in market rates of interest, we have underwritten our mortgage loans to allow for their sale in the secondary market. Total loan originations amounted to $311.4 million for fiscal 2020 and $232.9 million for fiscal 2019, while loans sold amounted to $111.8 million and $62.2 million during the same respective periods. We have invested excess funds from loan payments and prepayments and loan sales in investment securities classified as available-for-sale. As a result, Home Federal Bancorp is not as susceptible to rising interest rates as it would be if its interest-earning assets were primarily comprised of long-term fixed rate mortgage loans. With respect to its floating or adjustable rate loans, Home Federal Bancorp writes interest rate floors and caps into such loan documents. Interest rate floors limit our interest rate risk by limiting potential decreases in the interest yield on an adjustable rate loan to a certain level. As a result, we receive a minimum yield even if rates decline farther, and the interest rate on the particular loan would otherwise adjust to a lower amount. Conversely, interest rate ceilings limit the amount by which the yield on an adjustable rate loan may increase to no more than six percentage points over the rate at the time of origination. Finally, we intend to place a greater emphasis on shorter-term consumer loans and commercial business loans in the future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHome Federal Bancorp maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. Our liquidity ratio averaged 24.97% for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, loan sales and earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning accounts and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Our deposit accounts with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas amounted to $19.1 million and $5.9 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nA significant portion of our liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have borrowing agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which provide an additional source of funds. At June 30, 2020, we had $1.1 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and had $161.7 million in additional borrowing capacity. Additionally, at June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank was a party to a Master Purchase Agreement with First National Bankers Bank, whereby Home Federal Bank may purchase Federal Funds from First National Bankers Bank in an amount not to exceed $19.5 million. There were no amounts purchased under this agreement as of June 30, 2020. In addition, Home Federal Bancorp had available a $5.0 million line of credit agreement at June 30, 2020 with First National Bankers Bank. At June 30, 2020 there was a $2.3 million balance in the credit line.\nAt June 30, 2020, the Company had outstanding loan commitments of $53.1 million to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit of $8.5 million. At June 30, 2020, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled $88.0 million, or 55.9% of total certificates of deposit. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In addition, the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher upon renewal in a rising interest rate environment. We intend to utilize our high levels of liquidity to fund our lending activities. If additional funds are required to fund lending activities, we intend to sell our securities classified as available-for-sale, as needed.\nAt June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with tangible equity, common equity Tier 1, core, and total risk-based capital ratios of 10.21%, 16.37%, 10.21%, and 17.63%, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and have not had any such arrangements during the two years ended June 30, 2020. See Notes 9 and 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein regarding Home Federal Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on Home Federal Bancorp's performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates.\nAdditional COVID-19 Information\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 did not have a material impact on the financial results of the Company as of June 30, 2020. For the health of our customers and employees, the Bank closed lobbies to all seven branch offices and our main office through June 15, 2020 but remained fully operational. As an essential business, we continued to provide banking and financial services to our customers with drive-thru access available at all of our branch locations and in-person services available by appointment. In addition, we continued to provide access to banking and financial services through online banking, ATMs and by telephone.\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act was passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided an estimated $2.2 trillion of economy-wide financial stimulus to combat the pandemic and stimulate the economy in the form of financial aid to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, states, and municipalities through loans, grants, tax changes, and other types of relief.\nThe following describes some of our responses to COVID-19 relative to the CARES Act, and other effects of the pandemic on our business.\nPaycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act authorized the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d). We took action promptly to qualify as an SBA lender and were authorized to originate PPP loans.\nThrough June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank has funded 374 PPP loans with total principal balances of $46.2 million to existing customers and key prospects located primarily in our trade area of NW Louisiana.\nLoan Modifications/Troubled Debt Restructurings. Under the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then suspend the requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Financial institutions wishing to utilize this authority must make a policy election, which applies to any COVID-19 modification made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of either December 31, 2020 or the 60th day after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency. Home Federal Bank has made that election. Similarly, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has confirmed that short-term modifications made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to loan customers who were current prior to any relief will not be considered TDRs.\nPrior to the enactment of the CARES Act, the banking regulatory agencies provided guidance as to how certain short-term modifications would not be considered TDRs, and have subsequently confirmed that such guidance could be applicable for loans that do not qualify for favorable accounting treatment under Section 4013 of the CARES Act.\nThe Bank handles loan payment modification requests on a case-by-case basis considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, related economic slow-down and stay-at-home orders on our customer and their current and projected cash flows through the term of the loan. Through June 30, 2020, we modified 216 loans with principal balances totaling $84.1 million representing 23.0% of our loans outstanding as of June 30, 2020. A majority of deferrals are three-month payment deferrals of principal and interest, with payments after deferral increased to collect amounts deferred. It is too early to determine if these modified loans will perform in accordance with their modified terms.\nDetails with respect to actual loan modifications are as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nNumber of Covid-19 Deferments June 30, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nBalance\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nPercent of Total Loans at June 30, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One-to-Four Family Residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,705\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 28,278\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-family residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,046\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,190\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity and Second Mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,586\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,609\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> --\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,094\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder). Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the beliefs, expectations or opinions of Home Federal Bancorp and its management regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as: believe\u201d, expect\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, plan\u201d, estimate\u201d, or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional terms such as will\u201d, would\u201d, should\u201d, could\u201d, may\u201d, likely\u201d, probably\u201d, or possibly.\u201d Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions; statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services; and statements regarding future performance. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumption, many of which are difficult to predict and generally are beyond the control of Home Federal Bancorp and its management, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: (1) economic and competitive conditions which could affect the volume of loan originations, deposit flows and real estate values; (2) the levels of non-interest income and expense and the amount of loan losses; (3) competitive pressure among depository institutions increasing significantly; (4) changes in the interest rate environment causing reduced interest margins; (5) general economic conditions, either nationally or in the markets in which Home Federal Bancorp is or will be doing business, being less favorable than expected (6) political and social unrest including acts of war or terrorism; (7) the impact of the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) or (8) legislation or changes in regulatory requirements adversely affecting the business in which Home Federal Bancorp will be engaged. Home Federal Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOur profitability depends primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets, principally loans, investment securities, and interest-earning deposits in other institutions, and interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. Net interest income is dependent upon the level of interest rates and the extent to which such rates are changing. Our profitability also depends, to a lesser extent, on non-interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest expenses, and federal income taxes. Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana had net income of $3.9 million in fiscal 2020 compared to net income of $4.7 million in fiscal 2019.\nOur business consists primarily of originating single-family real estate loans secured by property in our market area and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, and real estate secured lines of credit which typically have higher rates and shorter terms than single-family loans. Although our loans are primarily funded by certificates of deposit, which typically have a higher interest rate than passbook accounts, it is our policy to require commercial customers to have a deposit relationship with us, which primarily consist of NOW accounts. Due to the continued low interest rate environment, we have sold a substantial amount of our fixed rate single-family residential loan originations in recent periods. We have also sold investment securities available-for-sale to realize gains in the portfolio. Because of an increase in our average cost of funds on our interest bearing liabilities, our net interest margin decreased from 3.78% to 3.46% during fiscal 2020 compared to 2019, and our net interest income decreased $132,000 to $15.2 million for fiscal 2020 as compared to $15.3 million for fiscal 2019. We expect to continue to emphasize consumer and commercial lending in the future in order to improve the yield on our portfolio.\nHome Federal Bancorp's operations and profitability are subject to changes in interest rates, applicable statutes and regulations, and general economic conditions, as well as other factors beyond our control.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is focused on operating a growing and profitable community-oriented financial institution. Our current business strategy includes:\n \u2022 Continuing to Grow and Diversify Our Loan Portfolio. We intend to grow and continue to diversify of loan portfolio by, among other things, emphasizing the origination of commercial real estate and business loans. At June 30, 2020, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $87.1 million, or 23.83% of the total loan portfolio. Our commercial business loans amounted to $81.9 million, or 22.41% of the total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and development, and consumer loans all typically have higher yields and are more interest sensitive than long-term single-family residential mortgage loans. \n \u2022 Diversify Our Products and Services. We intend to continue to emphasize our commercial business products to provide a full-service banking relationship to our commercial customers. We have introduced mobile and Internet banking and remote deposit capture, to better serve our commercial clients. Additionally, we have developed new deposit products focused on expanding our deposit base to new types of customers. \n \u2022 Managing Our Expenses. We have incurred significant additional expenses related to personnel and infrastructure in recent periods as we implemented our business strategy. Our efficiency ratio, net interest income plus non-interest income divided by non-interest expense, for 2020 was 64.9% compared to 62.6% for fiscal 2019. \n \u2022 Enhancing Core Earnings. We expect to continue to emphasize commercial real estate and business loans, which generally bear interest rates higher than residential real estate loans, and sell a substantial part of our fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations. \n \u2022 Expanding Our Franchise in our Market Area and Contiguous Communities. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to expand our market area by opening additional de novo banking offices and possibly through acquisitions of other financial institutions and banking related businesses. We expect to focus on contiguous areas to our current locations in Caddo and Bossier Parishes. \n \u2022 Maintain Our Asset Quality. At June 30, 2020, our non-performing assets totaled $7.2 million, or 1.39% of total assets. We had other real estate owned consisting of two commercial real estate properties with a carrying value of $950,000 at June 30, 2020. We intend to continue to stress maintaining high asset quality, even as we continue to grow our institution and diversify our loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Cross-Selling Products and Services and Emphasizing Local Decision Making. We have promoted cross-selling products and services in our branch offices and emphasized our local decision making and streamlined loan approval process. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn reviewing and understanding financial information for Home Federal Bancorp, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. We have identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy where amounts are sensitive to material variation. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate for probable losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio but which have not yet been realized as of the date of our consolidated balance sheet. It is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that management believes will cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans, and current economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, exposure at default, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios, and general amounts for historical loss experience. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant changes as more information becomes available.\nWhile management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance. Historically, our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management's initial estimates. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as an integral part of their examination processes periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. Realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income. We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors. We may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change.\nCOVID-19\nIn light of the recent events surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic, the Company is continually assessing the effects of the pandemic on its employees, customers and communities. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted. The CARES Act contains many provisions related to banking, lending, mortgage forbearance and taxation. The Company has been working diligently to help support its customers through the SBA Paycheck Protection Program ( SBA PPP\u201d), loan modifications and loan deferrals. As of June 30, 2020 Home Federal Bank has funded 374 SBA PPP loans totaling approximately $46.2 million with an average loan balance of $124,000 to existing customers and key prospects located primarily in our trade area of NW Louisiana. Our commercial lenders and operational support staff have worked tirelessly over the past few weeks to accomplish what seemed to be an insurmountable task in providing a lifeline to our small community businesses. We believe the customer interaction during this time provides a real opportunity to broaden and deepen our customer relationships while benefiting our community.\nHome Federal Bank is working with customers affected by COVID-19 through payment accommodations on their loans. In accordance with FDIC guidance, borrowers who were current prior to becoming affected by COVID-19, that received payment accommodations as a result of the pandemic, generally are not reported as past due. Effects of COVID-19 may negatively impact management assumptions and estimates, such as the allowance for loan losses. The Bank is evaluating all payment accommodations to customers to identify and quantify any impact they may have on the Bank. However, it is difficult to assess or predict how and to what extent COVID-19 will affect the Company in the future. Please see the section titled Additional COVID-19 Information\u201d for additional information related to actions taken.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nAt June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bancorp reported total assets of $518.2 million, an increase of $75.8 million, or 17.1%, compared to total assets of $442.5 million at June 30, 2019. The increase in assets was comprised primarily of increases in cash and cash equivalents of $36.8 million, or 203.0%, from $18.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $54.9 million at June 30, 2020, loans receivable net of $35.8 million, or 11.0%, from $324.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $359.9 million at June 30, 2020, loans held-for-sale of $6.2 million, or 71.9%, from $8.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $14.8 million at June 30, 2020, accrued interest receivable of $688,000, or 58.7%, from $1.2 million at June 30, 2019 to $1.9 million at June 30, 2020, and premises and equipment of $558,000, or 4.1%, from $13.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $14.1 million at June 30, 2020. These increases were partially offset by decreases in investment securities of $4.1 million, or 6.1%, from $67.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $62.9 million at June 30, 2020, real estate owned of $416,000, or 30.5%, from $1.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $950,000 at June 30, 2020, and deferred tax assets of $92,000, or 10.8%, from $849,000 at June 30, 2019 to $757,000 at June 30, 2020. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to deposits associated with SBA PPP loans. The decrease in investment securities was primarily due to $17.0 million of principal repayments on mortgage backed securities and $9.9 million from the sale of mortgage backed securities, partially offset by the purchases of $21.2 million of mortgage-backed securities, a purchase of one municipal bond for $245,000, and an increase of $1.1 million in the market value adjustments on available for sale securities. The increase in loans held-for-sale resulted primarily from an increase in loans originated for sale during the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in real estate owned was due to the sale of four one-to-four family residences and one residential lot during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nLoans receivable, net increased $35.8 million, or 11.0%, from $324.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $359.9 million at June 30, 2020. The increase in loans receivable, net was attributable primarily to increases in commercial business loans of $45.9 million, commercial real estate loans of $3.7 million, land loans of $2.0 million, multi-family residential loans of $1.3 million, consumer loans of $211,000 and equity and second mortgage loans of $148,000, partially offset by decreases in one-to-four-family residential of $10.8 million, equity lines of credit of $3.4 million and construction loans of $1.3 million at June 30, 2020, compared to the prior year. At June 30, 2020, the balance of purchased loans approximated $2.9 million, which consisted solely of one-to-four family residential loans purchased from a mortgage originator headquartered in Arkansas. We have not purchased any loans since fiscal 2008. In recent years, there have been significant loan prepayments due to the heavy volume of loan refinancing, however, the rate of prepayments has been slowing. With interest rates continuing at historical lows, management is reluctant to invest in long-term, fixed rate mortgage loans for the portfolio and instead sells the majority of the long-term, fixed rate mortgage loan production.\nIn recent periods we diversified the loan products we offer and increased our efforts to originate higher yielding commercial real estate loans and lines of credit and commercial business loans which were deemed attractive due to their generally higher yields and shorter anticipated lives compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank had $87.1 million of commercial real estate loans, 23.83% of the total loan portfolio, and $81.9 million of commercial business loans, 22.41% of the total loan portfolio. Although commercial loans are generally considered to have greater credit risk than other certain types of loans, we attempt to mitigate such risk by originating such loans in our market area to known borrowers.\nSecurities available-for-sale increased $405,000, or 1.0%, from $41.7 million at June 30, 2019 to $42.1 million at June 30, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from purchases of $21.2 million in mortgage-backed securities and increases in market values of securities of $1.1 million, partially offset by principal repayments of $12.3 million and sales of $9.6 million.\nSecurities held-to-maturity decreased $4.5 million, from $25.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $20.9 million at June 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to normal principal pay downs on these securities. We chose to place these securities in held-to-maturity as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $36.8 million, or 203.0%, from $18.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $54.9 million at June 30, 2020. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to increases in total deposits related to SBA PPP loans funded.\nTotal liabilities increased $75.6 million, or 19.3%, from $392.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $467.7 million at June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in total deposits of $72.6 million that consisted of roughly $46.2 million related to SBA PPP loans funded, or 18.7%, to $460.8 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $388.2 million at June 30, 2019, an increase in other borrowings of $1.9 million, or 411.1%, from $450,000 at June 30, 2019 to $2.3 million at June 30, 2020, and an increase of $1.4 million, or 92.1%, in other liabilities from $1.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $3.0 million at June 30, 2020, partially offset by a decrease of $295,000, or 21.8%, in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank from $1.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $1.1 million at June 30, 2020 and a decrease of $62,000, or 10.6%, in advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance from $584,000 at June 30, 2019 to $522,000 at June 30, 2020. The increase in deposits was primarily due to a $44.2 million, or 111.8%, increase in savings deposits from $39.6 million at June 30, 2019 to $83.8 million at June 30, 2020, a $44.0 million, or 74.3%, increase in non-interest bearing deposits from $59.4 million at June 30, 2019 to $103.4 million at June 30, 2020, and a $10.3 million, or 33.2%, increase in NOW accounts from $31.0 million at June 30, 2019 to $41.4 million at June 30, 2020, partially offset by a decrease of $25.7 million, or 14.0%, in certificates of deposit from $183.3 million at June 30, 2019 to $157.6 million at June 30, 2020, and a decrease in money market deposits of $297,000, or 0.4%, from $74.9 million at June 30, 2019 to $74.6 million at June 30, 2020. The Company had $16.1 million in brokered deposits at June 30, 2020 compared to $11.2 million at June 30, 2019. The decrease in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank was primarily principal payments on amortizing advances.\nShareholders' equity increased $193,000, or 0.4%, to $50.5 million at June 30, 2020 from $50.3 million at June 30, 2019. The primary reasons for the changes in shareholders' equity from June 30, 2019 were net income of $3.9 million, the vesting of restricted stock awards, stock options, and the release of employee stock ownership plan shares totaling $667,000, an increase in the Company's accumulated other comprehensive income of $895,000, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options of $65,000, partially offset by the acquisition of Company stock of $4.1 million and dividends paid totaling $1.1 million.\nAverage Balances, Net Interest Income Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Tax-exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. All average balances are based on monthly balances. Management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be.\n\n__________________\n(1) Includes loans held for sale.\n(2) Includes retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n(3) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted-average rate on interest-bearing liabilities.\n(4) Net interest margin is net interest income divided by net average interest-earning assets.\nRate/Volume Analysis. The following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected Home Federal Bancorp's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by current year volume), and (iii) total change in rate and volume. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.\n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019\nGeneral. The decrease in net income for the year ended June 30, 2020 resulted primarily from an increase of $1.3 million, or 11.8%, in non-interest expense, a $1.3 million, or 215.2%, increase in the provision for loan losses, and a decrease of $132,000, or 0.9% in net interest income, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million, or 63.5%, in non-interest income and a $326,000, or 25.4%, decrease in the provision for income taxes. The decrease in net interest income for the year was due to a $622,000, or 13.7%, increase in interest expense on borrowings and deposits, partially offset by a $490,000, or 2.5%, increase in total interest income. The Company's average interest rate spread was 3.13% for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.49% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The Company's net interest margin was 3.46% for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.78% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in the average interest rate spread and net interest margin was attributable primarily to a decrease of 26 basis points in average rate on interest earning assets for the year, from 4.90% at June 30, 2019 to 4.64% at June 30, 2020.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income amounted to $15.2 million for fiscal year 2020, a decrease of $132,000, or 0.9%, compared to $15.3 million for fiscal year 2019. The decrease was due primarily to an increase of $622,000 in interest expense, partially offset by a $490,000 increase in total interest income.\nThe average interest rate spread decreased from 3.49% for fiscal 2019 to 3.13% for fiscal 2020, while the average balance of interest-earning assets increased from $404.6 million to $438.7 million\nduring the same periods. The percentage of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 128.57% for fiscal 2020 compared to 125.65% for fiscal 2019. The decrease in the average interest rate spread and net interest margin was attributable primarily to a decrease of 26 basis points in average rate on interest earning assets for the year, from 4.90% at June 30, 2019 to 4.64% at June 30, 2020. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased from 1.82% for fiscal 2019 to 2.05% for fiscal 2020. Net interest margin decreased to 3.46% for fiscal 2020 compared to 3.78% for fiscal 2019.\nInterest income increased $490,000, or 2.5%, to $20.3 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $19.8 million for fiscal 2019, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans of $377,000 for fiscal 2020 compared to 2019. The aggregate interest income from investment and mortgage-backed securities increased $151,000 for the same period. The increase in the average balance of loans receivable was primarily due to new loans originated by our commercial lending division. The average yield of the loan portfolio decreased by 10 basis points during fiscal 2020 mainly due to a lower interest rate environment.\nInterest expense increased $622,000, or 13.7%, to $5.2 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $4.5 million for fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. Interest paid on deposits increased during fiscal 2020.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings as losses are estimated to have occurred in our loan portfolio. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information or events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is impaired, the measurement of such impairment is based upon the fair value of the collateral of the loan. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we will recognize the impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge against earnings.\nAn allowance is also established for uncollectible interest on loans classified as substandard. The allowance is established by a charge to interest income equal to all interest previously accrued, and income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received. When, in management's judgment, the borrower's ability to make interest and principal payments is back to normal, the loan is returned to accrual status.\nA provision of $1.9 million was made to the allowance during fiscal 2020, compared to a provision of $600,000 in fiscal 2019. At June 30, 2020, the Company had $7.2 million of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, and other real estate owned) compared to $5.1 million of non-performing assets at June 30, 2019, consisting of two commercial business loans, three commercial real estate loans, eight single-family residential loans, one lot loan, one land loan, and two commercial real estate loans in other real estate owned at June 30, 2020, compared to five single-family residential loans, two line of credit loans, two commercial business loans, one lot loan, one land loan, one residential lot in other real estate owned, and two properties that secured single-family residential loans in other real estate owned at June 30, 2019. The increase in non-performing assets from $5.1 million at June 30, 2019 to $7.2 million at June 30, 2020 was primarily due to a $2.3 million borrower relationship, consisting of six loans to one borrower which include three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan that were placed on non-accrual status. The six loans had previously been paying interest only payments and were classified as troubled debt restructurings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2020, the Company had four single family residential loans, two commercial land and lot development loans, and six loans to one borrower consisting of three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan classified as substandard compared to four single family residential loans, one line of credit loan, two commercial business loans, two commercial land and lot development loans, and six loans to one borrower consisting of three commercial real estate loans, two non-real estate loans, and one single family residential loan classified as substandard at June 30, 2019. There were no loans classified as doubtful at June 30, 2020 or June 30, 2019.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income amounted to $3.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $1.5 million, or 63.5%, compared to non-interest income of $2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $1.5 million increase in non-interest income for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to an increase of $925,000 in gain on sale of loans, combined with decreases of $345,000 in loss on sale of real estate, an increase of $219,000 in gain on sale of securities and a $44,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $18,000 in other income, and a decrease of $1,000 on income from bank owned life insurance.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $1.3 million, or 11.8%, in fiscal 2020 due to increases of $1.2 million in compensation and benefits expense, $168,000 in occupancy and equipment expense, $67,000 in franchise and bank shares tax expense, $41,000 in data processing expense, and $27,000 in loan and collection expense. Non-interest expense increases were partially offset by decreases of $72,000 in advertising expense, $57,000 in audit and examination fees, $49,000 in legal fees, $39,000 in deposit insurance premiums, and $20,000 in other non-interest expense.\nProvision for Income Tax Expense. The provision for income taxes amounted to $957,000 and $1.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 19.9% for fiscal 2020 and 21.3% for fiscal 2019.\nExposure to Changes in Interest Rates\nOur ability to maintain net interest income depends upon our ability to earn a higher yield on interest-earning assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings. Our interest-earning assets consist primarily of securities available-for-sale and long-term residential and commercial mortgage loans, which have fixed rates of interest. Consequently, our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings can be adversely affected when market rates of interest rise.\nAlthough long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans made up a significant portion of our interest-earning assets at June 30, 2020, we sold a substantial amount of our one-to-four family residential loans we originated and maintained a significant portfolio of available-for-sale securities during the past few years in order to better position the Company for a rising interest rate environment in the long term. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, securities available-for-sale amounted to $42.0 million and $41.7 million, respectively, or 8.1% and 9.4%, respectively, of total assets at such dates.\nQuantitative Analysis. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency provides a quarterly report on the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of portfolio equity. Management reviews the quarterly reports from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which show the impact of changing interest rates on net portfolio value. Net portfolio value is the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts.\nNet Portfolio Value. Our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in our net portfolio value ( NPV\u201d) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of June 30, 2020:\n\nQualitative Analysis. Our ability to maintain a positive spread\u201d between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is affected by changes in interest rates. Our fixed-rate loans generally are profitable, if interest rates are stable or declining since these loans have yields that exceed our cost of funds. If interest rates increase, however, we would have to pay more on our deposits and new borrowings, which would adversely affect our interest rate spread. In order to counter the potential effects of dramatic increases in market rates of interest, we have underwritten our mortgage loans to allow for their sale in the secondary market. Total loan originations amounted to $311.4 million for fiscal 2020 and $232.9 million for fiscal 2019, while loans sold amounted to $111.8 million and $62.2 million during the same respective periods. We have invested excess funds from loan payments and prepayments and loan sales in investment securities classified as available-for-sale. As a result, Home Federal Bancorp is not as susceptible to rising interest rates as it would be if its interest-earning assets were primarily comprised of long-term fixed rate mortgage loans. With respect to its floating or adjustable rate loans, Home Federal Bancorp writes interest rate floors and caps into such loan documents. Interest rate floors limit our interest rate risk by limiting potential decreases in the interest yield on an adjustable rate loan to a certain level. As a result, we receive a minimum yield even if rates decline farther, and the interest rate on the particular loan would otherwise adjust to a lower amount. Conversely, interest rate ceilings limit the amount by which the yield on an adjustable rate loan may increase to no more than six percentage points over the rate at the time of origination. Finally, we intend to place a greater emphasis on shorter-term consumer loans and commercial business loans in the future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHome Federal Bancorp maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. Our liquidity ratio averaged 24.97% for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, loan sales and earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning accounts and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Our deposit accounts with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas amounted to $19.1 million and $5.9 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nA significant portion of our liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have borrowing agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which provide an additional source of funds. At June 30, 2020, we had $1.1 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and had $161.7 million in additional borrowing capacity. Additionally, at June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank was a party to a Master Purchase Agreement with First National Bankers Bank, whereby Home Federal Bank may purchase Federal Funds from First National Bankers Bank in an amount not to exceed $19.5 million. There were no amounts purchased under this agreement as of June 30, 2020. In addition, Home Federal Bancorp had available a $5.0 million line of credit agreement at June 30, 2020 with First National Bankers Bank. At June 30, 2020 there was a $2.3 million balance in the credit line.\nAt June 30, 2020, the Company had outstanding loan commitments of $53.1 million to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit of $8.5 million. At June 30, 2020, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled $88.0 million, or 55.9% of total certificates of deposit. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In addition, the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher upon renewal in a rising interest rate environment. We intend to utilize our high levels of liquidity to fund our lending activities. If additional funds are required to fund lending activities, we intend to sell our securities classified as available-for-sale, as needed.\nAt June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with tangible equity, common equity Tier 1, core, and total risk-based capital ratios of 10.21%, 16.37%, 10.21%, and 17.63%, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and have not had any such arrangements during the two years ended June 30, 2020. See Notes 9 and 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein regarding Home Federal Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on Home Federal Bancorp's performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates.\nAdditional COVID-19 Information\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 did not have a material impact on the financial results of the Company as of June 30, 2020. For the health of our customers and employees, the Bank closed lobbies to all seven branch offices and our main office through June 15, 2020 but remained fully operational. As an essential business, we continued to provide banking and financial services to our customers with drive-thru access available at all of our branch locations and in-person services available by appointment. In addition, we continued to provide access to banking and financial services through online banking, ATMs and by telephone.\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act was passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided an estimated $2.2 trillion of economy-wide financial stimulus to combat the pandemic and stimulate the economy in the form of financial aid to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, states, and municipalities through loans, grants, tax changes, and other types of relief.\nThe following describes some of our responses to COVID-19 relative to the CARES Act, and other effects of the pandemic on our business.\nPaycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act authorized the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d). We took action promptly to qualify as an SBA lender and were authorized to originate PPP loans.\nThrough June 30, 2020, Home Federal Bank has funded 374 PPP loans with total principal balances of $46.2 million to existing customers and key prospects located primarily in our trade area of NW Louisiana.\nLoan Modifications/Troubled Debt Restructurings. Under the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then suspend the requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Financial institutions wishing to utilize this authority must make a policy election, which applies to any COVID-19 modification made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of either December 31, 2020 or the 60th day after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency. Home Federal Bank has made that election. Similarly, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has confirmed that short-term modifications made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to loan customers who were current prior to any relief will not be considered TDRs.\nPrior to the enactment of the CARES Act, the banking regulatory agencies provided guidance as to how certain short-term modifications would not be considered TDRs, and have subsequently confirmed that such guidance could be applicable for loans that do not qualify for favorable accounting treatment under Section 4013 of the CARES Act.\nThe Bank handles loan payment modification requests on a case-by-case basis considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, related economic slow-down and stay-at-home orders on our customer and their current and projected cash flows through the term of the loan. Through June 30, 2020, we modified 216 loans with principal balances totaling $84.1 million representing 23.0% of our loans outstanding as of June 30, 2020. A majority of deferrals are three-month payment deferrals of principal and interest, with payments after deferral increased to collect amounts deferred. It is too early to determine if these modified loans will perform in accordance with their modified terms.\nDetails with respect to actual loan modifications are as follows:\n\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder). Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the beliefs, expectations or opinions of Home Federal Bancorp and its management regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as: believe\u201d, expect\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, plan\u201d, estimate\u201d, or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional terms such as will\u201d, would\u201d, should\u201d, could\u201d, may\u201d, likely\u201d, probably\u201d, or possibly.\u201d Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions; statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services; and statements regarding future performance. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumption, many of which are difficult to predict and generally are beyond the control of Home Federal Bancorp and its management, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: (1) economic and competitive conditions which could affect the volume of loan originations, deposit flows and real estate values; (2) the levels of non-interest income and expense and the amount of loan losses; (3) competitive pressure among depository institutions increasing significantly; (4) changes in the interest rate environment causing reduced interest margins; (5) general economic conditions, either nationally or in the markets in which Home Federal Bancorp is or will be doing business, being less favorable than expected (6) political and social unrest including acts of war or terrorism; (7) the impact of the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) or (8) legislation or changes in regulatory requirements adversely affecting the business in which Home Federal Bancorp will be engaged. Home Federal Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made.",

key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Net income for fiscal 2020 was $3.9 million, down from $4.7 million in fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher non-interest expense, increased provision for loan losses, and lower net interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest income and lower tax expense. \n\n- Net interest income fell 0.9% to $15.2 million, as interest expense rose more than interest income due to higher rates paid on deposits. Net interest margin declined to 3.46% from 3.78%.\n\n- Provision for loan losses increased 215% to $1.9 million due to growth in non-performing assets. Non-performing assets rose to $7.2 million from $5.1 million.\n\n- Non-interest income rose 63.5% to $3.9 million, mostly driven by higher gains on sale of loans and securities. \n\n- Non-interest expense increased 11.8% to $13.2 million, largely reflecting higher compensation and occupancy costs.  \n\n- Total assets grew 17.1% to $518.2 million, primarily driven by increases in cash, loans, and loans held-for-sale. Total deposits rose 18.7%.\n\n- The Company funded $46.2 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans and modified $84.1 million in loans (23% of total loans) under COVID-19 relief measures.\n\nIn summary, earnings fell in fiscal 2020 but asset growth remained strong. Credit quality weakened but liquidity increased substantially. COVID-19 relief efforts assisted customers but cloud the outlook."}
