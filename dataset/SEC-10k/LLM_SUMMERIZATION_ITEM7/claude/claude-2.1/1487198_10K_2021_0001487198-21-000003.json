MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the Risk Factors contained herein.\nKey Terms\nIn connection with the management of our businesses, we identify, measure and assess a variety of operating metrics. The principal metrics we use in managing our businesses are set forth below:\nOperating Metrics\n\u2022Lifetime Value (\"LTV\") - Lifetime Value as the weighted average total amount of tuition and fees paid by every new student that enrolls in the Company's universities, after giving effect to attrition.\n\u2022Bookings - defined by multiplying LTV by new student enrollments for each operating unit.\n\u2022Average Revenue per Enrollment (\"ARPU\") - defined by dividing total bookings by total enrollments for each operating unit.\nOperating costs and expenses\n\u2022Cost of revenues - consists of instructional costs and services and marketing and promotional costs.\n\u25e6Instructional costs - consist primarily of costs related to the administration and delivery of the Company's educational programs. This expense category includes compensation costs associated with online faculty, technology license costs and costs associated with other support groups that provide services directly to the students and are included in cost of revenues.\n\u25e6Marketing and promotional costs - include costs associated with producing marketing materials and advertising, and outside sales costs. Such costs are generally affected by the cost of advertising media, the efficiency of the Company's marketing and recruiting efforts, and expenditures on advertising initiatives for\nnew and existing academic programs. Non-direct response advertising activities are expensed as incurred, or the first time the advertising takes place, depending on the type of advertising activity and are included in cost of revenues.\n\u2022General and administrative expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive and academic management and operations, finance, legal, tax, information technology and human resources, fees for professional services, financial aid processing costs, non-capitalizable courseware and software costs, corporate taxes and facilities costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures:\n\u2022Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") - is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP - Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\u2022Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") - is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP - Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nCompany Overview\nAspen Group, Inc. is an education technology holding company. It operates two universities, Aspen University Inc. (\"Aspen University\") and United States University Inc. (\"United States University\" or \"USU\").\nAll references to the Company\u201d, AGI\u201d, Aspen Group\u201d, we\u201d, our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Aspen Group, Inc., unless the context otherwise indicates.\nAGI leverages its education technology infrastructure and expertise to allow its two universities, Aspen University and United States University, to deliver on the vision of making college affordable again. Because we believe higher education should be a catalyst to our students' long-term economic success, we exert financial prudence by offering affordable tuition that is one of the greatest values in higher education. AGI's primary focus relative to future growth is to target the high growth nursing profession. As of April 30, 2021, 12,046 of 13,886 or 87% of all active students across both universities are degree-seeking nursing students. Of the 12,046 students seeking nursing degrees, 9,664 are Registered Nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree at Aspen University (7,028) and United States University (2,636), while the remaining 2,382 nursing students are enrolled in Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in the Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville metros.\nIn March 2014, Aspen University began offering a monthly payment plan available to all students across every online degree program offered by Aspen University. The monthly payment plan is designed so that students will make one payment per month, and that monthly payment is applied towards the total cost of attendance (tuition and fees, excluding textbooks). The monthly payment plan offers online undergraduate students the opportunity to pay their tuition and fees at $250/month, online master students $325/month, and online doctoral students $375/month, interest free, thereby giving students a monthly payment option versus taking out a federal financial aid loan.\nUSU began offering monthly payment plans in the summer of 2017. Today, monthly payment plans are available for the online RN to BSN program ($250/month), online MBA/MAEd/MSN programs ($325/month), online hybrid Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, Teacher Credentialing tracks approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing ($350/month), and the online hybrid Masters of Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner ( FNP\u201d) program ($375/month).\nSince 1993, Aspen University has been nationally accredited by the DEAC, a national accrediting agency recognized by the DOE and CHEA. On February 25, 2019, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years to January 2024.\nSince 2009, USU has been regionally accredited by WSCUC.\nBoth universities are qualified to participate under the Higher Education Act and the Federal student financial assistance programs (Title IV, HEA programs).\nAGI Student Population Overview\nAGI's overall active student body (includes both Aspen University and USU) grew 21% year-over-year to 13,886 from 11,444 as of April 30, 2021 and students seeking nursing degrees were 12,046 or 87% of total active students at both universities. Of the 12,046 students seeking nursing degrees, 9,664 are Registered Nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree at a Aspen University (7,028) and United States University (2,636), while the remaining 2,382 nursing students are enrolled in Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in the Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville metros.\nAspen University's total active student body increased by 17% year-over-year to 11,117 from 9,487. On a year-over-year basis, USU's total active student body grew by 41% to 2,769 from 1,957. The chart below shows five quarters of active student body results. Active student body is comprised of active degree-seeking students, enrolled in a course at the end of fiscal year 2021 or are registered for an upcoming course.\nAGI New Student Enrollments\nFor the fourth-quarter fiscal year 2021, new student enrollments increased by 23% year-over-year to 2,182. Below is a table reflecting new student enrollments for the past five quarters:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>New Student Enrollments by Quarter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Q4 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Q1 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Q2 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Q3 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Q4 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aspen University </td> <td>1,344 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,779 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,010 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,593 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,593 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>USU </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> <td>572 </td> <td> </td> <td>649 </td> <td> </td> <td>536 </td> <td> </td> <td>589 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,776 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,351 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,659 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,129 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,182 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBookings Analysis and ARPU\nOn a year-over-year basis, Bookings rose by 29% to $143.4 million from $111.3 million in the prior year.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fourth Quarter Bookings1 and Average Revenue Per Enrollment (ARPU)1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>FY '21 Enrollments </td> <td> </td> <td>FY '21 Bookings </td> <td> </td> <td>FY '20 Enrollments </td> <td> </td> <td>FY '20 Bookings </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change Total Bookings & ARPU </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aspen University </td> <td>6,975 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,560,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,953 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,734,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>USU </td> <td>2,346 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,805,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,715 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,561,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>9,321 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,366,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,668 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,295,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARPU </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Bookings\u201d are defined by multiplying Lifetime Value (LTV) by new student enrollments for each operating unit. Average Revenue Per Enrollment\u201d (ARPU) is defined by dividing total Bookings by total new student enrollments for each operating unit.\nThe Company focused its growth capital over the past fiscal year almost exclusively on its two licensure degree programs which have higher lifetime values. Set forth below is the description of these two key licensure degree programs.\nBachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Pre-Licensure Program\nAspen University offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Pre-Licensure degree program (the BSN Pre-Licensure Program\u201d). This innovative hybrid (online/on-campus) program allows most of the credits to be completed online (83 of 120 credits or 69%), with pricing offered at current low tuition rates of $150/credit hour for online general education courses, $325/credit hour for online core nursing courses, and $495 for core clinical courses. For students with no prior college credits, the total cost of attendance is less than $50,000.\nPhoenix, AZ Campus Locations\nAspen University began offering the BSN Pre-Licensure program in July 2018 at its initial campus in Phoenix, Arizona. As a result of overwhelming demand in the Phoenix metropolitan area, in January 2019 Aspen University began offering both day (July, November, March) and evening/weekend (January, May, September) terms, equaling six term starts per year. In September 2019, Aspen University opened a second campus in the Phoenix metropolitan area in partnership with HonorHealth.\nOn the February 2, 2021 semester start date, Aspen University implemented its first double cohort enrollment at its main campus in Phoenix. A total of 57 students entered the core BSN-PL program at the Main Campus, in two cohorts of 29 and 28, respectively. Additionally, 29 students entered the program at the HonorHealth campus, bringing the total two-year core program semester starts in February, 2021 to 86 students, an increase of over 70% from the prior year period for this program in the Phoenix metro. Aspen University implements six semester start dates per annum in Arizona. With the introduction of double cohorts at its main campus in Phoenix, the university is now on pace to start approximately 500 students per annum in the Phoenix metro into the final two-year core program, up from the prior run rate of approximately 300 students. Given the revenue per student for the final two-year core program is approximately $20,000 per annum, that equates to an approximate $10 million revenue run rate per annum in the Phoenix metro, up from approximately $6 million with single cohorts, excluding revenues earned from over approximately 1,300 first-year online pre-requisite students currently enrolled in the Phoenix metro.\nBSN Pre-Licensure Campus Locations Opened in Fiscal Year 2020 - First Half of Fiscal Year 2021\nAustin, TX\nAspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in Austin is based in the Frontera Crossing office building located at 101 W. Louis Henna Boulevard in the suburb of Round Rock. The building is situated at the junction of Interstate 35 and State Highway 45, one of the most heavily trafficked freeway exchanges in the metropolitan area with visibility to approximately 143,362 cars per day. Aspen University's initial PPN nursing student enrollments began on the September 29, 2020 semester start date.\nAspen University has executed a clinical affiliation agreement with Baylor Scott & White Health - Central division, the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas and one of the largest in the United States. Baylor Scott & White Health includes 48 hospitals, more than 800 patient care sites, more than 7,800 active physicians, over 47,000 employees and the Scott & White Health Plan.\nTampa, FL\nAspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in Tampa is located at 12802 Tampa Oaks Boulevard. The building is visible from the intersection of Interstate 75 and East Fletcher Avenue, near the University of South Florida, providing visibility to approximately 126,500 cars per day. Aspen University's initial PPN nursing student enrollments began on the December 8, 2020 semester start date.\nAspen University has executed a clinical affiliation agreement with Bayfront Health, a regional network of seven hospitals and over 1,900 staff medical professionals serving the residents of the Tampa Bay area to provide required clinical placements for its nursing students. In addition, clinical affiliation agreements have been signed in the Tampa metropolitan area with John Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Inc., Care Connections at Home, Global Nurse Network, LLC and The American National Red Cross.\nNashville, TN Campus\nOn March 8, 2021, the Company announced that Aspen University received the final required state and board of registered nursing regulatory approvals for their new BSN Pre-Licensure campus location in Nashville, Tennessee, with permission to commence marketing and begin to enroll first-year PPN students effective immediately. Aspen University is targeting to begin its initial (years 2-3) core program semester in Nashville in October, 2021.\nThe Nashville campus will be located at 1809 Dabbs Avenue, which is situated right on Interstate 40 east of downtown Nashville, four miles west of the Nashville airport. Clinical affiliation agreements have been executed with NorthCrest Medical Center, Trust Point Hospital, and Nashville General Hospital, among others.\nUSU Master of Science in Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner (MSN-FNP)\nUSU offers a number of nursing degree programs and other degree programs in health sciences, business & technology and education. Its primary enrollment program is its MSN-FNP which is designed for BSN-prepared registered nurses who are seeking a Nurse Practitioner license. The MSN-FNP is an online-hybrid 50-credit degree program with 100% of the curriculum online, including the curricular component to complete 540 clinical and 32 lab hours.\nWhile MSN-FNP lab hours have been done at USU's San Diego facility through the end of calendar 2020, the rapid growth of the MSN-FNP program has caused AGI to open two additional immersion locations in 2021. Specifically, the Company built-out an additional suite on the ground floor of our main facility in Phoenix (by the airport) and recently opened the Tampa clinical facility. Consequently, students now have the option to attend their weekend immersions at three different metro locations: San Diego, Phoenix and Tampa.\nOn July 7, 2020, the Company announced an affiliation partnership with American-Advanced Practice Network (A-APN), a national clinical network for advanced practice nurses that provides comprehensive health care and nursing services at its outpatient centers and clinical facilities throughout the U.S.\nA-APN offers independent nurse practitioners (NPs) a unique, multi-state network or \"group practice without walls\" with best-in-class technology and business support. A-APN was created for and by NPs. Rural and remote members of the network have nationwide, trusted peer cross-coverage for patients. A-APN members deliver clinical care using CareSpan's Digital Care Delivery platform, facilitating care delivery in-person, or at a distance. The platform includes diagnostics, EMR, e-prescribing, remote monitoring, and dynamic documentation.\nThrough this affiliation, A-APN will appoint an Educational Coordinator to work with USU's Office of Field Experience to place USU MSN-FNP students with qualified, experienced NP preceptors. This telehealth partnership enables MSN-FNP students to complete their required direct care clinical hours with A-APN throughout the COVID-19 crisis and thereafter.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN\nThe Company's accounts receivable over the last several years has predominantly been a result of our groundbreaking monthly payment plan (or MPP) which we introduced in 2014 at Aspen University and subsequently in Fiscal Year 2018 at USU.\nSince the beginning of fiscal year 2021, the monthly payment plan accounts receivable balance, both short-term and long-term, has increased by approximately $6.5 million. The attractive aspect of being able to pay for a degree over a fixed period of time has fueled the growth of this plan.\nEach student's receivable account is different depending on how many classes a student takes each period. If a student takes two classes each eight-week period while paying $250, $325 or $375 a month, that student's account receivable balance will rise accordingly.\nThe common thread is the actual monthly payment, which functions as a retail installment contract with no interest that each student commits to pay over a fixed number of months. Aspen University students paying tuition and fees through a monthly payment method grew by 18% year-over-year, from 5,888 to 6,953. Those 6,953 students paying through a monthly payment method represent 63% of Aspen University's total active student body.\nHistorically, we have issued approximately $70 million of credit to Aspen University's MPP students, and to date, we have written off $667,000 or approximately 1% of those accounts receivable. Bad debt reserve for this accounts receivable is currently $2.8 million which we believe is appropriate.\nUSU's MPP accounted for the majority of the Company's increase of accounts receivable this fiscal year. Specifically, the Company's long-term accounts receivable during this fiscal year increased from $6.7 million to $10.2 million with USU accounting for 77% of that increase. The Company's short-term accounts receivable, net, during this fiscal year increased from $14.3 million to $16.7 million with USU accounting for 44% of that increase. In addition to the Company's experience with the FNP students, these people generally earn more than $100,000 per year which reduces the collection risk.\nWhile the majority of the accounts receivable increase for the Company in the past year has been through issuing credit to Nurse Practitioner students at USU, the collection history of these FNP students is tracking materially better than the Company's collection history of Aspen University MPP students. From 2018 to 2019, the Company issued approximately $17 million of credit to USU FNP students on the six year payment plan. As of April 30, 2021, the Company has collected to date approximately $8 million of that $17 million, so the remaining accounts receivable is approximately $8.7 million.\nThe total student count that makes up the $8.7 million of USU FNP MPP student accounts receivable is approximately 750 students; 45% of those students have graduated, while 39% remain active students today in the university, and the remaining 16% are no longer enrolled. Of those students, the Company currently has 25 students that have not made a recent monthly payment which accounts for total accounts receivable of $174,000 or 1.0% of the total credit issued to date. We believe the 6-year MPP accounts receivable will perform materially better than Aspen University's MPP history which has performed well to date.\nChange in Business Mix and Relationship to Accounts Receivable\nDuring fiscal year 2021 revenue from students using the Monthly Payment Plan increased by approximately 19% year over year, but declined as a percentage of total revenue for the third year in a row down from 57.2% in 2020 to 49.5% in 2021, while total revenue increased 38% year over year.\nOur highest lifetime value business unit is Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure business. This is our fastest growing business unit and now represents 21% of total annual revenue. We expect the revenue from this unit to continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenue as we continue to expand our campus footprint from 4 to over 12 campuses over the next 5 years.\nThis change in our business mix is expected to have a meaningful impact on our accounts receivable and our allowance for doubtful accounts. The BSN Pre-Licensure program requires payment prior to the start of each term. This means that nearly 100% of all revenue from this program will be paid in advance; meaningfully reducing our accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of our total revenue.\nAs revenue from this program continues to grow as a percentage of overall revenue, we expect that we will see a corresponding increase in our cash flows from operations that in turn will allow AGI to turn cash flow positive and generate positive free cash flow over time.\nIn addition to this change in our business mix, we continue to evolve the analysis of our accounts receivable and expanded our analysis to include evaluation of all payment types, student status, and aging within programs. As we upgrade our financial systems we expect to gain greater ability to track discrete data faster and easier to support more proactive student engagement that we believe will improve the performance of our student receivable portfolio.\nAs we identify program and student status specific trends, we will strive to create ways to isolate program specific revenue and accounts receivable activity to gather, analyze and report program specific data and trends. Over time, we will use this knowledge to enhance our allowance reserving policies going forward.\nBy improving visibility into trends earlier we expect to see improvement in overall student performance and a reduction of account delinquencies.\nReserving for Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Charges to the Allowance\nAs part of the account receivable analysis discussed earlier, we evaluated our long-term MPP and other payment type student receivables. The analysis evaluated students in two categories: nursing and non-nursing. Based on our analysis of the payment details and student performance, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we charged $76,000 of MPP receivables against the reserve for doubtful accounts. The MPP receivables will be evaluated in conjunction with our updated recovery and collection process and we expect results to be positive. For fiscal year 2021, no changes to the methodology were made and approximately\n$740,000 of student accounts receivable were written off. The Company continues to review accounts receivable for reasonableness.\nOur accounts receivable remaining for former students are from 2018 or more recent with the exception of certain alumni from our nursing programs. We believe our analysis is appropriate and reasonable. We further believe that we are positioned to focus our enhanced recovery and collections efforts on delinquencies and past due amounts from recent graduates and current enrolled students.\nBased on our review of accounts receivable, overall revenue growth trends and changes in our mix of business, we evaluated our reserve methodology and increased our reserve through a charge to bad debt by $340,000 for Aspen University and by $226,540 for USU also in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Note that AGI's bad debt allowance started the year at $1.759 million and ended the year at $3.290 million.\nAs part of the process of evaluating our reserving methodology we also evaluated our processes in student accounts, our accounts receivable recovery and collections processes. We have designed an enhanced recovery and collections process that is expected to begin recovery of student late payments earlier and manage these students more proactively during their course of study and post-graduation for MPP students\nWe will continue to reserve against our receivables based on revenue growth trends, mix of business and specific trends we identify on a program by program basis. We believe we currently have sufficient reserves against our current student portfolio but we intend to stay vigilant to become aware of external changes that could affect our students ability to meet their obligations such as the continuation of the COVID-19 economic slowdown or other external events and circumstances that could give us reason to make a material change to our current methodology and reserve policy.\nOver time we expect the change in our mix of business together with process improvements and collection enhancements to result in a better managed portfolio of student receivables and improving cash flow from operations.\nRelationship Between Accounts Receivable and Revenue\nThe gross accounts receivable balance for any period is the net effect of the following three factors:\n1.Revenue;\n2.Cash receipts, and;\n3.The net change in deferred revenue.\nAll three factors equally determine the gross accounts receivable. If one quarter experiences particularly high cash receipts, the gross accounts receivable will go down. The same effect happens if cash receipts are lower or if there are significant changes in either of the other factors.\nSimply looking at the change in revenue does not translate into an equally similar change in gross accounts receivable. The relative change in cash and the deferral must also be considered. For net accounts receivable, the changes in the reserve must also be considered. Any additional reserve or write-offs will influence the balance.\nAs it is a straight mathematical formula for both gross accounts receivable and net accounts receivable, and most of the information is public, one can reasonably calculate the two non-public pieces of information, namely the cash receipts in gross accounts receivable and the write-offs in net accounts receivable.\nFor revenue, the quarterly change is primarily billings and the net impact of deferred revenue. The deferral from the prior quarter or year is added to the billings and the deferral at the end of the period is subtracted from the amount billed. The total deferred revenue at the end of every period is reflected in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred revenue can vary for many reasons, but seasonality and the timing of the class starts in relation to the end of the quarter will cause changes in the balance.\nAs mentioned in the accounts receivable discussion above, the change in revenue cannot be compared to the change in accounts receivable. Revenue does not have the impact of cash received whereas accounts receivable does. Depending on the month and the amount of cash received, it is likely that revenue or accounts receivable will increase at a rate different from the other. The impact of cash is easy to substantiate as it agrees to deposits in our bank accounts.\nAt April 30, 2021, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $3,289,816 which represents 11% of the gross accounts receivable balance of $30,264,393, the sum of both short-term and long-term receivables.\nLong-Term Accounts Receivable\nWhen a student signs up for the monthly payment plan, there is a contractual amount that the Company can expect to earn over the life of the student's program. This contractual amount cannot be recorded as an account receivable as the student does have the option to stop attending. As a student takes a class, revenue is earned over that eight-week class. Some students accelerate their program, taking two classes every eight-week period, and as we discussed, that increases the student's accounts receivable balance. If any portion of that balance will be paid in a period greater than 12 months, that portion is reflected as long-term accounts receivable.\nAs a result of the growing acceptance of our monthly payment plans, our long-term accounts receivable balance has grown from $6,701,136 at April 30, 2020 to $10,249,833 at April 30, 2021. These are MPP students who make monthly payments over 36, 39 and 72 months. The average student completes their academic program in 30 months; therefore, most of the Company's accounts receivable are short-term. However, when students graduate earlier than the 30 month average completion duration, they transition to long-term accounts receivable. Those are the two primary factors that have driven an increase in long-term accounts receivable.\nHere is a graphic of both short-term and long-term receivables, as well as contractual value:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A\n</td> <td>B\n</td> <td>C\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments owed for classes taken where payment plans for classes are less than 12 months, less monthly payments received </td> <td>Payments owed for classes taken where payment plans are greater than 12 months </td> <td>Expected classes\nto be taken over\nbalance of program. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term\nAccounts Receivable\n</td> <td>Long-term\nAccounts Receivable\n</td> <td>Not recorded in\nfinancial statements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nThe Sum of A, B and C will equal the total cost of the program.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOVID-19 Update\nNursing students represented 87% or 12,046 of the Company's total student body of 13,886 students at fiscal year-end 2021. Of the 12,046 nursing students, 2,382 are BSN Pre-Licensure students located across our four metro locations (Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville). The remaining 9,664 nursing students are licensed registered nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree (RN to BSN, MSN or DNP degree programs). These 9,664 post-licensure nursing students therefore represent 70% of the Company's total student body and are the population of AGI students that have been primarily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that AGI has the highest student body concentration of RNs among publicly-traded higher education companies in the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the need to track RN behaviors and attitudes carefully for the past 16 months. Below are the effects the Company has seen to date relative to class starts and enrollments.\nThe Company previously reported that RN course starts at both universities were approximately 4% lower than historically expected during the months of September, 2020 - January, 2021, which resulted in approximately $520,000 less revenues in the fiscal third quarter. However, beginning in late February 2021, RN course starts returned to historically normal levels throughout the remainder of the fourth fiscal quarter which resulted in revenues of $19.1 million for the quarter, approximately $500,000 higher than the midpoint of our previous forecast.\nThe Company's fiscal first quarter has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter among our RN student body given it falls during the late-spring/summer months, and thus far in the quarter (May and June) we are seeing lower inquiries, conversion rates and enrollments among prospective RN students than expected, which we believe is due to RNs \u2018taking a deep breath' and taking time off with their families now that vaccination rates and hospitalizations have materially improved. The Company is also seeing lower course starts in the first quarter than seasonally expected among its RN student body. We believe this will be a short-lived \u2018summer break' slowdown, with a return to normalized enrollment and course start levels in our second fiscal quarter (August - October).\nResults of Operations\nFor the Three Months Ended April 30, 2021 Compared to the Three Months Ended April 30, 2020 and Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2020\nRevenue\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Q4 2021\") compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Q4 2020\")\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$19,051,076 </td> <td> </td> <td>$4,971,883 </td> <td> </td> <td>35% </td> <td> </td> <td>$14,079,193 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from operations for Fiscal Q4 2021 increased to $19,051,076 from $14,079,193 for Fiscal Q4 2020, an increase of $4,971,883 or 35%. The increase was primarily due to enrollment and student body growth in USU's MSN-FNP and Aspen's BSN Pre-Licensure program, the degree programs with the highest lifetime value (LTV).

Without these items, the net loss increase would have been approximately $2.2 million. This $2.2 million increase in net loss year-over-year is primarily a result of the new campus costs at Aspen University (approximately $1.6 million) and CFO transition costs disclosed above.\nNon-GAAP - Financial Measures\nThis discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss), and cash flow from operating activities, liquidity or any other financial measures. They may not be\nindicative of the historical operating results of AGI nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOur management uses and relies on EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that management, analysts and shareholders benefit from referring to the following non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of items that affect comparability. Our management recognizes that the non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations because of the excluded items described below.\nWe have included a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between AGI and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measure and the corresponding GAAP measure provided by each company under applicable SEC rules.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nAGI defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding: (1) bad debt expense; (2) stock-based compensation; and (3) non-recurring charges.

Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation, bad debt expense, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of debt discounts and issue costs, warrants issued for services, modification charge for warrants exercised, common shares issued for services and other adjustments.\nAdjustments to net loss consist primarily of tenant improvement allowances received from landlords of $4,685,826, stock-based compensation of $3,958,085, depreciation and amortization expense of $2,426,365, bad debt expense of $2,268,540, and amortization of debt discounts of $1,550,854. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consists of increases in deferred revenue of $3,112,020 and accrued expenses of $1,140,253, partially offset by increases in gross accounts receivable (both short and long term accounts receivable, before allowance for doubtful accounts) of $8,215,190. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to timing of billings for class starts. Accrued expenses increased due primarily to accrual of executive bonus for Fiscal 2021, accrued payroll due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense to support the growth of the business and an increase in accrued marketing due to timing. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to the growth in revenues from increased enrollments and students paying through the monthly payment plan as well as timing of billings for class starts.\nThe Company expects a favorable trend in working capital over time, but there may be volatility from quarter to quarter. In aggregate the Company expects a general trend toward lower cash used in operations in future quarters; however, some quarters could have higher cash used in operations as a result of more cash used to support changes in working capital. Program start timings and the related federal financial aid drawdowns also impact cash timing.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended April 30, 2020 consist primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of $2,203,461, stock-based compensation of $2,116,309 and bad debt expense of $1,431,210. The increase from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in gross accounts receivable (both short and long term accounts receivable, before allowance for doubtful accounts) of $8,717,424, partially offset by increases in deferred revenue of $1,256,129 and $1,197,343 due to students. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to the growth in revenues from increased enrollments and students paying through the monthly payment plan as well as timing of billings for class starts. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to timing of billings for class starts.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 includes purchases of property and equipment of $8,848,395 primarily due to investments in leasehold improvements, computer equipment and hardware, Company developed software and new campuses; purchases of courseware and accreditation of $120,408 and purchase of a domain name of $8,500.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended April 30, 2020 includes purchases of property and equipment of $3,276,510 primarily due to investments in Company developed software, computer equipment and hardware, instructional equipment and new campuses; and purchases of courseware and accreditation of $13,851.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 includes proceeds from stock options exercised of $2,669,247 and proceeds from warrants exercised of $1,081,792 received from the cash exercise of warrants associated with the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2020 includes proceeds from the sale of common stock, net of underwriter costs of $16,044,879; proceeds from stock options exercised of $962,650; and a common stock short swing reclamation of $21,760, partially offset by $51,282 of disbursements for equity offering costs.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAt July 9, 2021, the Company had cash deposits of approximately $12.1 million, including $4.1 million of restricted cash. Our cash balances are kept liquid to support our growing infrastructure needs. The majority of our cash is concentrated in large financial institutions.\nThe Company also has access to a $5 million Revolving Credit Facility. At April 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility.\nThe Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its campus operations. The Company's Fiscal year 2022 capital expenditures are expected to be lower than Fiscal Year 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $0.5 million related to new campus costs. Additionally, the Company expects additional cash commitments for letters of credits related to securing new campus locations.\nThe Company expects that its existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund its working capital, including capital expenditures, investing and other needs for more than the next 12 months. As disclosed earlier in this Report, the Company intends to be net income positive by Fiscal Q4 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn response to financial reporting release FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, from the SEC, we have selected our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on our financial condition. There were no material changes to our principal accounting estimates during the period covered by this report.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nRevenue consisting primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught by Aspen online as well as from related educational resources that Aspen provides to its students, such as access to our online materials and learning management system. Tuition revenue is recognized pro-rata over the applicable period of instruction. Aspen maintains an institutional tuition refund policy, which provides for all or a portion of tuition to be refunded if a student withdraws during stated refund periods. Certain states in which students reside impose separate, mandatory refund policies, which override Aspen's policy to the extent in conflict. If a student withdraws at a time when a portion or none of the tuition is refundable, then in accordance with its revenue recognition policy, Aspen recognizes as revenue the tuition that was not refunded. Since Aspen recognizes revenue pro-rata over the term of the course and because, under its institutional refund policy, the amount subject to refund is never greater than the amount of the revenue that has been deferred, under Aspen's accounting policies revenue is not recognized with respect to amounts that could potentially be refunded. Aspen's educational programs have starting and ending dates that differ from its fiscal quarters. Therefore, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a portion of revenue from these programs is not yet earned and is therefore deferred. Aspen also charges students annual fees for library, technology and other services, which are recognized over the related service period. Deferred revenue represents the amount of tuition, fees, and other student payments received in excess of the portion recognized as revenue and it is included in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Other revenue may be recognized as sales occur or services are performed.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nAll students are required to select both a primary and secondary payment option with respect to amounts due to Aspen for tuition, fees and other expenses. The most common payment option for Aspen's students is personal funds or payment made on their behalf by an employer. In instances where a student selects financial aid as the primary payment option, he or she often selects personal cash as the secondary option. If a student who has selected financial aid as his or her primary payment option withdraws prior to the end of a course but after the date that Aspen's institutional refund period has expired, the student will have incurred the obligation to pay the full cost of the course. If the withdrawal occurs before the date at which the student has earned 100% of his or her financial aid, Aspen will have to return all or a portion of the Title IV funds to the DOE and the student will owe Aspen all amounts incurred that are in excess of the amount of financial aid that the student earned and that Aspen is entitled to retain. In this case, Aspen must collect the receivable using the student's second payment option.\nFor accounts receivable from students, Aspen records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of its students to make required payments, which includes the recovery of financial aid funds advanced to a student for amounts in excess of the student's cost of tuition and related fees. Aspen determines the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts using a general reserve method based on an analysis of its historical bad debt experience, current economic trends, and the aging of the accounts receivable and student status. AGI establishes reserves to its receivables based upon an estimate of the risk presented by the program within the university, student status, payment type and age of receivables. Aspen writes off accounts receivable balances at the time the balances are deemed uncollectible. Aspen continues to reflect accounts receivable with an offsetting allowance as long as management believes there is a reasonable possibility of collection.\nFor accounts receivable from primary payors other than students, Aspen estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations, such as bankruptcy proceedings and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond contractual terms. In these cases, Aspen uses assumptions and judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances, to record a specific allowance for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These specific allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. The amounts calculated are analyzed to determine the total amount of the allowance. Aspen may also record a general allowance as necessary.\nDirect write-offs are taken in the period when Aspen has exhausted its efforts to collect overdue and unpaid receivables or otherwise evaluate other circumstances that indicate that Aspen should abandon such efforts.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the 2017 acquisition of USU. Goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested annually as of April 30 for impairment.\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04: \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)\u201d - to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2\nfrom the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company early adopted this standard effective April 30, 2018. We have selected an April 30 annual goodwill impairment test date.\nWhen evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, management first assesses a range of qualitative factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and the overall financial performance for each of the Company's reporting units. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then proceed to the quantitative impairment testing.\nWe compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nWhen required, we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology which includes estimates of future cash flows to be generated by a component where the goodwill is recorded, as well as determining a discount rate to measure the present value of those anticipated cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and includes making assumptions about projected growth rates, industry-specific factors, working capital requirements, weighted average cost of capital, and current and anticipated operating conditions. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different results.\nIntangible assets represent both indefinite lived and definite lived assets. Acquired accreditation and regulatory approvals and Trade name and trademarks are deemed to have indefinite useful lives and accordingly are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment. Student relationships and curriculums are deemed to have definite lives and are amortized accordingly.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is expensed over the requisite service period, which is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. For employee stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeiture rates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. For non-employee stock-based awards, the Company follows ASU 2018-7, which substantially aligns share based compensation for employees and non-employees.\nRSUs are awards in the form of shares denominated in the equivalent number of shares of ASPU common stock and with the value of each RSU being equal to the fair value of ASPU common stock at the date of grant. RSU awards may be subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests and/or other vesting restrictions based on the nature and recipient of the award. For RSU awards, the expense is typically measured at the grant date as the fair value of ASPU common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term, which is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company did not have any related party transactions in fiscal year 2021.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of April 30, 2021.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our continuing focus on the nursing profession, the expected changes in our business plan in fiscal year 2022, including the anticipated changes in the advertising spend, enrollments and bookings in fiscal year 2022, our goal of achieving positive GAAP net income by Q4 of the fiscal year 2022, the timing of launching phase two of our in-house CRM and the expected impact of its implementation on our operations, persistence rates and LTV, our beliefs with respect to our student acquisition costs and faculty cost model, the future potential of our BSN Pre-Licensure Program, the future job opportunities for licensed practical nurses and registered nurses, future competitive trends in our industry, including increased competition as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our leads acquisition strategy and the expected sources of leads, our future ability to provide lower costs per enrollment, our estimates concerning LTV and ARPU, the expected revenue run rate per annum following the implementation of double cohort enrollments at the Phoenix main campus, our estimates with respect to the adequacy of our bad debt reserves, our expectations regarding future trends in the six-year MPP accounts receivable, the expected continued revenue growth in the BSN Pre-Licensure and USU businesses as a percentage of total revenues and the expected impact thereof on our accounts receivable, allowance for doubtful accounts and cash flow from operations, the expected rate and timing of subsequent campus openings, the impact of bookings, future expansion of our operating margins, the anticipated impact of our enhanced recovery and collections process, our beliefs with respect to the short-term impact of COVID-19 on class starts and enrollments, the expected sources of future revenue growth, our anticipated working capital trends, the expected capital expenditures related to new campus openings and letters of credit, and our future liquidity.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the Risk Factors contained herein.\nKey Terms\nIn connection with the management of our businesses, we identify, measure and assess a variety of operating metrics. The principal metrics we use in managing our businesses are set forth below:\nOperating Metrics\n\u2022Lifetime Value (\"LTV\") - Lifetime Value as the weighted average total amount of tuition and fees paid by every new student that enrolls in the Company's universities, after giving effect to attrition.\n\u2022Bookings - defined by multiplying LTV by new student enrollments for each operating unit.\n\u2022Average Revenue per Enrollment (\"ARPU\") - defined by dividing total bookings by total enrollments for each operating unit.\nOperating costs and expenses\n\u2022Cost of revenues - consists of instructional costs and services and marketing and promotional costs.\n\u25e6Instructional costs - consist primarily of costs related to the administration and delivery of the Company's educational programs. This expense category includes compensation costs associated with online faculty, technology license costs and costs associated with other support groups that provide services directly to the students and are included in cost of revenues.\n\u25e6Marketing and promotional costs - include costs associated with producing marketing materials and advertising, and outside sales costs. Such costs are generally affected by the cost of advertising media, the efficiency of the Company's marketing and recruiting efforts, and expenditures on advertising initiatives for\nnew and existing academic programs. Non-direct response advertising activities are expensed as incurred, or the first time the advertising takes place, depending on the type of advertising activity and are included in cost of revenues.\n\u2022General and administrative expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive and academic management and operations, finance, legal, tax, information technology and human resources, fees for professional services, financial aid processing costs, non-capitalizable courseware and software costs, corporate taxes and facilities costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures:\n\u2022Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") - is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP - Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\u2022Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") - is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP - Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nCompany Overview\nAspen Group, Inc. is an education technology holding company. It operates two universities, Aspen University Inc. (\"Aspen University\") and United States University Inc. (\"United States University\" or \"USU\").\nAll references to the Company\u201d, AGI\u201d, Aspen Group\u201d, we\u201d, our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Aspen Group, Inc., unless the context otherwise indicates.\nAGI leverages its education technology infrastructure and expertise to allow its two universities, Aspen University and United States University, to deliver on the vision of making college affordable again. Because we believe higher education should be a catalyst to our students' long-term economic success, we exert financial prudence by offering affordable tuition that is one of the greatest values in higher education. AGI's primary focus relative to future growth is to target the high growth nursing profession. As of April 30, 2021, 12,046 of 13,886 or 87% of all active students across both universities are degree-seeking nursing students. Of the 12,046 students seeking nursing degrees, 9,664 are Registered Nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree at Aspen University (7,028) and United States University (2,636), while the remaining 2,382 nursing students are enrolled in Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in the Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville metros.\nIn March 2014, Aspen University began offering a monthly payment plan available to all students across every online degree program offered by Aspen University. The monthly payment plan is designed so that students will make one payment per month, and that monthly payment is applied towards the total cost of attendance (tuition and fees, excluding textbooks). The monthly payment plan offers online undergraduate students the opportunity to pay their tuition and fees at $250/month, online master students $325/month, and online doctoral students $375/month, interest free, thereby giving students a monthly payment option versus taking out a federal financial aid loan.\nUSU began offering monthly payment plans in the summer of 2017. Today, monthly payment plans are available for the online RN to BSN program ($250/month), online MBA/MAEd/MSN programs ($325/month), online hybrid Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, Teacher Credentialing tracks approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing ($350/month), and the online hybrid Masters of Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner ( FNP\u201d) program ($375/month).\nSince 1993, Aspen University has been nationally accredited by the DEAC, a national accrediting agency recognized by the DOE and CHEA. On February 25, 2019, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years to January 2024.\nSince 2009, USU has been regionally accredited by WSCUC.\nBoth universities are qualified to participate under the Higher Education Act and the Federal student financial assistance programs (Title IV, HEA programs).\nAGI Student Population Overview\nAGI's overall active student body (includes both Aspen University and USU) grew 21% year-over-year to 13,886 from 11,444 as of April 30, 2021 and students seeking nursing degrees were 12,046 or 87% of total active students at both universities. Of the 12,046 students seeking nursing degrees, 9,664 are Registered Nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree at a Aspen University (7,028) and United States University (2,636), while the remaining 2,382 nursing students are enrolled in Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in the Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville metros.\nAspen University's total active student body increased by 17% year-over-year to 11,117 from 9,487. On a year-over-year basis, USU's total active student body grew by 41% to 2,769 from 1,957. The chart below shows five quarters of active student body results. Active student body is comprised of active degree-seeking students, enrolled in a course at the end of fiscal year 2021 or are registered for an upcoming course.\nAGI New Student Enrollments\nFor the fourth-quarter fiscal year 2021, new student enrollments increased by 23% year-over-year to 2,182. Below is a table reflecting new student enrollments for the past five quarters:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>New Student Enrollments by Quarter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Q4 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Q1 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Q2 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Q3 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Q4 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aspen University </td> <td>1,344 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,779 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,010 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,593 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,593 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>USU </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> <td>572 </td> <td> </td> <td>649 </td> <td> </td> <td>536 </td> <td> </td> <td>589 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,776 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,351 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,659 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,129 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,182 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBookings Analysis and ARPU\nOn a year-over-year basis, Bookings rose by 29% to $143.4 million from $111.3 million in the prior year.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fourth Quarter Bookings1 and Average Revenue Per Enrollment (ARPU)1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>FY '21 Enrollments </td> <td> </td> <td>FY '21 Bookings </td> <td> </td> <td>FY '20 Enrollments </td> <td> </td> <td>FY '20 Bookings </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change Total Bookings & ARPU </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aspen University </td> <td>6,975 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,560,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,953 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,734,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>USU </td> <td>2,346 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,805,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,715 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,561,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>9,321 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,366,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,668 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,295,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARPU </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Bookings\u201d are defined by multiplying Lifetime Value (LTV) by new student enrollments for each operating unit. Average Revenue Per Enrollment\u201d (ARPU) is defined by dividing total Bookings by total new student enrollments for each operating unit.\nThe Company focused its growth capital over the past fiscal year almost exclusively on its two licensure degree programs which have higher lifetime values. Set forth below is the description of these two key licensure degree programs.\nBachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Pre-Licensure Program\nAspen University offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Pre-Licensure degree program (the BSN Pre-Licensure Program\u201d). This innovative hybrid (online/on-campus) program allows most of the credits to be completed online (83 of 120 credits or 69%), with pricing offered at current low tuition rates of $150/credit hour for online general education courses, $325/credit hour for online core nursing courses, and $495 for core clinical courses. For students with no prior college credits, the total cost of attendance is less than $50,000.\nPhoenix, AZ Campus Locations\nAspen University began offering the BSN Pre-Licensure program in July 2018 at its initial campus in Phoenix, Arizona. As a result of overwhelming demand in the Phoenix metropolitan area, in January 2019 Aspen University began offering both day (July, November, March) and evening/weekend (January, May, September) terms, equaling six term starts per year. In September 2019, Aspen University opened a second campus in the Phoenix metropolitan area in partnership with HonorHealth.\nOn the February 2, 2021 semester start date, Aspen University implemented its first double cohort enrollment at its main campus in Phoenix. A total of 57 students entered the core BSN-PL program at the Main Campus, in two cohorts of 29 and 28, respectively. Additionally, 29 students entered the program at the HonorHealth campus, bringing the total two-year core program semester starts in February, 2021 to 86 students, an increase of over 70% from the prior year period for this program in the Phoenix metro. Aspen University implements six semester start dates per annum in Arizona. With the introduction of double cohorts at its main campus in Phoenix, the university is now on pace to start approximately 500 students per annum in the Phoenix metro into the final two-year core program, up from the prior run rate of approximately 300 students. Given the revenue per student for the final two-year core program is approximately $20,000 per annum, that equates to an approximate $10 million revenue run rate per annum in the Phoenix metro, up from approximately $6 million with single cohorts, excluding revenues earned from over approximately 1,300 first-year online pre-requisite students currently enrolled in the Phoenix metro.\nBSN Pre-Licensure Campus Locations Opened in Fiscal Year 2020 - First Half of Fiscal Year 2021\nAustin, TX\nAspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in Austin is based in the Frontera Crossing office building located at 101 W. Louis Henna Boulevard in the suburb of Round Rock. The building is situated at the junction of Interstate 35 and State Highway 45, one of the most heavily trafficked freeway exchanges in the metropolitan area with visibility to approximately 143,362 cars per day. Aspen University's initial PPN nursing student enrollments began on the September 29, 2020 semester start date.\nAspen University has executed a clinical affiliation agreement with Baylor Scott & White Health - Central division, the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas and one of the largest in the United States. Baylor Scott & White Health includes 48 hospitals, more than 800 patient care sites, more than 7,800 active physicians, over 47,000 employees and the Scott & White Health Plan.\nTampa, FL\nAspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in Tampa is located at 12802 Tampa Oaks Boulevard. The building is visible from the intersection of Interstate 75 and East Fletcher Avenue, near the University of South Florida, providing visibility to approximately 126,500 cars per day. Aspen University's initial PPN nursing student enrollments began on the December 8, 2020 semester start date.\nAspen University has executed a clinical affiliation agreement with Bayfront Health, a regional network of seven hospitals and over 1,900 staff medical professionals serving the residents of the Tampa Bay area to provide required clinical placements for its nursing students. In addition, clinical affiliation agreements have been signed in the Tampa metropolitan area with John Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Inc., Care Connections at Home, Global Nurse Network, LLC and The American National Red Cross.\nNashville, TN Campus\nOn March 8, 2021, the Company announced that Aspen University received the final required state and board of registered nursing regulatory approvals for their new BSN Pre-Licensure campus location in Nashville, Tennessee, with permission to commence marketing and begin to enroll first-year PPN students effective immediately. Aspen University is targeting to begin its initial (years 2-3) core program semester in Nashville in October, 2021.\nThe Nashville campus will be located at 1809 Dabbs Avenue, which is situated right on Interstate 40 east of downtown Nashville, four miles west of the Nashville airport. Clinical affiliation agreements have been executed with NorthCrest Medical Center, Trust Point Hospital, and Nashville General Hospital, among others.\nUSU Master of Science in Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner (MSN-FNP)\nUSU offers a number of nursing degree programs and other degree programs in health sciences, business & technology and education. Its primary enrollment program is its MSN-FNP which is designed for BSN-prepared registered nurses who are seeking a Nurse Practitioner license. The MSN-FNP is an online-hybrid 50-credit degree program with 100% of the curriculum online, including the curricular component to complete 540 clinical and 32 lab hours.\nWhile MSN-FNP lab hours have been done at USU's San Diego facility through the end of calendar 2020, the rapid growth of the MSN-FNP program has caused AGI to open two additional immersion locations in 2021. Specifically, the Company built-out an additional suite on the ground floor of our main facility in Phoenix (by the airport) and recently opened the Tampa clinical facility. Consequently, students now have the option to attend their weekend immersions at three different metro locations: San Diego, Phoenix and Tampa.\nOn July 7, 2020, the Company announced an affiliation partnership with American-Advanced Practice Network (A-APN), a national clinical network for advanced practice nurses that provides comprehensive health care and nursing services at its outpatient centers and clinical facilities throughout the U.S.\nA-APN offers independent nurse practitioners (NPs) a unique, multi-state network or \"group practice without walls\" with best-in-class technology and business support. A-APN was created for and by NPs. Rural and remote members of the network have nationwide, trusted peer cross-coverage for patients. A-APN members deliver clinical care using CareSpan's Digital Care Delivery platform, facilitating care delivery in-person, or at a distance. The platform includes diagnostics, EMR, e-prescribing, remote monitoring, and dynamic documentation.\nThrough this affiliation, A-APN will appoint an Educational Coordinator to work with USU's Office of Field Experience to place USU MSN-FNP students with qualified, experienced NP preceptors. This telehealth partnership enables MSN-FNP students to complete their required direct care clinical hours with A-APN throughout the COVID-19 crisis and thereafter.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN\nThe Company's accounts receivable over the last several years has predominantly been a result of our groundbreaking monthly payment plan (or MPP) which we introduced in 2014 at Aspen University and subsequently in Fiscal Year 2018 at USU.\nSince the beginning of fiscal year 2021, the monthly payment plan accounts receivable balance, both short-term and long-term, has increased by approximately $6.5 million. The attractive aspect of being able to pay for a degree over a fixed period of time has fueled the growth of this plan.\nEach student's receivable account is different depending on how many classes a student takes each period. If a student takes two classes each eight-week period while paying $250, $325 or $375 a month, that student's account receivable balance will rise accordingly.\nThe common thread is the actual monthly payment, which functions as a retail installment contract with no interest that each student commits to pay over a fixed number of months. Aspen University students paying tuition and fees through a monthly payment method grew by 18% year-over-year, from 5,888 to 6,953. Those 6,953 students paying through a monthly payment method represent 63% of Aspen University's total active student body.\nHistorically, we have issued approximately $70 million of credit to Aspen University's MPP students, and to date, we have written off $667,000 or approximately 1% of those accounts receivable. Bad debt reserve for this accounts receivable is currently $2.8 million which we believe is appropriate.\nUSU's MPP accounted for the majority of the Company's increase of accounts receivable this fiscal year. Specifically, the Company's long-term accounts receivable during this fiscal year increased from $6.7 million to $10.2 million with USU accounting for 77% of that increase. The Company's short-term accounts receivable, net, during this fiscal year increased from $14.3 million to $16.7 million with USU accounting for 44% of that increase. In addition to the Company's experience with the FNP students, these people generally earn more than $100,000 per year which reduces the collection risk.\nWhile the majority of the accounts receivable increase for the Company in the past year has been through issuing credit to Nurse Practitioner students at USU, the collection history of these FNP students is tracking materially better than the Company's collection history of Aspen University MPP students. From 2018 to 2019, the Company issued approximately $17 million of credit to USU FNP students on the six year payment plan. As of April 30, 2021, the Company has collected to date approximately $8 million of that $17 million, so the remaining accounts receivable is approximately $8.7 million.\nThe total student count that makes up the $8.7 million of USU FNP MPP student accounts receivable is approximately 750 students; 45% of those students have graduated, while 39% remain active students today in the university, and the remaining 16% are no longer enrolled. Of those students, the Company currently has 25 students that have not made a recent monthly payment which accounts for total accounts receivable of $174,000 or 1.0% of the total credit issued to date. We believe the 6-year MPP accounts receivable will perform materially better than Aspen University's MPP history which has performed well to date.\nChange in Business Mix and Relationship to Accounts Receivable\nDuring fiscal year 2021 revenue from students using the Monthly Payment Plan increased by approximately 19% year over year, but declined as a percentage of total revenue for the third year in a row down from 57.2% in 2020 to 49.5% in 2021, while total revenue increased 38% year over year.\nOur highest lifetime value business unit is Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure business. This is our fastest growing business unit and now represents 21% of total annual revenue. We expect the revenue from this unit to continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenue as we continue to expand our campus footprint from 4 to over 12 campuses over the next 5 years.\nThis change in our business mix is expected to have a meaningful impact on our accounts receivable and our allowance for doubtful accounts. The BSN Pre-Licensure program requires payment prior to the start of each term. This means that nearly 100% of all revenue from this program will be paid in advance; meaningfully reducing our accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of our total revenue.\nAs revenue from this program continues to grow as a percentage of overall revenue, we expect that we will see a corresponding increase in our cash flows from operations that in turn will allow AGI to turn cash flow positive and generate positive free cash flow over time.\nIn addition to this change in our business mix, we continue to evolve the analysis of our accounts receivable and expanded our analysis to include evaluation of all payment types, student status, and aging within programs. As we upgrade our financial systems we expect to gain greater ability to track discrete data faster and easier to support more proactive student engagement that we believe will improve the performance of our student receivable portfolio.\nAs we identify program and student status specific trends, we will strive to create ways to isolate program specific revenue and accounts receivable activity to gather, analyze and report program specific data and trends. Over time, we will use this knowledge to enhance our allowance reserving policies going forward.\nBy improving visibility into trends earlier we expect to see improvement in overall student performance and a reduction of account delinquencies.\nReserving for Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Charges to the Allowance\nAs part of the account receivable analysis discussed earlier, we evaluated our long-term MPP and other payment type student receivables. The analysis evaluated students in two categories: nursing and non-nursing. Based on our analysis of the payment details and student performance, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we charged $76,000 of MPP receivables against the reserve for doubtful accounts. The MPP receivables will be evaluated in conjunction with our updated recovery and collection process and we expect results to be positive. For fiscal year 2021, no changes to the methodology were made and approximately\n$740,000 of student accounts receivable were written off. The Company continues to review accounts receivable for reasonableness.\nOur accounts receivable remaining for former students are from 2018 or more recent with the exception of certain alumni from our nursing programs. We believe our analysis is appropriate and reasonable. We further believe that we are positioned to focus our enhanced recovery and collections efforts on delinquencies and past due amounts from recent graduates and current enrolled students.\nBased on our review of accounts receivable, overall revenue growth trends and changes in our mix of business, we evaluated our reserve methodology and increased our reserve through a charge to bad debt by $340,000 for Aspen University and by $226,540 for USU also in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Note that AGI's bad debt allowance started the year at $1.759 million and ended the year at $3.290 million.\nAs part of the process of evaluating our reserving methodology we also evaluated our processes in student accounts, our accounts receivable recovery and collections processes. We have designed an enhanced recovery and collections process that is expected to begin recovery of student late payments earlier and manage these students more proactively during their course of study and post-graduation for MPP students\nWe will continue to reserve against our receivables based on revenue growth trends, mix of business and specific trends we identify on a program by program basis. We believe we currently have sufficient reserves against our current student portfolio but we intend to stay vigilant to become aware of external changes that could affect our students ability to meet their obligations such as the continuation of the COVID-19 economic slowdown or other external events and circumstances that could give us reason to make a material change to our current methodology and reserve policy.\nOver time we expect the change in our mix of business together with process improvements and collection enhancements to result in a better managed portfolio of student receivables and improving cash flow from operations.\nRelationship Between Accounts Receivable and Revenue\nThe gross accounts receivable balance for any period is the net effect of the following three factors:\n1.Revenue;\n2.Cash receipts, and;\n3.The net change in deferred revenue.\nAll three factors equally determine the gross accounts receivable. If one quarter experiences particularly high cash receipts, the gross accounts receivable will go down. The same effect happens if cash receipts are lower or if there are significant changes in either of the other factors.\nSimply looking at the change in revenue does not translate into an equally similar change in gross accounts receivable. The relative change in cash and the deferral must also be considered. For net accounts receivable, the changes in the reserve must also be considered. Any additional reserve or write-offs will influence the balance.\nAs it is a straight mathematical formula for both gross accounts receivable and net accounts receivable, and most of the information is public, one can reasonably calculate the two non-public pieces of information, namely the cash receipts in gross accounts receivable and the write-offs in net accounts receivable.\nFor revenue, the quarterly change is primarily billings and the net impact of deferred revenue. The deferral from the prior quarter or year is added to the billings and the deferral at the end of the period is subtracted from the amount billed. The total deferred revenue at the end of every period is reflected in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred revenue can vary for many reasons, but seasonality and the timing of the class starts in relation to the end of the quarter will cause changes in the balance.\nAs mentioned in the accounts receivable discussion above, the change in revenue cannot be compared to the change in accounts receivable. Revenue does not have the impact of cash received whereas accounts receivable does. Depending on the month and the amount of cash received, it is likely that revenue or accounts receivable will increase at a rate different from the other. The impact of cash is easy to substantiate as it agrees to deposits in our bank accounts.\nAt April 30, 2021, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $3,289,816 which represents 11% of the gross accounts receivable balance of $30,264,393, the sum of both short-term and long-term receivables.\nLong-Term Accounts Receivable\nWhen a student signs up for the monthly payment plan, there is a contractual amount that the Company can expect to earn over the life of the student's program. This contractual amount cannot be recorded as an account receivable as the student does have the option to stop attending. As a student takes a class, revenue is earned over that eight-week class. Some students accelerate their program, taking two classes every eight-week period, and as we discussed, that increases the student's accounts receivable balance. If any portion of that balance will be paid in a period greater than 12 months, that portion is reflected as long-term accounts receivable.\nAs a result of the growing acceptance of our monthly payment plans, our long-term accounts receivable balance has grown from $6,701,136 at April 30, 2020 to $10,249,833 at April 30, 2021. These are MPP students who make monthly payments over 36, 39 and 72 months. The average student completes their academic program in 30 months; therefore, most of the Company's accounts receivable are short-term. However, when students graduate earlier than the 30 month average completion duration, they transition to long-term accounts receivable. Those are the two primary factors that have driven an increase in long-term accounts receivable.\nHere is a graphic of both short-term and long-term receivables, as well as contractual value:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A\n</td> <td>B\n</td> <td>C\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments owed for classes taken where payment plans for classes are less than 12 months, less monthly payments received </td> <td>Payments owed for classes taken where payment plans are greater than 12 months </td> <td>Expected classes\nto be taken over\nbalance of program. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term\nAccounts Receivable\n</td> <td>Long-term\nAccounts Receivable\n</td> <td>Not recorded in\nfinancial statements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nThe Sum of A, B and C will equal the total cost of the program.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOVID-19 Update\nNursing students represented 87% or 12,046 of the Company's total student body of 13,886 students at fiscal year-end 2021. Of the 12,046 nursing students, 2,382 are BSN Pre-Licensure students located across our four metro locations (Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville). The remaining 9,664 nursing students are licensed registered nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree (RN to BSN, MSN or DNP degree programs). These 9,664 post-licensure nursing students therefore represent 70% of the Company's total student body and are the population of AGI students that have been primarily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that AGI has the highest student body concentration of RNs among publicly-traded higher education companies in the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the need to track RN behaviors and attitudes carefully for the past 16 months. Below are the effects the Company has seen to date relative to class starts and enrollments.\nThe Company previously reported that RN course starts at both universities were approximately 4% lower than historically expected during the months of September, 2020 - January, 2021, which resulted in approximately $520,000 less revenues in the fiscal third quarter. However, beginning in late February 2021, RN course starts returned to historically normal levels throughout the remainder of the fourth fiscal quarter which resulted in revenues of $19.1 million for the quarter, approximately $500,000 higher than the midpoint of our previous forecast.\nThe Company's fiscal first quarter has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter among our RN student body given it falls during the late-spring/summer months, and thus far in the quarter (May and June) we are seeing lower inquiries, conversion rates and enrollments among prospective RN students than expected, which we believe is due to RNs \u2018taking a deep breath' and taking time off with their families now that vaccination rates and hospitalizations have materially improved. The Company is also seeing lower course starts in the first quarter than seasonally expected among its RN student body. We believe this will be a short-lived \u2018summer break' slowdown, with a return to normalized enrollment and course start levels in our second fiscal quarter (August - October).\nResults of Operations\nFor the Three Months Ended April 30, 2021 Compared to the Three Months Ended April 30, 2020 and Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2020\nRevenue\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Q4 2021\") compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Q4 2020\")\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$19,051,076 </td> <td> </td> <td>$4,971,883 </td> <td> </td> <td>35% </td> <td> </td> <td>$14,079,193 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from operations for Fiscal Q4 2021 increased to $19,051,076 from $14,079,193 for Fiscal Q4 2020, an increase of $4,971,883 or 35%. The increase was primarily due to enrollment and student body growth in USU's MSN-FNP and Aspen's BSN Pre-Licensure program, the degree programs with the highest lifetime value (LTV).

Without these items, the net loss increase would have been approximately $2.2 million. This $2.2 million increase in net loss year-over-year is primarily a result of the new campus costs at Aspen University (approximately $1.6 million) and CFO transition costs disclosed above.\nNon-GAAP - Financial Measures\nThis discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss), and cash flow from operating activities, liquidity or any other financial measures. They may not be\nindicative of the historical operating results of AGI nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOur management uses and relies on EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that management, analysts and shareholders benefit from referring to the following non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of items that affect comparability. Our management recognizes that the non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations because of the excluded items described below.\nWe have included a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between AGI and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measure and the corresponding GAAP measure provided by each company under applicable SEC rules.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nAGI defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding: (1) bad debt expense; (2) stock-based compensation; and (3) non-recurring charges.

Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation, bad debt expense, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of debt discounts and issue costs, warrants issued for services, modification charge for warrants exercised, common shares issued for services and other adjustments.\nAdjustments to net loss consist primarily of tenant improvement allowances received from landlords of $4,685,826, stock-based compensation of $3,958,085, depreciation and amortization expense of $2,426,365, bad debt expense of $2,268,540, and amortization of debt discounts of $1,550,854. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consists of increases in deferred revenue of $3,112,020 and accrued expenses of $1,140,253, partially offset by increases in gross accounts receivable (both short and long term accounts receivable, before allowance for doubtful accounts) of $8,215,190. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to timing of billings for class starts. Accrued expenses increased due primarily to accrual of executive bonus for Fiscal 2021, accrued payroll due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense to support the growth of the business and an increase in accrued marketing due to timing. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to the growth in revenues from increased enrollments and students paying through the monthly payment plan as well as timing of billings for class starts.\nThe Company expects a favorable trend in working capital over time, but there may be volatility from quarter to quarter. In aggregate the Company expects a general trend toward lower cash used in operations in future quarters; however, some quarters could have higher cash used in operations as a result of more cash used to support changes in working capital. Program start timings and the related federal financial aid drawdowns also impact cash timing.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended April 30, 2020 consist primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of $2,203,461, stock-based compensation of $2,116,309 and bad debt expense of $1,431,210. The increase from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in gross accounts receivable (both short and long term accounts receivable, before allowance for doubtful accounts) of $8,717,424, partially offset by increases in deferred revenue of $1,256,129 and $1,197,343 due to students. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to the growth in revenues from increased enrollments and students paying through the monthly payment plan as well as timing of billings for class starts. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to timing of billings for class starts.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 includes purchases of property and equipment of $8,848,395 primarily due to investments in leasehold improvements, computer equipment and hardware, Company developed software and new campuses; purchases of courseware and accreditation of $120,408 and purchase of a domain name of $8,500.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended April 30, 2020 includes purchases of property and equipment of $3,276,510 primarily due to investments in Company developed software, computer equipment and hardware, instructional equipment and new campuses; and purchases of courseware and accreditation of $13,851.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 includes proceeds from stock options exercised of $2,669,247 and proceeds from warrants exercised of $1,081,792 received from the cash exercise of warrants associated with the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2020 includes proceeds from the sale of common stock, net of underwriter costs of $16,044,879; proceeds from stock options exercised of $962,650; and a common stock short swing reclamation of $21,760, partially offset by $51,282 of disbursements for equity offering costs.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAt July 9, 2021, the Company had cash deposits of approximately $12.1 million, including $4.1 million of restricted cash. Our cash balances are kept liquid to support our growing infrastructure needs. The majority of our cash is concentrated in large financial institutions.\nThe Company also has access to a $5 million Revolving Credit Facility. At April 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility.\nThe Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its campus operations. The Company's Fiscal year 2022 capital expenditures are expected to be lower than Fiscal Year 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $0.5 million related to new campus costs. Additionally, the Company expects additional cash commitments for letters of credits related to securing new campus locations.\nThe Company expects that its existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund its working capital, including capital expenditures, investing and other needs for more than the next 12 months. As disclosed earlier in this Report, the Company intends to be net income positive by Fiscal Q4 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn response to financial reporting release FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, from the SEC, we have selected our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on our financial condition. There were no material changes to our principal accounting estimates during the period covered by this report.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nRevenue consisting primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught by Aspen online as well as from related educational resources that Aspen provides to its students, such as access to our online materials and learning management system. Tuition revenue is recognized pro-rata over the applicable period of instruction. Aspen maintains an institutional tuition refund policy, which provides for all or a portion of tuition to be refunded if a student withdraws during stated refund periods. Certain states in which students reside impose separate, mandatory refund policies, which override Aspen's policy to the extent in conflict. If a student withdraws at a time when a portion or none of the tuition is refundable, then in accordance with its revenue recognition policy, Aspen recognizes as revenue the tuition that was not refunded. Since Aspen recognizes revenue pro-rata over the term of the course and because, under its institutional refund policy, the amount subject to refund is never greater than the amount of the revenue that has been deferred, under Aspen's accounting policies revenue is not recognized with respect to amounts that could potentially be refunded. Aspen's educational programs have starting and ending dates that differ from its fiscal quarters. Therefore, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a portion of revenue from these programs is not yet earned and is therefore deferred. Aspen also charges students annual fees for library, technology and other services, which are recognized over the related service period. Deferred revenue represents the amount of tuition, fees, and other student payments received in excess of the portion recognized as revenue and it is included in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Other revenue may be recognized as sales occur or services are performed.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nAll students are required to select both a primary and secondary payment option with respect to amounts due to Aspen for tuition, fees and other expenses. The most common payment option for Aspen's students is personal funds or payment made on their behalf by an employer. In instances where a student selects financial aid as the primary payment option, he or she often selects personal cash as the secondary option. If a student who has selected financial aid as his or her primary payment option withdraws prior to the end of a course but after the date that Aspen's institutional refund period has expired, the student will have incurred the obligation to pay the full cost of the course. If the withdrawal occurs before the date at which the student has earned 100% of his or her financial aid, Aspen will have to return all or a portion of the Title IV funds to the DOE and the student will owe Aspen all amounts incurred that are in excess of the amount of financial aid that the student earned and that Aspen is entitled to retain. In this case, Aspen must collect the receivable using the student's second payment option.\nFor accounts receivable from students, Aspen records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of its students to make required payments, which includes the recovery of financial aid funds advanced to a student for amounts in excess of the student's cost of tuition and related fees. Aspen determines the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts using a general reserve method based on an analysis of its historical bad debt experience, current economic trends, and the aging of the accounts receivable and student status. AGI establishes reserves to its receivables based upon an estimate of the risk presented by the program within the university, student status, payment type and age of receivables. Aspen writes off accounts receivable balances at the time the balances are deemed uncollectible. Aspen continues to reflect accounts receivable with an offsetting allowance as long as management believes there is a reasonable possibility of collection.\nFor accounts receivable from primary payors other than students, Aspen estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations, such as bankruptcy proceedings and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond contractual terms. In these cases, Aspen uses assumptions and judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances, to record a specific allowance for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These specific allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. The amounts calculated are analyzed to determine the total amount of the allowance. Aspen may also record a general allowance as necessary.\nDirect write-offs are taken in the period when Aspen has exhausted its efforts to collect overdue and unpaid receivables or otherwise evaluate other circumstances that indicate that Aspen should abandon such efforts.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the 2017 acquisition of USU. Goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested annually as of April 30 for impairment.\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04: \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)\u201d - to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2\nfrom the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company early adopted this standard effective April 30, 2018. We have selected an April 30 annual goodwill impairment test date.\nWhen evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, management first assesses a range of qualitative factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and the overall financial performance for each of the Company's reporting units. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then proceed to the quantitative impairment testing.\nWe compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nWhen required, we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology which includes estimates of future cash flows to be generated by a component where the goodwill is recorded, as well as determining a discount rate to measure the present value of those anticipated cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and includes making assumptions about projected growth rates, industry-specific factors, working capital requirements, weighted average cost of capital, and current and anticipated operating conditions. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different results.\nIntangible assets represent both indefinite lived and definite lived assets. Acquired accreditation and regulatory approvals and Trade name and trademarks are deemed to have indefinite useful lives and accordingly are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment. Student relationships and curriculums are deemed to have definite lives and are amortized accordingly.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is expensed over the requisite service period, which is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. For employee stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeiture rates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. For non-employee stock-based awards, the Company follows ASU 2018-7, which substantially aligns share based compensation for employees and non-employees.\nRSUs are awards in the form of shares denominated in the equivalent number of shares of ASPU common stock and with the value of each RSU being equal to the fair value of ASPU common stock at the date of grant. RSU awards may be subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests and/or other vesting restrictions based on the nature and recipient of the award. For RSU awards, the expense is typically measured at the grant date as the fair value of ASPU common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term, which is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company did not have any related party transactions in fiscal year 2021.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of April 30, 2021.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our continuing focus on the nursing profession, the expected changes in our business plan in fiscal year 2022, including the anticipated changes in the advertising spend, enrollments and bookings in fiscal year 2022, our goal of achieving positive GAAP net income by Q4 of the fiscal year 2022, the timing of launching phase two of our in-house CRM and the expected impact of its implementation on our operations, persistence rates and LTV, our beliefs with respect to our student acquisition costs and faculty cost model, the future potential of our BSN Pre-Licensure Program, the future job opportunities for licensed practical nurses and registered nurses, future competitive trends in our industry, including increased competition as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our leads acquisition strategy and the expected sources of leads, our future ability to provide lower costs per enrollment, our estimates concerning LTV and ARPU, the expected revenue run rate per annum following the implementation of double cohort enrollments at the Phoenix main campus, our estimates with respect to the adequacy of our bad debt reserves, our expectations regarding future trends in the six-year MPP accounts receivable, the expected continued revenue growth in the BSN Pre-Licensure and USU businesses as a percentage of total revenues and the expected impact thereof on our accounts receivable, allowance for doubtful accounts and cash flow from operations, the expected rate and timing of subsequent campus openings, the impact of bookings, future expansion of our operating margins, the anticipated impact of our enhanced recovery and collections process, our beliefs with respect to the short-term impact of COVID-19 on class starts and enrollments, the expected sources of future revenue growth, our anticipated working capital trends, the expected capital expenditures related to new campus openings and letters of credit, and our future liquidity.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the Risk Factors contained herein.\nKey Terms\nIn connection with the management of our businesses, we identify, measure and assess a variety of operating metrics. The principal metrics we use in managing our businesses are set forth below:\nOperating Metrics\n\u2022Lifetime Value (\"LTV\") - Lifetime Value as the weighted average total amount of tuition and fees paid by every new student that enrolls in the Company's universities, after giving effect to attrition.\n\u2022Bookings - defined by multiplying LTV by new student enrollments for each operating unit.\n\u2022Average Revenue per Enrollment (\"ARPU\") - defined by dividing total bookings by total enrollments for each operating unit.\nOperating costs and expenses\n\u2022Cost of revenues - consists of instructional costs and services and marketing and promotional costs.\n\u25e6Instructional costs - consist primarily of costs related to the administration and delivery of the Company's educational programs. This expense category includes compensation costs associated with online faculty, technology license costs and costs associated with other support groups that provide services directly to the students and are included in cost of revenues.\n\u25e6Marketing and promotional costs - include costs associated with producing marketing materials and advertising, and outside sales costs. Such costs are generally affected by the cost of advertising media, the efficiency of the Company's marketing and recruiting efforts, and expenditures on advertising initiatives for\nnew and existing academic programs. Non-direct response advertising activities are expensed as incurred, or the first time the advertising takes place, depending on the type of advertising activity and are included in cost of revenues.\n\u2022General and administrative expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive and academic management and operations, finance, legal, tax, information technology and human resources, fees for professional services, financial aid processing costs, non-capitalizable courseware and software costs, corporate taxes and facilities costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures:\n\u2022Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") - is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP - Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\u2022Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") - is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP - Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nCompany Overview\nAspen Group, Inc. is an education technology holding company. It operates two universities, Aspen University Inc. (\"Aspen University\") and United States University Inc. (\"United States University\" or \"USU\").\nAll references to the Company\u201d, AGI\u201d, Aspen Group\u201d, we\u201d, our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Aspen Group, Inc., unless the context otherwise indicates.\nAGI leverages its education technology infrastructure and expertise to allow its two universities, Aspen University and United States University, to deliver on the vision of making college affordable again. Because we believe higher education should be a catalyst to our students' long-term economic success, we exert financial prudence by offering affordable tuition that is one of the greatest values in higher education. AGI's primary focus relative to future growth is to target the high growth nursing profession. As of April 30, 2021, 12,046 of 13,886 or 87% of all active students across both universities are degree-seeking nursing students. Of the 12,046 students seeking nursing degrees, 9,664 are Registered Nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree at Aspen University (7,028) and United States University (2,636), while the remaining 2,382 nursing students are enrolled in Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in the Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville metros.\nIn March 2014, Aspen University began offering a monthly payment plan available to all students across every online degree program offered by Aspen University. The monthly payment plan is designed so that students will make one payment per month, and that monthly payment is applied towards the total cost of attendance (tuition and fees, excluding textbooks). The monthly payment plan offers online undergraduate students the opportunity to pay their tuition and fees at $250/month, online master students $325/month, and online doctoral students $375/month, interest free, thereby giving students a monthly payment option versus taking out a federal financial aid loan.\nUSU began offering monthly payment plans in the summer of 2017. Today, monthly payment plans are available for the online RN to BSN program ($250/month), online MBA/MAEd/MSN programs ($325/month), online hybrid Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, Teacher Credentialing tracks approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing ($350/month), and the online hybrid Masters of Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner ( FNP\u201d) program ($375/month).\nSince 1993, Aspen University has been nationally accredited by the DEAC, a national accrediting agency recognized by the DOE and CHEA. On February 25, 2019, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years to January 2024.\nSince 2009, USU has been regionally accredited by WSCUC.\nBoth universities are qualified to participate under the Higher Education Act and the Federal student financial assistance programs (Title IV, HEA programs).\nAGI Student Population Overview\nAGI's overall active student body (includes both Aspen University and USU) grew 21% year-over-year to 13,886 from 11,444 as of April 30, 2021 and students seeking nursing degrees were 12,046 or 87% of total active students at both universities. Of the 12,046 students seeking nursing degrees, 9,664 are Registered Nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree at a Aspen University (7,028) and United States University (2,636), while the remaining 2,382 nursing students are enrolled in Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in the Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville metros.\nAspen University's total active student body increased by 17% year-over-year to 11,117 from 9,487. On a year-over-year basis, USU's total active student body grew by 41% to 2,769 from 1,957. The chart below shows five quarters of active student body results. Active student body is comprised of active degree-seeking students, enrolled in a course at the end of fiscal year 2021 or are registered for an upcoming course.\nAGI New Student Enrollments\nFor the fourth-quarter fiscal year 2021, new student enrollments increased by 23% year-over-year to 2,182. Below is a table reflecting new student enrollments for the past five quarters:\n\nBookings Analysis and ARPU\nOn a year-over-year basis, Bookings rose by 29% to $143.4 million from $111.3 million in the prior year.\n\n1 Bookings\u201d are defined by multiplying Lifetime Value (LTV) by new student enrollments for each operating unit. Average Revenue Per Enrollment\u201d (ARPU) is defined by dividing total Bookings by total new student enrollments for each operating unit.\nThe Company focused its growth capital over the past fiscal year almost exclusively on its two licensure degree programs which have higher lifetime values. Set forth below is the description of these two key licensure degree programs.\nBachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Pre-Licensure Program\nAspen University offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Pre-Licensure degree program (the BSN Pre-Licensure Program\u201d). This innovative hybrid (online/on-campus) program allows most of the credits to be completed online (83 of 120 credits or 69%), with pricing offered at current low tuition rates of $150/credit hour for online general education courses, $325/credit hour for online core nursing courses, and $495 for core clinical courses. For students with no prior college credits, the total cost of attendance is less than $50,000.\nPhoenix, AZ Campus Locations\nAspen University began offering the BSN Pre-Licensure program in July 2018 at its initial campus in Phoenix, Arizona. As a result of overwhelming demand in the Phoenix metropolitan area, in January 2019 Aspen University began offering both day (July, November, March) and evening/weekend (January, May, September) terms, equaling six term starts per year. In September 2019, Aspen University opened a second campus in the Phoenix metropolitan area in partnership with HonorHealth.\nOn the February 2, 2021 semester start date, Aspen University implemented its first double cohort enrollment at its main campus in Phoenix. A total of 57 students entered the core BSN-PL program at the Main Campus, in two cohorts of 29 and 28, respectively. Additionally, 29 students entered the program at the HonorHealth campus, bringing the total two-year core program semester starts in February, 2021 to 86 students, an increase of over 70% from the prior year period for this program in the Phoenix metro. Aspen University implements six semester start dates per annum in Arizona. With the introduction of double cohorts at its main campus in Phoenix, the university is now on pace to start approximately 500 students per annum in the Phoenix metro into the final two-year core program, up from the prior run rate of approximately 300 students. Given the revenue per student for the final two-year core program is approximately $20,000 per annum, that equates to an approximate $10 million revenue run rate per annum in the Phoenix metro, up from approximately $6 million with single cohorts, excluding revenues earned from over approximately 1,300 first-year online pre-requisite students currently enrolled in the Phoenix metro.\nBSN Pre-Licensure Campus Locations Opened in Fiscal Year 2020 - First Half of Fiscal Year 2021\nAustin, TX\nAspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in Austin is based in the Frontera Crossing office building located at 101 W. Louis Henna Boulevard in the suburb of Round Rock. The building is situated at the junction of Interstate 35 and State Highway 45, one of the most heavily trafficked freeway exchanges in the metropolitan area with visibility to approximately 143,362 cars per day. Aspen University's initial PPN nursing student enrollments began on the September 29, 2020 semester start date.\nAspen University has executed a clinical affiliation agreement with Baylor Scott & White Health - Central division, the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas and one of the largest in the United States. Baylor Scott & White Health includes 48 hospitals, more than 800 patient care sites, more than 7,800 active physicians, over 47,000 employees and the Scott & White Health Plan.\nTampa, FL\nAspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program in Tampa is located at 12802 Tampa Oaks Boulevard. The building is visible from the intersection of Interstate 75 and East Fletcher Avenue, near the University of South Florida, providing visibility to approximately 126,500 cars per day. Aspen University's initial PPN nursing student enrollments began on the December 8, 2020 semester start date.\nAspen University has executed a clinical affiliation agreement with Bayfront Health, a regional network of seven hospitals and over 1,900 staff medical professionals serving the residents of the Tampa Bay area to provide required clinical placements for its nursing students. In addition, clinical affiliation agreements have been signed in the Tampa metropolitan area with John Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Inc., Care Connections at Home, Global Nurse Network, LLC and The American National Red Cross.\nNashville, TN Campus\nOn March 8, 2021, the Company announced that Aspen University received the final required state and board of registered nursing regulatory approvals for their new BSN Pre-Licensure campus location in Nashville, Tennessee, with permission to commence marketing and begin to enroll first-year PPN students effective immediately. Aspen University is targeting to begin its initial (years 2-3) core program semester in Nashville in October, 2021.\nThe Nashville campus will be located at 1809 Dabbs Avenue, which is situated right on Interstate 40 east of downtown Nashville, four miles west of the Nashville airport. Clinical affiliation agreements have been executed with NorthCrest Medical Center, Trust Point Hospital, and Nashville General Hospital, among others.\nUSU Master of Science in Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner (MSN-FNP)\nUSU offers a number of nursing degree programs and other degree programs in health sciences, business & technology and education. Its primary enrollment program is its MSN-FNP which is designed for BSN-prepared registered nurses who are seeking a Nurse Practitioner license. The MSN-FNP is an online-hybrid 50-credit degree program with 100% of the curriculum online, including the curricular component to complete 540 clinical and 32 lab hours.\nWhile MSN-FNP lab hours have been done at USU's San Diego facility through the end of calendar 2020, the rapid growth of the MSN-FNP program has caused AGI to open two additional immersion locations in 2021. Specifically, the Company built-out an additional suite on the ground floor of our main facility in Phoenix (by the airport) and recently opened the Tampa clinical facility. Consequently, students now have the option to attend their weekend immersions at three different metro locations: San Diego, Phoenix and Tampa.\nOn July 7, 2020, the Company announced an affiliation partnership with American-Advanced Practice Network (A-APN), a national clinical network for advanced practice nurses that provides comprehensive health care and nursing services at its outpatient centers and clinical facilities throughout the U.S.\nA-APN offers independent nurse practitioners (NPs) a unique, multi-state network or \"group practice without walls\" with best-in-class technology and business support. A-APN was created for and by NPs. Rural and remote members of the network have nationwide, trusted peer cross-coverage for patients. A-APN members deliver clinical care using CareSpan's Digital Care Delivery platform, facilitating care delivery in-person, or at a distance. The platform includes diagnostics, EMR, e-prescribing, remote monitoring, and dynamic documentation.\nThrough this affiliation, A-APN will appoint an Educational Coordinator to work with USU's Office of Field Experience to place USU MSN-FNP students with qualified, experienced NP preceptors. This telehealth partnership enables MSN-FNP students to complete their required direct care clinical hours with A-APN throughout the COVID-19 crisis and thereafter.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN\nThe Company's accounts receivable over the last several years has predominantly been a result of our groundbreaking monthly payment plan (or MPP) which we introduced in 2014 at Aspen University and subsequently in Fiscal Year 2018 at USU.\nSince the beginning of fiscal year 2021, the monthly payment plan accounts receivable balance, both short-term and long-term, has increased by approximately $6.5 million. The attractive aspect of being able to pay for a degree over a fixed period of time has fueled the growth of this plan.\nEach student's receivable account is different depending on how many classes a student takes each period. If a student takes two classes each eight-week period while paying $250, $325 or $375 a month, that student's account receivable balance will rise accordingly.\nThe common thread is the actual monthly payment, which functions as a retail installment contract with no interest that each student commits to pay over a fixed number of months. Aspen University students paying tuition and fees through a monthly payment method grew by 18% year-over-year, from 5,888 to 6,953. Those 6,953 students paying through a monthly payment method represent 63% of Aspen University's total active student body.\nHistorically, we have issued approximately $70 million of credit to Aspen University's MPP students, and to date, we have written off $667,000 or approximately 1% of those accounts receivable. Bad debt reserve for this accounts receivable is currently $2.8 million which we believe is appropriate.\nUSU's MPP accounted for the majority of the Company's increase of accounts receivable this fiscal year. Specifically, the Company's long-term accounts receivable during this fiscal year increased from $6.7 million to $10.2 million with USU accounting for 77% of that increase. The Company's short-term accounts receivable, net, during this fiscal year increased from $14.3 million to $16.7 million with USU accounting for 44% of that increase. In addition to the Company's experience with the FNP students, these people generally earn more than $100,000 per year which reduces the collection risk.\nWhile the majority of the accounts receivable increase for the Company in the past year has been through issuing credit to Nurse Practitioner students at USU, the collection history of these FNP students is tracking materially better than the Company's collection history of Aspen University MPP students. From 2018 to 2019, the Company issued approximately $17 million of credit to USU FNP students on the six year payment plan. As of April 30, 2021, the Company has collected to date approximately $8 million of that $17 million, so the remaining accounts receivable is approximately $8.7 million.\nThe total student count that makes up the $8.7 million of USU FNP MPP student accounts receivable is approximately 750 students; 45% of those students have graduated, while 39% remain active students today in the university, and the remaining 16% are no longer enrolled. Of those students, the Company currently has 25 students that have not made a recent monthly payment which accounts for total accounts receivable of $174,000 or 1.0% of the total credit issued to date. We believe the 6-year MPP accounts receivable will perform materially better than Aspen University's MPP history which has performed well to date.\nChange in Business Mix and Relationship to Accounts Receivable\nDuring fiscal year 2021 revenue from students using the Monthly Payment Plan increased by approximately 19% year over year, but declined as a percentage of total revenue for the third year in a row down from 57.2% in 2020 to 49.5% in 2021, while total revenue increased 38% year over year.\nOur highest lifetime value business unit is Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure business. This is our fastest growing business unit and now represents 21% of total annual revenue. We expect the revenue from this unit to continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenue as we continue to expand our campus footprint from 4 to over 12 campuses over the next 5 years.\nThis change in our business mix is expected to have a meaningful impact on our accounts receivable and our allowance for doubtful accounts. The BSN Pre-Licensure program requires payment prior to the start of each term. This means that nearly 100% of all revenue from this program will be paid in advance; meaningfully reducing our accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of our total revenue.\nAs revenue from this program continues to grow as a percentage of overall revenue, we expect that we will see a corresponding increase in our cash flows from operations that in turn will allow AGI to turn cash flow positive and generate positive free cash flow over time.\nIn addition to this change in our business mix, we continue to evolve the analysis of our accounts receivable and expanded our analysis to include evaluation of all payment types, student status, and aging within programs. As we upgrade our financial systems we expect to gain greater ability to track discrete data faster and easier to support more proactive student engagement that we believe will improve the performance of our student receivable portfolio.\nAs we identify program and student status specific trends, we will strive to create ways to isolate program specific revenue and accounts receivable activity to gather, analyze and report program specific data and trends. Over time, we will use this knowledge to enhance our allowance reserving policies going forward.\nBy improving visibility into trends earlier we expect to see improvement in overall student performance and a reduction of account delinquencies.\nReserving for Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Charges to the Allowance\nAs part of the account receivable analysis discussed earlier, we evaluated our long-term MPP and other payment type student receivables. The analysis evaluated students in two categories: nursing and non-nursing. Based on our analysis of the payment details and student performance, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we charged $76,000 of MPP receivables against the reserve for doubtful accounts. The MPP receivables will be evaluated in conjunction with our updated recovery and collection process and we expect results to be positive. For fiscal year 2021, no changes to the methodology were made and approximately\n$740,000 of student accounts receivable were written off. The Company continues to review accounts receivable for reasonableness.\nOur accounts receivable remaining for former students are from 2018 or more recent with the exception of certain alumni from our nursing programs. We believe our analysis is appropriate and reasonable. We further believe that we are positioned to focus our enhanced recovery and collections efforts on delinquencies and past due amounts from recent graduates and current enrolled students.\nBased on our review of accounts receivable, overall revenue growth trends and changes in our mix of business, we evaluated our reserve methodology and increased our reserve through a charge to bad debt by $340,000 for Aspen University and by $226,540 for USU also in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Note that AGI's bad debt allowance started the year at $1.759 million and ended the year at $3.290 million.\nAs part of the process of evaluating our reserving methodology we also evaluated our processes in student accounts, our accounts receivable recovery and collections processes. We have designed an enhanced recovery and collections process that is expected to begin recovery of student late payments earlier and manage these students more proactively during their course of study and post-graduation for MPP students\nWe will continue to reserve against our receivables based on revenue growth trends, mix of business and specific trends we identify on a program by program basis. We believe we currently have sufficient reserves against our current student portfolio but we intend to stay vigilant to become aware of external changes that could affect our students ability to meet their obligations such as the continuation of the COVID-19 economic slowdown or other external events and circumstances that could give us reason to make a material change to our current methodology and reserve policy.\nOver time we expect the change in our mix of business together with process improvements and collection enhancements to result in a better managed portfolio of student receivables and improving cash flow from operations.\nRelationship Between Accounts Receivable and Revenue\nThe gross accounts receivable balance for any period is the net effect of the following three factors:\n1.Revenue;\n2.Cash receipts, and;\n3.The net change in deferred revenue.\nAll three factors equally determine the gross accounts receivable. If one quarter experiences particularly high cash receipts, the gross accounts receivable will go down. The same effect happens if cash receipts are lower or if there are significant changes in either of the other factors.\nSimply looking at the change in revenue does not translate into an equally similar change in gross accounts receivable. The relative change in cash and the deferral must also be considered. For net accounts receivable, the changes in the reserve must also be considered. Any additional reserve or write-offs will influence the balance.\nAs it is a straight mathematical formula for both gross accounts receivable and net accounts receivable, and most of the information is public, one can reasonably calculate the two non-public pieces of information, namely the cash receipts in gross accounts receivable and the write-offs in net accounts receivable.\nFor revenue, the quarterly change is primarily billings and the net impact of deferred revenue. The deferral from the prior quarter or year is added to the billings and the deferral at the end of the period is subtracted from the amount billed. The total deferred revenue at the end of every period is reflected in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred revenue can vary for many reasons, but seasonality and the timing of the class starts in relation to the end of the quarter will cause changes in the balance.\nAs mentioned in the accounts receivable discussion above, the change in revenue cannot be compared to the change in accounts receivable. Revenue does not have the impact of cash received whereas accounts receivable does. Depending on the month and the amount of cash received, it is likely that revenue or accounts receivable will increase at a rate different from the other. The impact of cash is easy to substantiate as it agrees to deposits in our bank accounts.\nAt April 30, 2021, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $3,289,816 which represents 11% of the gross accounts receivable balance of $30,264,393, the sum of both short-term and long-term receivables.\nLong-Term Accounts Receivable\nWhen a student signs up for the monthly payment plan, there is a contractual amount that the Company can expect to earn over the life of the student's program. This contractual amount cannot be recorded as an account receivable as the student does have the option to stop attending. As a student takes a class, revenue is earned over that eight-week class. Some students accelerate their program, taking two classes every eight-week period, and as we discussed, that increases the student's accounts receivable balance. If any portion of that balance will be paid in a period greater than 12 months, that portion is reflected as long-term accounts receivable.\nAs a result of the growing acceptance of our monthly payment plans, our long-term accounts receivable balance has grown from $6,701,136 at April 30, 2020 to $10,249,833 at April 30, 2021. These are MPP students who make monthly payments over 36, 39 and 72 months. The average student completes their academic program in 30 months; therefore, most of the Company's accounts receivable are short-term. However, when students graduate earlier than the 30 month average completion duration, they transition to long-term accounts receivable. Those are the two primary factors that have driven an increase in long-term accounts receivable.\nHere is a graphic of both short-term and long-term receivables, as well as contractual value:\n\nCOVID-19 Update\nNursing students represented 87% or 12,046 of the Company's total student body of 13,886 students at fiscal year-end 2021. Of the 12,046 nursing students, 2,382 are BSN Pre-Licensure students located across our four metro locations (Phoenix, Austin, Tampa and Nashville). The remaining 9,664 nursing students are licensed registered nurses (RNs) studying to earn an advanced degree (RN to BSN, MSN or DNP degree programs). These 9,664 post-licensure nursing students therefore represent 70% of the Company's total student body and are the population of AGI students that have been primarily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that AGI has the highest student body concentration of RNs among publicly-traded higher education companies in the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the need to track RN behaviors and attitudes carefully for the past 16 months. Below are the effects the Company has seen to date relative to class starts and enrollments.\nThe Company previously reported that RN course starts at both universities were approximately 4% lower than historically expected during the months of September, 2020 - January, 2021, which resulted in approximately $520,000 less revenues in the fiscal third quarter. However, beginning in late February 2021, RN course starts returned to historically normal levels throughout the remainder of the fourth fiscal quarter which resulted in revenues of $19.1 million for the quarter, approximately $500,000 higher than the midpoint of our previous forecast.\nThe Company's fiscal first quarter has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter among our RN student body given it falls during the late-spring/summer months, and thus far in the quarter (May and June) we are seeing lower inquiries, conversion rates and enrollments among prospective RN students than expected, which we believe is due to RNs \u2018taking a deep breath' and taking time off with their families now that vaccination rates and hospitalizations have materially improved. The Company is also seeing lower course starts in the first quarter than seasonally expected among its RN student body. We believe this will be a short-lived \u2018summer break' slowdown, with a return to normalized enrollment and course start levels in our second fiscal quarter (August - October).\nResults of Operations\nFor the Three Months Ended April 30, 2021 Compared to the Three Months Ended April 30, 2020 and Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2020\nRevenue\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Q4 2021\") compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Q4 2020\")\n\nRevenue from operations for Fiscal Q4 2021 increased to $19,051,076 from $14,079,193 for Fiscal Q4 2020, an increase of $4,971,883 or 35%. The increase was primarily due to enrollment and student body growth in USU's MSN-FNP and Aspen's BSN Pre-Licensure program, the degree programs with the highest lifetime value (LTV). Those two business units accounted for 51% of the Company's revenues in the quarter. The Company expects the majority of its revenue growth in future periods to be derived from these two units as we continue prioritizing our highest LTV degree programs to achieve our long-term growth plans.\nAspen University's traditional post-licensure online nursing + other business unit and doctoral unit contributed the remaining 49% of total Company revenue in Fiscal Q4 2021.\nAspen University's revenues in Fiscal Q4 2021 increased 33% year-over-year, while USU's revenues in Fiscal Q4 2021 increased 40% year-over-year.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Year 2021\") compared to April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Year 2020\")\nIn reviewing our operating results for Fiscal Year 2021, investors should consider our Fiscal 2022 Business Plan Overview\u201d beginning at page one of this Report.\n\nRevenue from operations for the Fiscal Year 2021 increased to $67,812,520 from $49,061,080 for the Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of $18,751,440 or 38%. The increase was primarily due to enrollment and student body growth in USU's MSN-FNP and Aspen's BSN Pre-Licensure program, the degree programs with the highest lifetime value (LTV), partially offset by the reduction in revenue in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2021 as the result of a course start decline resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company expects the majority of its revenue growth in future periods to be derived from these two business units as we continue prioritizing our highest LTV degree programs to achieve our long-term growth plans.\nAspen University's traditional post-licensure online nursing + other business unit and doctoral unit contributed 50% of total Company revenue in Fiscal Year 2021, while Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure program delivered 21% of the Company's revenues in Fiscal Year 2021. Finally, USU contributed 29% of the total revenues for Fiscal Year 2021.\nAspen University's revenues in Fiscal Year 2021 increased 34% year-over-year, while USU's revenues in Fiscal Year 2021 increased 48% year-over-year.\nCost of Revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below)\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020\n\nInstructional Costs and Services\nInstructional costs and services for Fiscal Q4 2021 increased to $4,577,075 or 24% of revenues from $2,691,185 or 19% of revenues for Fiscal Q4 2020, an increase of $1,855,890 or 70%. The increase was partially due to an increase in class starts year-over-year, with the primarily increases resulting from: 1) the hiring of additional full-time faculty staffing in the USU MSN-FNP program, 2) additional faculty staffing to prepare for double cohorts in the main BSN Pre-Licensure campus location in Phoenix, and 3) hiring of new faculty in the recently opened Austin and Tampa campus locations.\nAspen University instructional costs and services represented 24% of Aspen University revenues for Fiscal Q4 2021, while USU instructional costs and services was 25% of USU revenues during Fiscal Q4 2021.\nMarketing and Promotional\nMarketing and promotional costs for Fiscal Q4 2021 were $4,144,404 or 22% of revenues compared to $2,739,997 or 19% of revenues for Fiscal Q4 2020, an increase of $1,404,407 or 51%. The increase of marketing as a percentage of revenues is a result of a planned advertising spending increase throughout Fiscal Year 2021, targeted primarily to our highest LTV programs. Specifically, the majority of the advertising spending increase in the quarter was specifically directed to the three new pre-licensure metro locations; Austin, Tampa and Nashville.\nAspen University marketing and promotional costs represented 21% of Aspen University revenues for Fiscal Q4 2021, while USU marketing and promotional costs was 18% of USU revenues for Fiscal Q4 2021.\nAGI corporate marketing expenses was $310,415 for Fiscal Q4 2021 compared to $265,375 for Fiscal Q4 2020, or an increase of 17%.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Year 2021\") compared to April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Year 2020\")\n\nInstructional Costs and Services\nInstructional costs and services for Fiscal Year 2021 increased to $15,275,131 or 23% of revenues from $9,639,322 or 20% of revenues for Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of $5,635,809 or 58%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in class starts year-over-year and additional full-time faculty staffing in the USU MSN-FNP program and faculty hiring in the BSN Pre-Licensure campus locations in Phoenix, Austin and Tampa.\nAspen University instructional costs and services represented 22% of Aspen University revenues for Fiscal Year 2021, while USU instructional costs and services was 25% of USU revenues during Fiscal Year 2021.\nMarketing and Promotional\nMarketing and promotional costs for Fiscal Year 2021 were $14,178,602 or 21% of revenues compared to $9,495,980 or 19% of revenues for Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of $4,682,622 or 49%. The increase of marketing as a percentage of revenues from 19% to 21% year-over-year in Fiscal 2021 is a result of a planned advertising spending increase throughout Fiscal Year 2021, targeted primarily to our highest LTV programs, which resulted in a record 9,321 new student enrollments for Fiscal Year 2021. In the second half of Fiscal Year 2021, the majority of the advertising spending increase was directed to the two new pre-licensure metro locations: Austin and Tampa.\nAspen University marketing and promotional costs represented 20% of Aspen University revenues for Fiscal Year 2021, while USU marketing and promotional costs was 18% of USU revenues for Fiscal Year 2021.\nAGI corporate marketing expenses were $1,068,292 for Fiscal Year 2021 compared to $994,113 for Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of $74,179 or 7%.\nCosts and Expenses\nGeneral and Administrative\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020\n\nGeneral and administrative costs for Fiscal Q4 2021 were $11,184,681 or 59% of revenues compared to $7,716,277 or 55% of revenues during Fiscal Q4 2020, an increase of $3,468,404, or 45%. The increase was primarily due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense, which includes stock-based compensation expense, to support the growth of the business, new campus expansion costs of approximately $1.0 million at Aspen University, merchant banking fees, insurance expense and recruiting fees. In connection with the resignation of the former Chief Financial Officer on February 25, 2021, the Company incurred non-recurring accelerated stock-based compensation expense of approximately $0.6 million related to the accelerated vesting of RSUs and options during Fiscal Q4 2021 as well as $0.3 million of severance.\nAspen University general and administrative costs which are included in the above amount represented 36% of Aspen University revenues for Fiscal Q4 2021. The increase was due, in part, to new campus expansion costs of approximately $1.0 million for investment in faculty and campus leadership positions to launch and support the new Tampa and Austin markets.\nUSU general and administrative costs equaled 34% of USU revenues for Fiscal Q4 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense to support the growth of the business.\nAGI's general and administrative costs for Fiscal Q4 2021 and Fiscal Q4 2020 which are included in the above amounts equaled $4.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense to support the growth of the business, and increases in banking fees and insurance expense.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Year 2021\") compared to April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Year 2020\")\n\nGeneral and administrative costs for Fiscal Year 2021 were $41,908,030 or 62% of revenues compared to $30,329,520 or 62% of revenues during Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of $11,578,510, or 38%. The increase was primarily due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense to support the growth of the business and other-employee related costs, accelerated stock-based compensation amortization expense related to the $9 and $10 tranche RSU price vesting of $1.2 million at AGI in Fiscal Q2 2021, new campus expansion costs of approximately $1 million at Aspen University; and increases in merchant banking fees and insurance expense. In connection with the resignation of the former Chief Financial Officer on February 25, 2021, the Company incurred non-recurring accelerated stock-based compensation expense of approximately $0.6 million related to the accelerated vesting of RSUs and options during the Fiscal Q4 2021. Note, of the $11.6 million year-over-year increase, $2.4 million are non-recurring costs.\nThe remaining $12 tranche related to the Executive RSU grant has approximately $1.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense at April 30, 2021, which is being amortized over the remaining period through February 4, 2024 when all RSUs will vest subject to continued employment, that could accelerate during the next two years. If our common stock meets the $12 price target, all remaining amortization will accelerate.\nAspen University general and administrative costs, which are included in the above amount, represented 34% of Aspen University revenues for Fiscal Year 2021. The increase was primarily due to new campus expansion costs of approximately $1.6 million for investment in faculty and campus leadership positions to launch and support the new Tampa and Austin markets.\nUSU general and administrative costs equaled 40% of USU revenues for Fiscal Year 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense to support the growth of the business.\nAGI corporate general and administrative costs for Fiscal Year 2021 and Fiscal Year 2020, which are included in the above amounts, was $17.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense to support the growth of the business, non-cash accelerated stock-based compensation amortization expense related to the $9 and $10 tranche RSU price vesting of $1.2 million, and increases in banking fees and insurance expense.\nBad Debt Expense\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020\n\nBad debt expense for Fiscal Q4 2021 decreased to $566,540 from $780,005 for Fiscal Q4 2020, a decrease of $213,465, or 27%. Based on revenue growth trends and review of accounts receivable, the Company evaluated its reserve methodology and lowered the reserve for Aspen University in Fiscal Q4 2021, but increased the reserve for USU by approximately $200,000.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Year 2021\") compared to April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Year 2020\")\n\nBad debt expense for Fiscal Year 2021 increased to $2,268,540 from $1,431,210 for Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of $837,330, or 59%. Based on revenue growth trends and review of accounts receivable, the Company evaluated its reserve methodology and increased reserves for Aspen and USU accordingly, as well as approximately $700,000 of Aspen University and $100,000 of USU student accounts were written off against the accounts receivable allowance during Fiscal Year 2021.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020\n\nDepreciation and amortization costs for Fiscal Q4 2021 increased to $874,111 from $493,268 for Fiscal Q4 2020, an increase of $380,843, or 77%. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due primarily to investments in developed capitalized software to support the Company's services and computer equipment along with amortization of leasehold improvements.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Year 2021\") compared to April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Year 2020\")\n\nDepreciation and amortization costs for Fiscal Year 2021 increased to $2,426,365 from $2,203,461 for Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of $222,904, or 10%. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to investments in developed capitalized software placed in service earlier in the fiscal year to support the Company's services and computer equipment along with amortization of leasehold improvements, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense of fully amortized intangibles at USU in Fiscal Year 2020.\nOther Expense, net\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020\n\nOther expense, net for Fiscal Q4 2021 primarily includes interest expense related to the commitment fees on the undrawn $5 million Revolving Credit Facility which matures on November 4, 2021; with a 2% commitment fee on the undrawn portion payable quarterly.\nOther expense, net for Fiscal Q4 2020 primarily includes interest expense related to (i) the $10 million Senior Secured Term Loans issued on March 6, 2019, with an annual interest rate of 12% payable monthly, (which were cancelled and exchanged for the $10 million Convertible Notes on January 22, 2020) and the non-cash write-off of the debt discount in connection with a debt extinguishment related to issued $10 million Convertible Debt on January 22, 2020 (the write-off was approximately $200,000 and included in one-time expense items); and (ii) the commitment fees on the $5 million Revolving Credit Facility; partially offset by other income.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Year 2021\") compared to April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Year 2020\")\n\nOther expense, net for Fiscal Year 2021 includes: interest expense of (i) a non-cash charge of $1.4 million of accelerated amortization expense related to the conversion of the $10 million Convertible Notes which occurred on September 14, 2020; (ii) $0.5 million for the $10 million Convertible Notes issued on January 22, 2020 as well as the commitment fee on the $5 million Revolving Credit Facility; (iii) an adjustment of $0.3 million related to the previously reported earned revenue fee calculation deemed immaterial to our Fiscal Year 2019 revenue; (iv) a non-cash modification and accelerated amortization charges of $0.2 million related to the exercise of the 2018 and 2019 Cooperman Warrants on June 5, 2020; partially offset by $0.3 million of other income.\nOther expense, net for Fiscal Year 2020 includes: interest expense of $1.4 million primarily related to (i) the\n$10 million Senior Secured Term Loans issued on March 6, 2019 and the non-cash write-off of debt discount in connection with a debt extinguishment related to issued $10 million Convertible Debt on January 22, 2020 (the write-off was approximately $200,000 and included in one-time expense items); and (ii) the commitment fees on the $5 million Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by $0.3 million of other income.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020\n\nIncome tax benefit for Fiscal Q4 2021 was $12,446 compared to an income tax benefit of $10,688 for Fiscal Q4 2020. Although, Aspen Group experienced operating losses in both periods, the fiscal year 2020 provision relates to an income tax adjustment for the year. As management made a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets stemming from these losses, there was no tax benefit recorded in the statement of operations in either period.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Year 2021\") compared to April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Year 2020\")\n\nIncome tax expense for Fiscal Year 2021 was $32,644 compared to $51,820 in for Fiscal Year 2020. Aspen Group experienced operating losses in both periods. As management made a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets stemming from these losses, there was no tax benefit recorded in the statement of operations in either period.\nNet Loss\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020\n\nNet loss was $(2,319,986), or net loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.09) for Fiscal Q4 2021 as compared to $(664,563), or net loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.03) for Fiscal Q4 2020, or an increase in net loss of $(1,655,423), or (249)%.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 (\"Fiscal Year 2021\") compared to April 30, 2020 (\"Fiscal Year 2020\")\n\nNet loss was $(10,448,973), or net loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.44) for Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to $(5,659,065), or net loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.29) for Fiscal Year 2020, or an increase in net loss of $(4,789,908), or (85)%.\nThis increase in net loss of $(4,789,908) includes $2.6 million of non-cash items previously disclosed ($1.2 million non-cash charge related to the RSU vesting and the $1.4 million charge related to the conversion of $10 million Convertible Notes). Without these items, the net loss increase would have been approximately $2.2 million. This $2.2 million increase in net loss year-over-year is primarily a result of the new campus costs at Aspen University (approximately $1.6 million) and CFO transition costs disclosed above.\nNon-GAAP - Financial Measures\nThis discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss), and cash flow from operating activities, liquidity or any other financial measures. They may not be\nindicative of the historical operating results of AGI nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOur management uses and relies on EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that management, analysts and shareholders benefit from referring to the following non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of items that affect comparability. Our management recognizes that the non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations because of the excluded items described below.\nWe have included a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between AGI and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measure and the corresponding GAAP measure provided by each company under applicable SEC rules.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nAGI defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding: (1) bad debt expense; (2) stock-based compensation; and (3) non-recurring charges. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nThe Company had a net loss of $(10,448,973) for Fiscal Year 2021 compared to a net loss of $(5,659,065) for Fiscal Year 2020, EBITDA loss of $(5,958,419) for Fiscal Year 2021 compared to an EBITDA loss of $(1,585,706) for Fiscal Year 2020 and Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $1,266,951 for Fiscal Year 2021 from Adjusted EBITDA of $2,707,560 for Fiscal Year 2020.\nAspen University generated $7.3 million of net income, EBITDA of $9.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $11.6 million in Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to $6.0 million of net income, EBITDA of $7.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 million in Fiscal Year 2020. Aspen's BSN Pre-Licensure program accounted for $4.1 million of the $9.5 million EBITDA generated at Aspen University for Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to $2.3 million of the $7.4 million EBITDA generated in Fiscal Year 2020.\nUSU generated net income of $2.9 million, EBITDA of $3.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 million for Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to net income of $0.4 million, EBITDA of $1.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million in for Fiscal Year 2020.\nAGI corporate incurred a net loss of $(20.7 million), EBITDA of ($18.6 million) and Adjusted EBITDA of ($14.0 million) for Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to a net loss of $(12.0 million), EBITDA of ($10.1 million) and Adjusted EBITDA of ($7.8 million) for Fiscal Year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal Year 2021 primarily includes non-recurring charges for (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million related to the resignation of CFO in Fiscal Q4 2021 and $1.2 million related to the accelerated amortization expense for the price vesting of Executive RSUs in Fiscal Q2 2021; and (ii) other severance and recruitment expenses primarily related to CFO transition costs in Fiscal Q4 2021, $1.4 million interest expense charge related to the conversion of $10 million Convertible Notes in Fiscal Q2 2021, $0.1 million of interest expense which arose from the\nacceleration of amortization arising from the exercise of warrants issued to a lender in Fiscal Q1 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal Year 2020 includes one-time items for stock-based compensation and other expenses primarily related to the January 2020 equity financing and the prior CFO transition.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by business unit:\n\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nAGI defines Adjusted Gross Profit as GAAP Gross Profit including amortization expense which is excluded from cost of revenue on the statements of operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit inclusive of amortization:\n\nGAAP Gross Profit increased by 28% to $36,923,910 or 54% gross margin for Fiscal Year 2021 from $28,848,788 or 59% gross margin for Fiscal Year 2020. Adjusted Gross profit increased 28% to $38,358,787 or 57% gross margin for Fiscal Year 2021 from $29,925,778 or 61% gross margin for Fiscal Year 2020.\nAspen University GAAP Gross Profit represented 55% of Aspen University revenues for Fiscal Year 2021, and USU GAAP Gross Profit represented 58% of USU revenues for Fiscal Year 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA summary of the Company's cash flows is as follows:\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 consists of net loss adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital. Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation, bad debt expense, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of debt discounts and issue costs, warrants issued for services, modification charge for warrants exercised, common shares issued for services and other adjustments.\nAdjustments to net loss consist primarily of tenant improvement allowances received from landlords of $4,685,826, stock-based compensation of $3,958,085, depreciation and amortization expense of $2,426,365, bad debt expense of $2,268,540, and amortization of debt discounts of $1,550,854. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consists of increases in deferred revenue of $3,112,020 and accrued expenses of $1,140,253, partially offset by increases in gross accounts receivable (both short and long term accounts receivable, before allowance for doubtful accounts) of $8,215,190. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to timing of billings for class starts. Accrued expenses increased due primarily to accrual of executive bonus for Fiscal 2021, accrued payroll due to higher headcount and related increase in compensation and benefits expense to support the growth of the business and an increase in accrued marketing due to timing. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to the growth in revenues from increased enrollments and students paying through the monthly payment plan as well as timing of billings for class starts.\nThe Company expects a favorable trend in working capital over time, but there may be volatility from quarter to quarter. In aggregate the Company expects a general trend toward lower cash used in operations in future quarters; however, some quarters could have higher cash used in operations as a result of more cash used to support changes in working capital. Program start timings and the related federal financial aid drawdowns also impact cash timing.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended April 30, 2020 consist primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of $2,203,461, stock-based compensation of $2,116,309 and bad debt expense of $1,431,210. The increase from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in gross accounts receivable (both short and long term accounts receivable, before allowance for doubtful accounts) of $8,717,424, partially offset by increases in deferred revenue of $1,256,129 and $1,197,343 due to students. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to the growth in revenues from increased enrollments and students paying through the monthly payment plan as well as timing of billings for class starts. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to timing of billings for class starts.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 includes purchases of property and equipment of $8,848,395 primarily due to investments in leasehold improvements, computer equipment and hardware, Company developed software and new campuses; purchases of courseware and accreditation of $120,408 and purchase of a domain name of $8,500.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended April 30, 2020 includes purchases of property and equipment of $3,276,510 primarily due to investments in Company developed software, computer equipment and hardware, instructional equipment and new campuses; and purchases of courseware and accreditation of $13,851.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 includes proceeds from stock options exercised of $2,669,247 and proceeds from warrants exercised of $1,081,792 received from the cash exercise of warrants associated with the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2020 includes proceeds from the sale of common stock, net of underwriter costs of $16,044,879; proceeds from stock options exercised of $962,650; and a common stock short swing reclamation of $21,760, partially offset by $51,282 of disbursements for equity offering costs.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAt July 9, 2021, the Company had cash deposits of approximately $12.1 million, including $4.1 million of restricted cash. Our cash balances are kept liquid to support our growing infrastructure needs. The majority of our cash is concentrated in large financial institutions.\nThe Company also has access to a $5 million Revolving Credit Facility. At April 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility.\nThe Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its campus operations. The Company's Fiscal year 2022 capital expenditures are expected to be lower than Fiscal Year 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $0.5 million related to new campus costs. Additionally, the Company expects additional cash commitments for letters of credits related to securing new campus locations.\nThe Company expects that its existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund its working capital, including capital expenditures, investing and other needs for more than the next 12 months. As disclosed earlier in this Report, the Company intends to be net income positive by Fiscal Q4 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn response to financial reporting release FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, from the SEC, we have selected our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on our financial condition. There were no material changes to our principal accounting estimates during the period covered by this report.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nRevenue consisting primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught by Aspen online as well as from related educational resources that Aspen provides to its students, such as access to our online materials and learning management system. Tuition revenue is recognized pro-rata over the applicable period of instruction. Aspen maintains an institutional tuition refund policy, which provides for all or a portion of tuition to be refunded if a student withdraws during stated refund periods. Certain states in which students reside impose separate, mandatory refund policies, which override Aspen's policy to the extent in conflict. If a student withdraws at a time when a portion or none of the tuition is refundable, then in accordance with its revenue recognition policy, Aspen recognizes as revenue the tuition that was not refunded. Since Aspen recognizes revenue pro-rata over the term of the course and because, under its institutional refund policy, the amount subject to refund is never greater than the amount of the revenue that has been deferred, under Aspen's accounting policies revenue is not recognized with respect to amounts that could potentially be refunded. Aspen's educational programs have starting and ending dates that differ from its fiscal quarters. Therefore, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a portion of revenue from these programs is not yet earned and is therefore deferred. Aspen also charges students annual fees for library, technology and other services, which are recognized over the related service period. Deferred revenue represents the amount of tuition, fees, and other student payments received in excess of the portion recognized as revenue and it is included in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Other revenue may be recognized as sales occur or services are performed.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nAll students are required to select both a primary and secondary payment option with respect to amounts due to Aspen for tuition, fees and other expenses. The most common payment option for Aspen's students is personal funds or payment made on their behalf by an employer. In instances where a student selects financial aid as the primary payment option, he or she often selects personal cash as the secondary option. If a student who has selected financial aid as his or her primary payment option withdraws prior to the end of a course but after the date that Aspen's institutional refund period has expired, the student will have incurred the obligation to pay the full cost of the course. If the withdrawal occurs before the date at which the student has earned 100% of his or her financial aid, Aspen will have to return all or a portion of the Title IV funds to the DOE and the student will owe Aspen all amounts incurred that are in excess of the amount of financial aid that the student earned and that Aspen is entitled to retain. In this case, Aspen must collect the receivable using the student's second payment option.\nFor accounts receivable from students, Aspen records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of its students to make required payments, which includes the recovery of financial aid funds advanced to a student for amounts in excess of the student's cost of tuition and related fees. Aspen determines the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts using a general reserve method based on an analysis of its historical bad debt experience, current economic trends, and the aging of the accounts receivable and student status. AGI establishes reserves to its receivables based upon an estimate of the risk presented by the program within the university, student status, payment type and age of receivables. Aspen writes off accounts receivable balances at the time the balances are deemed uncollectible. Aspen continues to reflect accounts receivable with an offsetting allowance as long as management believes there is a reasonable possibility of collection.\nFor accounts receivable from primary payors other than students, Aspen estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations, such as bankruptcy proceedings and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond contractual terms. In these cases, Aspen uses assumptions and judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances, to record a specific allowance for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These specific allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. The amounts calculated are analyzed to determine the total amount of the allowance. Aspen may also record a general allowance as necessary.\nDirect write-offs are taken in the period when Aspen has exhausted its efforts to collect overdue and unpaid receivables or otherwise evaluate other circumstances that indicate that Aspen should abandon such efforts.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the 2017 acquisition of USU. Goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested annually as of April 30 for impairment.\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04: \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)\u201d - to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2\nfrom the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company early adopted this standard effective April 30, 2018. We have selected an April 30 annual goodwill impairment test date.\nWhen evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, management first assesses a range of qualitative factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and the overall financial performance for each of the Company's reporting units. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then proceed to the quantitative impairment testing.\nWe compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.\nWhen required, we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology which includes estimates of future cash flows to be generated by a component where the goodwill is recorded, as well as determining a discount rate to measure the present value of those anticipated cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and includes making assumptions about projected growth rates, industry-specific factors, working capital requirements, weighted average cost of capital, and current and anticipated operating conditions. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different results.\nIntangible assets represent both indefinite lived and definite lived assets. Acquired accreditation and regulatory approvals and Trade name and trademarks are deemed to have indefinite useful lives and accordingly are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment. Student relationships and curriculums are deemed to have definite lives and are amortized accordingly.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is expensed over the requisite service period, which is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. For employee stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeiture rates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. For non-employee stock-based awards, the Company follows ASU 2018-7, which substantially aligns share based compensation for employees and non-employees.\nRSUs are awards in the form of shares denominated in the equivalent number of shares of ASPU common stock and with the value of each RSU being equal to the fair value of ASPU common stock at the date of grant. RSU awards may be subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests and/or other vesting restrictions based on the nature and recipient of the award. For RSU awards, the expense is typically measured at the grant date as the fair value of ASPU common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term, which is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company did not have any related party transactions in fiscal year 2021.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of April 30, 2021.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our continuing focus on the nursing profession, the expected changes in our business plan in fiscal year 2022, including the anticipated changes in the advertising spend, enrollments and bookings in fiscal year 2022, our goal of achieving positive GAAP net income by Q4 of the fiscal year 2022, the timing of launching phase two of our in-house CRM and the expected impact of its implementation on our operations, persistence rates and LTV, our beliefs with respect to our student acquisition costs and faculty cost model, the future potential of our BSN Pre-Licensure Program, the future job opportunities for licensed practical nurses and registered nurses, future competitive trends in our industry, including increased competition as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our leads acquisition strategy and the expected sources of leads, our future ability to provide lower costs per enrollment, our estimates concerning LTV and ARPU, the expected revenue run rate per annum following the implementation of double cohort enrollments at the Phoenix main campus, our estimates with respect to the adequacy of our bad debt reserves, our expectations regarding future trends in the six-year MPP accounts receivable, the expected continued revenue growth in the BSN Pre-Licensure and USU businesses as a percentage of total revenues and the expected impact thereof on our accounts receivable, allowance for doubtful accounts and cash flow from operations, the expected rate and timing of subsequent campus openings, the impact of bookings, future expansion of our operating margins, the anticipated impact of our enhanced recovery and collections process, our beliefs with respect to the short-term impact of COVID-19 on class starts and enrollments, the expected sources of future revenue growth, our anticipated working capital trends, the expected capital expenditures related to new campus openings and letters of credit, and our future liquidity.
