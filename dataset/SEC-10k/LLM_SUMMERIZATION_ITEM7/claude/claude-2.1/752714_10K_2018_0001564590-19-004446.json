The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company's primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment ( Mobile Modular\u201d); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment ( TRS-RenTelco\u201d); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment ( Adler Tanks\u201d); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California ( Enviroplex\u201d). In 2018, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 53%, 28%, 14% and 5%, respectively, of the Company's income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of pre-tax income\u201d), compared to 50%, 31%, 13% and 6%, respectively, for 2017. Although managed as a separate business segment, Enviroplex's revenues, pre-tax income contribution and total assets are not significant relative to the Company's consolidated financial position.\nThe Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment's capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment's potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value.\nThe Company's rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 81% of the Company's total revenues in 2018 and for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 53%, 24% and 24%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company's direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs).\nThe Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company's Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer's license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 19% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2018 and for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 71%, 27% and 2% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company's cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work.\nThe rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 24%, 26% and 23% of the Company's consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (For more information, see Item 1. Business - Relocatable Modular Buildings - Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)\u201d above.)\nSelling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company's operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company's operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company's ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2019, the Company announced that its board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.375 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2019, an increase of 10% over the prior year's comparable quarter.\nPercentage of Revenue Table\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated the results of operations as a percentage of the Company's total revenues and the percentage of changes

Consolidated net income in 2018 decreased to $79.4 million, or $3.24 per diluted share in 2018, compared to $153.9 million, or $6.34 per diluted share, in 2017. 2017 results included an increase to net income of $102.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, due to the tax benefit associated with the enactment by the U.S. government of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d), which is discussed below.

In addition, a one-time transition income tax estimated at $0.3 million related to repatriation of foreign earnings was recorded. The provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of 84.4% in 2017 compared to a tax provision of 24.2% in 2018. The tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the $102.5 million net impact of the Tax Act. In addition, in 2018 the Company benefited from the recording of $2.0 million excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation as a reduction to the provision for income taxes compared to $0.9 million in 2017.

Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco's rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, TRS-RenTelco's selling and administrative expenses increased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $22.2 million from $21.9 million in 2016, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs, partly offset by lower allocated corporate expenses.\nAdler Tanks\nFor 2017, Adler Tanks' total revenues increased $7.5 million, or 9%, to $91.4 million compared to 2016, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues during 2017. The revenue increase together with higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in a pre-tax income increase of $4.0 million, or 61%, to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from

Cash flows for the Company in 2018 as compared to 2017 are summarized as follows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company's operations provided net cash flow of $142.7 million for 2018 as compared to $122.4 million in 2017. The 17% increase was primarily attributable to improved operating profit, higher decrease in accounts receivable, lower increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, an increase in deferred income and other balance sheet changes.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $104.5 million for 2018 as compared to $70.9 million in 2017. The $33.6 million increase was primarily due to $28.5 million higher purchases of rental equipment of $123.1 million in 2018, compared to $94.6 million in 2017, $7.5 million cash payment for the acquisition of business assets, $1.0 million higher purchases of property, plant and equipment, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $39.1 million in 2018 as compared to $49.9 million in 2017. The $10.8 million decrease was primarily due to $18.0 million higher net borrowings under the Company's bank lines of credit, partly offset by $6.0 million higher payment of dividends.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company's rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings and notes offerings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company's rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company's common stock.\nAs the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years.\nFunding of Rental Asset Growth\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 405,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sales of used rental equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash available for purchase of rental equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 170,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 515,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of rental equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (123,071\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (94,579\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79,038\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (296,688\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash paid for acquisition of business assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,543\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,543\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash available for other uses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $15.7 million in 2018, $14.6 million in 2017 and $10.5 million in 2016, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $30.9 million, $24.9 million and $24.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Company has in the past made repurchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in the over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) and/or through privately negotiated, block transactions under an authorization from the Board of Directors. Shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued stock. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of February 25, 2019, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase.\nUnsecured Revolving Lines of Credit\nIn March 2016, the Company renewed its credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the Credit Facility\u201d). The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2021 and replaced the Company's prior $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $620.0 million with $200.0\nmillion of additional commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.\nIn March 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., extending its line of credit facility related to its cash management services ( Sweep Service Facility\u201d) and increasing the facility size from $10.0 million to $12.0 million. The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2021, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services.\nAt December 31, 2018, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $198.6 million was outstanding, and had capacity to borrow up to an additional $233.4 million. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility):\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.

( PIM\u201d), The Prudential Insurance Company of America and Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million of its 4.03% Series A Senior Notes (the Series A Senior Notes\u201d) to the Purchaser. The Series A Senior Notes were an unsecured obligation of the Company, due on April 21, 2018. Interest on these notes was due semi-annually in arrears and the principal was due in five equal annual installments, with the first payment due on April 21, 2014. In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement allowed for the issuance and sale of additional senior notes to the Purchaser (the Shelf Notes\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, to mature no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life of no more than 10 years and to bear interest on the unpaid balance. The final $20.0 million principal payment under the Series A Senior Notes was made in April 2018 with no amount remaining outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\n3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021\nOn March 17, 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the Series B Senior Notes\u201d) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2021. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million.\n3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022\nOn November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the Series C Senior Notes\u201d) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net\nproceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company's revolving credit line. At December 31, 2018, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million.\nAmong other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series A Senior Notes, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement):\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.

There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants.\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement ( 2016 Amendment\u201d) with the Purchaser. Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, (i) the issuance period for the shelf notes to be issued and sold pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement is extended until the earlier of February 9, 2019 or the termination of the issuance and sale of the shelf notes upon the 30 days' prior notice of either PIM or the Company, and (ii) the definition of the Available Facility Amount,\u201d which is the aggregate amount of the shelf notes that may be authorized for purchase pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement was amended to equal a formula based on: $250 million, minus the aggregate principal amount of the shelf notes then outstanding and purchased pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, minus the shelf notes accepted by the Company for purchase, but not yet purchased, by the Purchaser pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement; provided, however, the aggregate amount of the shelf notes purchased by any corporation or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, PIM shall not exceed $200 million.\nAlthough no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company's material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2021, outstanding amounts under our 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance.

The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The Company has identified that its most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, depreciation, maintenance, repair and refurbishment, impairment of rental equipment and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Descriptions of these accounting policies are found in both the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nRevenue recognition:\nLease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.\nNon-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company's promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company's best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation.\nDepreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company's experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness.\nThe lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers' selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies.\nChanges in useful lives or residual values will impact depreciation expense and any gain or loss from the sale of used equipment. Depending on the magnitude of such changes, the impact on the financial statements could be significant.\nMaintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company's policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. Changes in these policies could impact the Company's financial results.\nImpairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company's rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Additionally, if the Company decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the rental equipment, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell or dispose. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company assesses the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill and intangible assets annually or in interim periods if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The impairment review is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step process requires management to make certain judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step in the evaluation consists of estimating the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted cash flows using revenue and after tax profit estimates. Management then compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit's carrying amount, which includes goodwill and intangible assets. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and intangible assets and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets.\nImpact of Inflation\nAlthough the Company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation, from time to time it has experienced increases in costs of rental equipment, manufacturing costs, operating expenses and interest. Because a majority of its rentals are relatively short-term, the Company has generally been able to pass on such increased costs through increases in rental rates and selling prices, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to pass on increased costs to customers in the future.\nOff Balance Sheet Transactions\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements,\u201d as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company's primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment ( Mobile Modular\u201d); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment ( TRS-RenTelco\u201d); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment ( Adler Tanks\u201d); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California ( Enviroplex\u201d). In 2018, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 53%, 28%, 14% and 5%, respectively, of the Company's income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of pre-tax income\u201d), compared to 50%, 31%, 13% and 6%, respectively, for 2017. Although managed as a separate business segment, Enviroplex's revenues, pre-tax income contribution and total assets are not significant relative to the Company's consolidated financial position.\nThe Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment's capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment's potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value.\nThe Company's rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 81% of the Company's total revenues in 2018 and for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 53%, 24% and 24%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company's direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs).\nThe Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company's Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer's license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 19% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2018 and for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 71%, 27% and 2% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company's cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work.\nThe rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 24%, 26% and 23% of the Company's consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (For more information, see Item 1. Business - Relocatable Modular Buildings - Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)\u201d above.)\nSelling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company's operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company's operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company's ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2019, the Company announced that its board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.375 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2019, an increase of 10% over the prior year's comparable quarter.\nPercentage of Revenue Table\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated the results of operations as a percentage of the Company's total revenues and the percentage of changes

31, 2018 Compared to\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nOverview\nConsolidated revenues in 2018 increased 8%, to $498.3 million from $462.0 million in 2017. Consolidated net income in 2018 decreased to $79.4 million, or $3.24 per diluted share in 2018, compared to $153.9 million, or $6.34 per diluted share, in 2017. 2017 results included an increase to net income of $102.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, due to the tax benefit associated with the enactment by the U.S. government of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d), which is discussed below. The Company's year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental and rental related services revenues as more fully described below.\nFor 2018 compared to 2017, on a consolidated basis:\n \u2022 Gross profit increased $26.9 million, or 13%, to $233.3 million. Mobile Modular's gross profit increased $16.8 million, or 16%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. Adler Tanks' gross profit increased $4.8 million, or 11%, due to higher gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by lower gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues. TRS-RenTelco's gross profit increased $4.5 million, or 9%, due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues. Enviroplex's gross profit increased $0.8 million, or 9%, primarily due to higher gross margin on sales revenues. \n \u2022 Selling and administrative expenses increased $4.2 million, or 4%, to $115.8 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs across all divisions. \n \u2022 Interest expense increased $0.7 million, or 6%, to $12.3 million, primarily due to 11% higher net average interest rate, partly offset by 5% lower average debt levels of the Company. \n \u2022 Pre-tax income contribution was 53%, 28% and 14% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2018, compared to 50%, 31% and 13%, respectively, in 2017. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 5% and 6% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n \u2022 The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and required a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company re-measured its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net benefit of $102.8 million. In addition, a one-time transition income tax estimated at $0.3 million related to repatriation of foreign earnings was recorded. The provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of 84.4% in 2017 compared to a tax provision of 24.2% in 2018. The tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the $102.5 million net impact of the Tax Act. In addition, in 2018 the Company benefited from the recording of $2.0 million excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation as a reduction to the provision for income taxes compared to $0.9 million in 2017. These tax benefits, or shortfalls, were recorded in equity prior to 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA increased $24.8 million, or 14%, to $203.1 million compared to $178.3 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d on page 33. \nMobile Modular\nFor 2018, Mobile Modular's total revenues increased $23.3 million, or 10%, to $254.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental, rental related services and sales revenues. The revenue increase, together with higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $13.9 million, or 33%, to $55.6 million in 2018.\nThe following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected

Period end rental equipment represents the cost of rental equipment excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. \n Average monthly total yield is calculated by dividing the averages of monthly rental revenues by the cost of rental equipment for the period. \n Period end utilization is calculated by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. Average utilization for the period is calculated using the average month end costs of the rental equipment. \n Average monthly rental rate is calculated by dividing the averages of monthly rental revenues by the cost of rental equipment on rent for the period. \nMobile Modular's gross profit for 2018 increased 16% to $120.8 million from $103.9 million in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $16.6 million, or 12%, compared to 2017, due to 3% higher average rental equipment on rent and 8% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 13% in 2018 compared to 15% in 2017 and other direct costs were 27% in 2018 and 29% in 2017, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60% in 2018 compared to 56% in 2017. Other direct costs in 2017 included a $1.6 million impairment of rental assets, deemed beyond economic repair in the Southern California region. The higher rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing 19%, to $95.1 million from $80.0 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues increased $4.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2017. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher repair revenue and increased services performed during the lease. The higher revenues, partly offset by lower gross margin percentage of 24% in 2018 compared to 25% in 2017 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing 2%, to $13.0 million from $12.7 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $2.0 million, or 5%, compared to 2017. Gross profit on sales increased $1.0 million, or 9%, due to higher used equipment sales revenues and higher gross margins of 29% in 2018 compared to 28% in 2017. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular's rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. \nFor 2018, Mobile Modular's selling and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million, or 4%, to $58.0 million, primarily due to increased employee salaries and benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses.\nTRS-RenTelco\nFor 2018, TRS-RenTelco's total revenues increased $10.6 million, or 10%, to $118.7 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues. Pre-tax income increased $2.6 million, or 10%, to $28.8 million for 2018, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues, partly offset by foreign currency exchange loss in 2018 and higher selling and administrative expenses.\nThe following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected

For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $7.1 million, or 9%, to $89.9 million with depreciation expense increasing $3.1 million, or 9%, and other direct costs increasing $1.2 million, or 9%, resulting in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of $2.8 million, or 8%, to $39.2 million in 2018. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 40% in 2018 and 2017 and other direct costs was 16% in 2018 and 2017, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 44% in 2018 and 2017. The rental revenues increase was due to 9% higher average rental equipment on rent. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $2.7 million, or 13%, compared to 2017. The lower gross margin percentage of 55% in 2018, compared to 57% in 2017 was primarily due to lower gross margin on new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower gross margin, resulted in gross profit on sales increasing 9%, to $12.6 million from $11.6 million in 2017. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco's rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. \nFor 2018, TRS-RenTelco's selling and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 3%, to $22.8 million, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses.\nAdler Tanks\nFor 2018, Adler Tanks' total revenues increased $4.7 million, or 5%, to $96.1 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental revenues, partly offset by lower sales revenues during 2018. The revenue increase together with higher gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by lower gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues, and higher selling and administrative expenses resulted in a pre-tax income increase of $4.2 million, or 39%, to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and

Lower gross margin percentage of 20% in 2018 compared to 21% in 2017, partly offset by higher revenue, resulted in rental related services gross profit decreasing $0.1 million, or 1%, to $5.0 million from $5.1 million in 2017. \nFor 2018, Adler Tanks' selling and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million, or 2% to $30.0 million from $29.5 million in the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nOverview\nConsolidated revenues in 2017 increased 9%, to $462.0 million from $424.1 million in 2016. Consolidated net income in 2017 increased to $153.9 million, or $6.34 per diluted share in 2017, compared to $38.3 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, in 2016. 2017 results include an increase to net income of $102.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, due to the tax benefit associated with the enactment by the U.S. government of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d), which is discussed below. The Company's year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental, sales and rental related services revenues as more fully described below.\nFor 2017 compared to 2016, on a consolidated basis:\n \u2022 Gross profit increased $22.2 million, or 12%, to $206.3 million. Mobile Modular's gross profit increased $10.1 million, or 11%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. Adler Tanks' gross profit increased $5.8 million, or 16%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. TRS-RenTelco's gross profit increased $4.5 million, or 10%, due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues. Enviroplex's gross profit increased $1.8 million, or 25%, primarily due to higher sales revenues. \n \u2022 Selling and administrative expenses increased $6.7 million, or 6%, to $111.6 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs and professional fees. \n \u2022 Interest expense decreased $0.6 million, or 5%, to $11.6 million, primarily due to 10% lower average debt levels of the Company, partly offset by 5% higher net average interest rate. \n \u2022 Pre-tax income contribution was 50%, 31% and 13% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2017, compared to 53%, 32% and 10%, respectively, in 2016. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 6% and 5% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n \u2022 The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and required a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company re-measured its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net benefit of $102.8 million. In addition, a one-time transition income tax estimated at $0.3 million related to repatriation of foreign earnings was recorded. The provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of 84.4% compared to a tax provision of 42.9% in 2016. The tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the $102.5 million net impact of the Tax Act. In addition, the Company benefited from $0.9 million lower re-pricing of state deferred tax liabilities in 2017 compared to 2016 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which resulted in the recording of $0.9 million excess tax benefits as a reduction to the provision for income taxes. These tax benefits, or shortfalls, were historically recorded in equity. In addition, in 2016, the decision to exit the Company's Bangalore, India branch increased the 2016 provision for income taxes by $0.7 million as a valuation allowance was recorded against the related deferred tax assets. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA increased $14.9 million, or 9%, to $178.3 million compared to $163.4 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d on page 33. \nMobile Modular\nFor 2017, Mobile Modular's total revenues increased $21.8 million, or 10%, to $231.3 million compared to 2016, primarily due to higher rental, sales and rental related services revenues. The revenue increase, together with higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $6.1 million, or 17%, to $41.7 million in 2017.\nThe following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected

For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $12.1 million, or 9%, compared to 2016, due to 4% higher average rental equipment on rent and 6% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 15% in 2017 compared to 16% in 2016 and other direct costs were 29% in 2017 and 27% in 2016, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 56% in 2017 compared to 57% in 2016. The increased other direct costs in 2017 were partly attributable to a $1.6 million impairment of rental assets, deemed beyond economic repair in the Southern California region. The higher rental revenues, partly offset by lower rental margins, resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing 8%, to $80.0 million from $73.8 million in 2016. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues increased $1.2 million, or 3%, compared to 2016. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher services performed during the lease, and higher delivery and return delivery at Mobile Modular Portable Storage. The higher revenues and higher gross margin percentage of 25% in 2017 compared to 24% in 2016 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing 7%, to $12.7 million from $11.8 million in 2016. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $8.0 million, or 27%, compared to 2016. Gross profit on sales increased $2.6 million, or 34%, due to higher used equipment sales revenues and higher gross margins of 28% in 2017 compared to 26% in 2016. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular's rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. \nFor 2017, Mobile Modular's selling and administrative expenses increased $4.2 million, or 8%, to $55.6 million from $51.4 million in 2016, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs, higher marketing and administrative costs and higher corporate allocated expenses.\nTRS-RenTelco\nFor 2017, TRS-RenTelco's total revenues decreased $0.6 million, or 1%, to $108.0 million compared to 2016, primarily due to lower sales revenues, partly offset by higher rental revenues. Pre-tax income increased $4.8 million, or 23%, to $26.1 million for 2017, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues and foreign currency exchange gain, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.\nThe following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected

For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $0.5 million, or 1%, to $82.8 million with depreciation expense decreasing $2.4 million, or 7%, and other direct costs decreasing $0.8 million, or 6%, resulting in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of $3.7 million, or 11%, to $36.4 million in 2017. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 40% in 2017 compared to 43% in 2016 and other direct costs was 16% in 2017 compared to 17% in 2016, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 44% in 2017 compared to 40% in 2016. The rental revenues increase was due to 3% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 2% lower average monthly rental rates. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues decreased $1.2 million, or 6%, compared to 2016. The higher gross margin percentage of 57% in 2017, compared to 51% in 2016 was primarily due to higher gross margin on used equipment sales. The higher gross margin was partly offset by lower sales revenues, which resulted in gross profit on sales increasing 5%, to $11.6 million from $11.0 million in 2016. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco's rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. \nFor 2017, TRS-RenTelco's selling and administrative expenses increased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $22.2 million from $21.9 million in 2016, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs, partly offset by lower allocated corporate expenses.\nAdler Tanks\nFor 2017, Adler Tanks' total revenues increased $7.5 million, or 9%, to $91.4 million compared to 2016, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues during 2017. The revenue increase together with higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in a pre-tax income increase of $4.0 million, or 61%, to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from

For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $5.4 million, or 9%, due to 12% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 2% lower average rental rates in 2017 as compared to 2016. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 25% and 27% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and other direct costs were 17% in 2017 and 2016, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 59% in 2017 compared to 56% in 2016. The higher rental revenues, together with higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $5.1 million, or 16%, to $37.6 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues increased $1.0 million, or 4%, compared to 2016. The higher revenues and higher gross margin percentage of 21% in 2017 compared to 20% in 2016, resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $0.3 million, or 6%, to $5.1 million from $4.8 million in 2016. \nFor 2017, Adler Tanks' selling and administrative expenses increased $1.9 million, to $29.5 million from $27.6 million in the same period in 2016, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs and higher corporate allocated expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows. Cash flows for the Company in 2018 as compared to 2017 are summarized as follows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company's operations provided net cash flow of $142.7 million for 2018 as compared to $122.4 million in 2017. The 17% increase was primarily attributable to improved operating profit, higher decrease in accounts receivable, lower increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, an increase in deferred income and other balance sheet changes.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $104.5 million for 2018 as compared to $70.9 million in 2017. The $33.6 million increase was primarily due to $28.5 million higher purchases of rental equipment of $123.1 million in 2018, compared to $94.6 million in 2017, $7.5 million cash payment for the acquisition of business assets, $1.0 million higher purchases of property, plant and equipment, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $39.1 million in 2018 as compared to $49.9 million in 2017. The $10.8 million decrease was primarily due to $18.0 million higher net borrowings under the Company's bank lines of credit, partly offset by $6.0 million higher payment of dividends.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company's rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings and notes offerings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company's rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company's common stock.\nAs the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years.\nFunding of Rental Asset Growth\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 405,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sales of used rental equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash available for purchase of rental equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 170,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 515,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of rental equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (123,071\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (94,579\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79,038\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (296,688\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash paid for acquisition of business assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,543\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,543\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash available for other uses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $15.7 million in 2018, $14.6 million in 2017 and $10.5 million in 2016, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $30.9 million, $24.9 million and $24.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Company has in the past made repurchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in the over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) and/or through privately negotiated, block transactions under an authorization from the Board of Directors. Shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued stock. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of February 25, 2019, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase.\nUnsecured Revolving Lines of Credit\nIn March 2016, the Company renewed its credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the Credit Facility\u201d). The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2021 and replaced the Company's prior $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $620.0 million with $200.0\nmillion of additional commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.\nIn March 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., extending its line of credit facility related to its cash management services ( Sweep Service Facility\u201d) and increasing the facility size from $10.0 million to $12.0 million. The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2021, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services.\nAt December 31, 2018, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $198.6 million was outstanding, and had capacity to borrow up to an additional $233.4 million. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility):\n \u2022 Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. \n \u2022 Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. \n \u2022 Permit Tangible Net Worth as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company to be less than the sum of (i) $246.1 million plus (ii) 25% of the Company's Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) (but only if a positive number) for each fiscal quarter ended subsequent to December 31, 2011 plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company's capital stock after December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2018, such sum was $366.8 million and the actual Tangible Net Worth of the Company was $536.5 million. \nAt December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants.\n4.03% Senior Notes Due in 2018\nOn April 21, 2011, the Company entered into a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. ( PIM\u201d), The Prudential Insurance Company of America and Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million of its 4.03% Series A Senior Notes (the Series A Senior Notes\u201d) to the Purchaser. The Series A Senior Notes were an unsecured obligation of the Company, due on April 21, 2018. Interest on these notes was due semi-annually in arrears and the principal was due in five equal annual installments, with the first payment due on April 21, 2014. In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement allowed for the issuance and sale of additional senior notes to the Purchaser (the Shelf Notes\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, to mature no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life of no more than 10 years and to bear interest on the unpaid balance. The final $20.0 million principal payment under the Series A Senior Notes was made in April 2018 with no amount remaining outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\n3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021\nOn March 17, 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the Series B Senior Notes\u201d) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2021. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million.\n3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022\nOn November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the Series C Senior Notes\u201d) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net\nproceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company's revolving credit line. At December 31, 2018, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million.\nAmong other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series A Senior Notes, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement):\n \u2022 Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. \n \u2022 Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. \n \u2022 Permit tangible net worth, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than the sum of (i) $229.0 million, plus (ii) 25% of net income for such fiscal quarter subsequent to December 31, 2010, plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company's capital stock after December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2018, such sum was $366.8 million and the actual tangible net worth of the Company was $536.5 million. \nAt December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants.\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement ( 2016 Amendment\u201d) with the Purchaser. Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, (i) the issuance period for the shelf notes to be issued and sold pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement is extended until the earlier of February 9, 2019 or the termination of the issuance and sale of the shelf notes upon the 30 days' prior notice of either PIM or the Company, and (ii) the definition of the Available Facility Amount,\u201d which is the aggregate amount of the shelf notes that may be authorized for purchase pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement was amended to equal a formula based on: $250 million, minus the aggregate principal amount of the shelf notes then outstanding and purchased pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, minus the shelf notes accepted by the Company for purchase, but not yet purchased, by the Purchaser pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement; provided, however, the aggregate amount of the shelf notes purchased by any corporation or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, PIM shall not exceed $200 million.\nAlthough no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company's material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2021, outstanding amounts under our 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance.

The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The Company has identified that its most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, depreciation, maintenance, repair and refurbishment, impairment of rental equipment and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Descriptions of these accounting policies are found in both the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nRevenue recognition:\nLease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.\nNon-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company's promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company's best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation.\nDepreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company's experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness.\nThe lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers' selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies.\nChanges in useful lives or residual values will impact depreciation expense and any gain or loss from the sale of used equipment. Depending on the magnitude of such changes, the impact on the financial statements could be significant.\nMaintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company's policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. Changes in these policies could impact the Company's financial results.\nImpairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company's rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Additionally, if the Company decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the rental equipment, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell or dispose. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company assesses the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill and intangible assets annually or in interim periods if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The impairment review is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step process requires management to make certain judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step in the evaluation consists of estimating the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted cash flows using revenue and after tax profit estimates. Management then compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit's carrying amount, which includes goodwill and intangible assets. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and intangible assets and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets.\nImpact of Inflation\nAlthough the Company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation, from time to time it has experienced increases in costs of rental equipment, manufacturing costs, operating expenses and interest. Because a majority of its rentals are relatively short-term, the Company has generally been able to pass on such increased costs through increases in rental rates and selling prices, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to pass on increased costs to customers in the future.\nOff Balance Sheet Transactions\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements,\u201d as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company's primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment ( Mobile Modular\u201d); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment ( TRS-RenTelco\u201d); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment ( Adler Tanks\u201d); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California ( Enviroplex\u201d). In 2018, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 53%, 28%, 14% and 5%, respectively, of the Company's income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of pre-tax income\u201d), compared to 50%, 31%, 13% and 6%, respectively, for 2017. Although managed as a separate business segment, Enviroplex's revenues, pre-tax income contribution and total assets are not significant relative to the Company's consolidated financial position.\nThe Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment's capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment's potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value.\nThe Company's rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 81% of the Company's total revenues in 2018 and for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 53%, 24% and 24%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company's direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs).\nThe Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company's Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer's license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 19% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2018 and for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 71%, 27% and 2% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company's cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work.\nThe rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 24%, 26% and 23% of the Company's consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (For more information, see Item 1. Business - Relocatable Modular Buildings - Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)\u201d above.)\nSelling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company's operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company's operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company's ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2019, the Company announced that its board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.375 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2019, an increase of 10% over the prior year's comparable quarter.\nPercentage of Revenue Table\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated the results of operations as a percentage of the Company's total revenues and the percentage of changes in the amount of such of items as compared to the amount in the indicated prior period:\n\nnm = not meaningful\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nOverview\nConsolidated revenues in 2018 increased 8%, to $498.3 million from $462.0 million in 2017. Consolidated net income in 2018 decreased to $79.4 million, or $3.24 per diluted share in 2018, compared to $153.9 million, or $6.34 per diluted share, in 2017. 2017 results included an increase to net income of $102.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, due to the tax benefit associated with the enactment by the U.S. government of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d), which is discussed below. The Company's year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental and rental related services revenues as more fully described below.\nFor 2018 compared to 2017, on a consolidated basis:\n \u2022 Gross profit increased $26.9 million, or 13%, to $233.3 million. Mobile Modular's gross profit increased $16.8 million, or 16%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. Adler Tanks' gross profit increased $4.8 million, or 11%, due to higher gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by lower gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues. TRS-RenTelco's gross profit increased $4.5 million, or 9%, due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues. Enviroplex's gross profit increased $0.8 million, or 9%, primarily due to higher gross margin on sales revenues. \n \u2022 Selling and administrative expenses increased $4.2 million, or 4%, to $115.8 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs across all divisions. \n \u2022 Interest expense increased $0.7 million, or 6%, to $12.3 million, primarily due to 11% higher net average interest rate, partly offset by 5% lower average debt levels of the Company. \n \u2022 Pre-tax income contribution was 53%, 28% and 14% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2018, compared to 50%, 31% and 13%, respectively, in 2017. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 5% and 6% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n \u2022 The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and required a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company re-measured its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net benefit of $102.8 million. In addition, a one-time transition income tax estimated at $0.3 million related to repatriation of foreign earnings was recorded. The provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of 84.4% in 2017 compared to a tax provision of 24.2% in 2018. The tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the $102.5 million net impact of the Tax Act. In addition, in 2018 the Company benefited from the recording of $2.0 million excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation as a reduction to the provision for income taxes compared to $0.9 million in 2017. These tax benefits, or shortfalls, were recorded in equity prior to 2017. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA increased $24.8 million, or 14%, to $203.1 million compared to $178.3 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in Item 6.

For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $16.6 million, or 12%, compared to 2017, due to 3% higher average rental equipment on rent and 8% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 13% in 2018 compared to 15% in 2017 and other direct costs were 27% in 2018 and 29% in 2017, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60% in 2018 compared to 56% in 2017. Other direct costs in 2017 included a $1.6 million impairment of rental assets, deemed beyond economic repair in the Southern California region. The higher rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing 19%, to $95.1 million from $80.0 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues increased $4.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2017. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher repair revenue and increased services performed during the lease. The higher revenues, partly offset by lower gross margin percentage of 24% in 2018 compared to 25% in 2017 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing 2%, to $13.0 million from $12.7 million in 2017. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $2.0 million, or 5%, compared to 2017.

As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 40% in 2018 and 2017 and other direct costs was 16% in 2018 and 2017, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 44% in 2018 and 2017. The rental revenues increase was due to 9% higher average rental equipment on rent. \n \u2022 Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $2.7 million, or 13%, compared to 2017. The lower gross margin percentage of 55% in 2018, compared to 57% in 2017 was primarily due to lower gross margin on new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower gross margin, resulted in gross profit on sales increasing 9%, to $12.6 million from $11.6 million in 2017. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco's rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. \nFor 2018, TRS-RenTelco's selling and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 3%, to $22.8 million, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses.\nAdler Tanks\nFor 2018, Adler Tanks' total revenues increased $4.7 million, or 5%, to $96.1 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental revenues, partly offset by lower sales revenues during 2018.

Lower gross margin percentage of 20% in 2018 compared to 21% in 2017, partly offset by higher revenue, resulted in rental related services gross profit decreasing $0.1 million, or 1%, to $5.0 million from $5.1 million in 2017. \nFor 2018, Adler Tanks' selling and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million, or 2% to $30.0 million from $29.5 million in the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nOverview\nConsolidated revenues in 2017 increased 9%, to $462.0 million from $424.1 million in 2016. Consolidated net income in 2017 increased to $153.9 million, or $6.34 per diluted share in 2017, compared to $38.3 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, in 2016. 2017 results include an increase to net income of $102.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, due to the tax benefit associated with the enactment by the U.S. government of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d), which is discussed below. The Company's year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental, sales and rental related services revenues as more fully described below.\nFor 2017 compared to 2016, on a consolidated basis:\n \u2022 Gross profit increased $22.2 million, or 12%, to $206.3 million.

Cash flows for the Company in 2018 as compared to 2017 are summarized as follows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company's operations provided net cash flow of $142.7 million for 2018 as compared to $122.4 million in 2017. The 17% increase was primarily attributable to improved operating profit, higher decrease in accounts receivable, lower increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, an increase in deferred income and other balance sheet changes.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $104.5 million for 2018 as compared to $70.9 million in 2017. The $33.6 million increase was primarily due to $28.5 million higher purchases of rental equipment of $123.1 million in 2018, compared to $94.6 million in 2017, $7.5 million cash payment for the acquisition of business assets, $1.0 million higher purchases of property, plant and equipment, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $39.1 million in 2018 as compared to $49.9 million in 2017. The $10.8 million decrease was primarily due to $18.0 million higher net borrowings under the Company's bank lines of credit, partly offset by $6.0 million higher payment of dividends.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company's rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings and notes offerings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company's rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company's common stock.\nAs the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years.\nFunding of Rental Asset Growth\n\nIn addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $15.7 million in 2018, $14.6 million in 2017 and $10.5 million in 2016, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $30.9 million, $24.9 million and $24.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Company has in the past made repurchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in the over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) and/or through privately negotiated, block transactions under an authorization from the Board of Directors. Shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued stock. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of February 25, 2019, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase.\nUnsecured Revolving Lines of Credit\nIn March 2016, the Company renewed its credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the Credit Facility\u201d). The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2021 and replaced the Company's prior $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $620.0 million with $200.0\nmillion of additional commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.\nIn March 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., extending its line of credit facility related to its cash management services ( Sweep Service Facility\u201d) and increasing the facility size from $10.0 million to $12.0 million. The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2021, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services.\nAt December 31, 2018, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $198.6 million was outstanding, and had capacity to borrow up to an additional $233.4 million. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility):\n \u2022 Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. \n \u2022 Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. \n \u2022 Permit Tangible Net Worth as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company to be less than the sum of (i) $246.1 million plus (ii) 25% of the Company's Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) (but only if a positive number) for each fiscal quarter ended subsequent to December 31, 2011 plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company's capital stock after December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2018, such sum was $366.8 million and the actual Tangible Net Worth of the Company was $536.5 million. \nAt December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants.\n4.03% Senior Notes Due in 2018\nOn April 21, 2011, the Company entered into a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. ( PIM\u201d), The Prudential Insurance Company of America and Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (collectively, the Purchaser\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million of its 4.03% Series A Senior Notes (the Series A Senior Notes\u201d) to the Purchaser. The Series A Senior Notes were an unsecured obligation of the Company, due on April 21, 2018. Interest on these notes was due semi-annually in arrears and the principal was due in five equal annual installments, with the first payment due on April 21, 2014. In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement allowed for the issuance and sale of additional senior notes to the Purchaser (the Shelf Notes\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, to mature no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life of no more than 10 years and to bear interest on the unpaid balance. The final $20.0 million principal payment under the Series A Senior Notes was made in April 2018 with no amount remaining outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\n3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021\nOn March 17, 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the Series B Senior Notes\u201d) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2021. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million.\n3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022\nOn November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the Series C Senior Notes\u201d) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net\nproceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company's revolving credit line. At December 31, 2018, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million.\nAmong other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series A Senior Notes, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement):\n \u2022 Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. \n \u2022 Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. \n \u2022 Permit tangible net worth, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than the sum of (i) $229.0 million, plus (ii) 25% of net income for such fiscal quarter subsequent to December 31, 2010, plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company's capital stock after December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2018, such sum was $366.8 million and the actual tangible net worth of the Company was $536.5 million. \nAt December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants.\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement ( 2016 Amendment\u201d) with the Purchaser. Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, (i) the issuance period for the shelf notes to be issued and sold pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement is extended until the earlier of February 9, 2019 or the termination of the issuance and sale of the shelf notes upon the 30 days' prior notice of either PIM or the Company, and (ii) the definition of the Available Facility Amount,\u201d which is the aggregate amount of the shelf notes that may be authorized for purchase pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement was amended to equal a formula based on: $250 million, minus the aggregate principal amount of the shelf notes then outstanding and purchased pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, minus the shelf notes accepted by the Company for purchase, but not yet purchased, by the Purchaser pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement; provided, however, the aggregate amount of the shelf notes purchased by any corporation or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, PIM shall not exceed $200 million.\nAlthough no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company's material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2021, outstanding amounts under our 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance. The table below provides a summary of the Company's contractual obligations and reflects expected payments due as of December 31, 2018 and does not reflect changes that could arise after that date.\nPayments Due by Period\n\nThe Company believes that its needs for working capital and capital expenditures through 2019 and beyond will be adequately met by operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and bank borrowings.\nPlease see the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 63 for a more detailed presentation of the sources and uses of the Company's cash.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn response to the SEC's Release No. 33-8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies,\u201d the Company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends. The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The Company has identified that its most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, depreciation, maintenance, repair and refurbishment, impairment of rental equipment and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Descriptions of these accounting policies are found in both the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nRevenue recognition:\nLease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases.\nNon-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company's promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company's best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation.\nDepreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company's experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness.\nThe lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers' selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies.\nChanges in useful lives or residual values will impact depreciation expense and any gain or loss from the sale of used equipment. Depending on the magnitude of such changes, the impact on the financial statements could be significant.\nMaintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company's policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. Changes in these policies could impact the Company's financial results.\nImpairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company's rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Additionally, if the Company decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the rental equipment, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell or dispose. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company assesses the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill and intangible assets annually or in interim periods if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The impairment review is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step process requires management to make certain judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step in the evaluation consists of estimating the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted cash flows using revenue and after tax profit estimates. Management then compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit's carrying amount, which includes goodwill and intangible assets. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and intangible assets and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets.\nImpact of Inflation\nAlthough the Company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation, from time to time it has experienced increases in costs of rental equipment, manufacturing costs, operating expenses and interest. Because a majority of its rentals are relatively short-term, the Company has generally been able to pass on such increased costs through increases in rental rates and selling prices, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to pass on increased costs to customers in the future.\nOff Balance Sheet Transactions\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements,\u201d as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent
