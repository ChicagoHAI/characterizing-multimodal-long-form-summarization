MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d contained herein.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2006 by EnerVest. Our general partner is EV Energy GP, a Delaware limited partnership, and the general partner of our general partner is EV Management, a Delaware limited liability company.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our oil and natural gas properties were located in the Barnett Shale, the San Juan Basin, the Appalachian Basin (which includes the Utica Shale), Michigan, Central Texas (which includes the Austin Chalk area), the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana, the Mid-Continent area in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana and the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2016, we had estimated net proved reserves of 12.6 MMBbls of oil, 575.3 Bcf of natural gas and 33.4 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, or 851.2 Bcfe, and a standardized measure of $371.1 million.\nCurrent Price Environment\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, these prices have been volatile, and we expect them to remain volatile. In late 2014, prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids declined precipitously, and prices remained low through 2015 and most of 2016. While prices showed some improvement during the second half of 2016 and the beginning of 2017, they have continued to fluctuate.\nFactors contributing to lower oil prices include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions of the world, particularly the Middle East; lower forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with excess global supply; actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Factors contributing to lower natural gas prices include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities; higher levels of natural gas in storage; and competition from other energy sources. Prices for natural gas liquids generally correlate to the price of oil and, accordingly, prices remain lower than historical levels and are likely to continue to directionally follow the market for oil.\nIn 2016, these low prices negatively affected our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and continued volatility in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Continued volatility or further declines in prices could also have a significant adverse impact on the value and quantities of our reserves, assuming no other changes in our development plans.\nAs specified by the SEC, the prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids used to calculate our reserves were the average prices during the year determined using the price on the first day of each month. The prices utilized in calculating our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were $42.75 per Bbl of oil and $2.481 per MMBtu of natural gas, which is significantly lower than current forward strip prices. Had we used the forward strip prices at December 31, 2016 through December 2029, we estimate that the present value (discounted at 10% per annum) of estimated future net revenues of our proved reserves would have been approximately 111% higher and that our reserves on an Mcfe basis would have been approximately 50% higher than our reserves calculated using SEC prices.\nOur Response to the Current Price Environment\nIn 2016, in response to continued lower prices, we took a number of actions to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility, including:\nTable 271: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>repurchased $82.7 million of our outstanding senior notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>reduced the amount of capital spending we dedicated to the development of our reserves by approximately 75%; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>continued to reduce operating and capital costs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>amended our credit facility to, among other things, ease the leverage covenants until 2018; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>continued to evaluate strategic divestitures such as our recent Barnett Shale divestiture and acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>reevaluated our common unit distribution policy and suspended our common unit distribution to conserve excess cash. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the steps above, as of December 31, 2016, we have over $205 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity, cash on hand and restricted cash. However, given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices beginning in 2017 relative to previous years, we have taken additional steps going forward into 2017 to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include:\nTable 278: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating costs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>increasing our capital spending budget to $30 - $45 million from $10.7 million in 2016, in an effort to maintain current production levels; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment, which includes continuing to assess the appropriate distribution levels every quarter; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties such as our Eagle Ford Acquisition in January 2017; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of acreage. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, the board of directors of EV Management announced that it had elected to suspend distributions for the first three quarters of 2016. The board of directors also elected to suspend distributions for the fourth quarter of 2016. The company continues to generate positive distributable cash flow, albeit at significantly lower levels than in previous years. The board of directors continues to evaluate the distribution on a quarterly basis and may elect to reinstate the distribution at the appropriate time when commodity prices and operating cash flows have increased to a level that can support a sustainable distribution.\nIn December 2016, we sold a portion of our Barnett Shale natural gas properties for $52.1 million (before post-closing adjustments), which proceeds were deposited into a 1031 \u2018like-kind' exchange account. On January 31, 2017, we acquired a 5.8% working interest in 9,151 gross acres (529 net acres) in Karnes County, TX for $58.7 million (before post-closing purchase price adjustments) with the proceeds and $6.6 million of borrowings under our credit facility (the Eagle Ford Acquisition\u201d). Certain EnerVest institutional partnerships own an 87% working interest in, and EnerVest acts as operator of, the properties.\nBusiness Environment\nOne of our primary business objectives is to generate sufficient excess cash flow that will allow us to reinstate a stable distribution, which we will be able to grow over time. Prior to reinstating distributions, we will ensure that we are, and will continue to be, in compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement. We are currently in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit agreement and, at current forward prices, expect to be in compliance through the end of 2017. At the end of first quarter of 2018, the leverage covenant in our credit agreement changes from a senior secured debt to EBITDAX ratio to a total debt to EBITDAX ratio. Based on current forward commodity prices, at the end of first quarter of 2018, we may have a total debt to EBITDAX ratio higher than the level prescribed in the most recent Ninth Amendment of our credit agreement. Absent a rebound in commodity prices, we currently project that we will not be in compliance with our leverage covenant at the end of the first quarter of 2018, and this may require us to make payments on our debt facilities or require us to work with our bank syndicate to amend our credit agreement. Our inability to amend our credit agreement or otherwise comply with the covenants in our credit agreement could have a material, adverse effect on our business, including our ability to resume and sustain distributions. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash generated from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\nTable 283: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the prices at which we will sell our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our ability to hedge commodity prices; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas we produce; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the level of our operating and administrative costs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn order to mitigate the impact of these lower prices on our cash flows, we are a party to derivatives, and we intend to enter into derivatives in the future to reduce the impact of price volatility on our cash flows. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our future production through March 2018, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future. We have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our cash flows from operations for those periods. An extended period of depressed commodity prices would alter our acquisition and development plans, adversely affect our growth strategy and our ability to access additional capital in the capital markets and reduce the cash we have available to pay distributions, which may require us to further delay our ability to reinstate our quarterly distribution amount.\nThe primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability, our ability to make accretive acquisitions, the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects. In addition, as initial reservoir pressures are depleted, production from our wells decreases. We attempt to overcome this natural decline through a combination of drilling and acquisitions. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions in excess of production. We will maintain our focus on the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves. Our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays in drilling, completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact our production, which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash available for distribution.\nWe focus our efforts on increasing our reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future cash flows from operations are dependent upon our ability to manage our overall cost structure.\nIn 2016, we spent significantly less capital drilling wells relative to previous years. As a result, we saw our total production decline throughout the year, when adjusting for the oil and natural gas properties that we acquired on October 1, 2015. For 2017, we plan to spend $30 - $45 million of capital in an effort to keep our production flat. We will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust plans in response to market conditions as needed.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities. Certain of our accounting policies involve estimates and assumptions to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as additional information is obtained, as more experience is acquired, as our operating environment changes and as new events occur.\nOur critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult, subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain. We would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements, which could be material, if we used different assumptions or estimates. We believe that the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 288: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOil and Natural Gas Properties\nWe account for our oil and natural gas properties using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs of productive exploratory wells, development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized. Oil and natural gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and natural gas leases, are charged to expense during the period the costs are incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities.\nNo gains or losses are recognized upon the disposition of proved oil and natural gas properties except in transactions such as the significant disposition of an amortizable base that significantly affects the unit-of-production amortization rate. Sales proceeds are credited to the carrying value of the properties.\nThe application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as development or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze, and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in quantities insufficient to be economic, which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. Wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature, and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results. Delineation seismic incurred to select development locations within an oil and natural gas field is typically considered a development cost and capitalized, but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions.\nThe successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding an oil and natural gas field that will be the focus of future developmental drilling activity. The initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed. Seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred.\nWe assess our proved oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Such events include a projection of future reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and future inflation levels. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, we recognize an impairment expense equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the property, which is estimated to be the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows are based on existing reserves, forecasted production and cost information and management's outlook of future commodity prices. Where probable and possible reserves exist, an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves is included in the impairment evaluation. The underlying commodity prices used in the determination of our estimated future net cash flows are based on NYMEX forward strip prices at the end of the period, adjusted by field or area for estimated location and quality differentials, as well as other trends and factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Future operating costs estimates, including appropriate escalators, are also developed based on a review of actual costs by field or area. Downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment.\nEstimates of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves\nOur estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimate. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance and material balance methods. Certain new producing properties with little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to offset production, both of which provide accurate forecasts. Non-producing reserve estimates for both developed and undeveloped properties were forecast using either volumetric and/or analogy methods. These methods provide accurate forecasts due to the mature nature of the properties targeted for development and an abundance of subsurface control data.\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workover costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Independent reserve engineers prepare our reserve estimates at the end of each year.\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize the costs of our oil and natural gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Our reserves are also the basis of our supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures.\nAccounting for Derivatives\nWe use derivatives to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated production for the next 12 - 36 months. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivatives. Accordingly, we carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet, with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the change occurs. Our current results of operations would potentially have been significantly different had we elected and qualified for hedge accounting on our derivatives.\nIn determining the amounts to be recorded, we are required to estimate the fair values of the derivatives. We base our estimates of fair value upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, volatility, the time value of options, our credit worthiness and the credit worthiness of the counterparties to our derivative instruments. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts and interest rates.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. In accounting for a business combination, the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based upon the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired net of the liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level.\nWe have the option of performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine if impairment may have occurred. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would be required to perform the two step impairment test.\nUnder the first step in the impairment test, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed. Under the second step in the impairment test, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by subtracting the estimated fair values of our reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of our reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on the quoted market price for our common units adjusted for a control premium, which is the premium over current market price a market participant may be willing to pay to obtain the synergies and other benefits that control would provide. Under the income approach, the fair value was based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value include estimates of the appropriate control premium, future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. Given the nature of these estimates and their application to specific assets and liabilities and time frames, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions.\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. Our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with site reclamation, dismantling facilities and plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.\nWe record an asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) and capitalize the asset retirement cost in oil and natural gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred based upon the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells. After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using an assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis.\nInherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions of these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance.\nRevenue Recognition\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at fixed or determinable prices, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and collectibility of the revenue is reasonably assured. Virtually all of our contracts' pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that prices fluctuate to remain competitive with other available suppliers.\nThere are two principal accounting practices to account for natural gas imbalances. These methods differ as to whether revenue is recognized based on the actual sale of natural gas (sales method) or an owner's entitled share of the current period's production (entitlement method). We follow the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenues. Under this method of accounting, revenues are recognized based on volumes sold, which may differ from the volume to which we are entitled based on our working interest. An imbalance is recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under-produced owner(s) to recoup its entitled share through future production. Under the sales method, no receivables are recorded where we have taken less than our share of production.\nWe own and operate a network of natural gas gathering systems in the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana which gather and transport owned natural gas and a small amount of third party natural gas to intrastate, interstate and local distribution pipelines. Natural gas gathering and transportation revenue is recognized when the natural gas has been delivered to a custody transfer point.\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (MBbls) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,052 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas liquids (MBbls) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas (MMcf) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,363 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net production (MMcfe) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,540 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average sales price per unit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (Bbl) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas liquids (Bbl) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas (Mcf) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mcfe </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average unit cost per Mcfe: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet loss for 2016 was $242.9 million compared with net income of $21.3 million for 2015. The significant factors in this change were (i) a $255.5 million decrease in income from discontinued operations; (ii) a $114.1 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives; partially offset by (iii) a $65.9 million decrease in impairment of goodwill; and (iv) a $23.7 million increase in gain on early extinguishment of debt.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for 2016 totaled $182.7 million, an increase of $7.6 million compared with 2015. This was the result of increases of $18.5 million related to increased oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production as a result of the October 2015 acquisitions offset by decreases of $10.9 million related to lower prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\nLease operating expenses for 2016 increased $3.7 million compared with 2015 as the result of $9.9 million from increased oil and natural gas production offset by $6.2 million from a lower cost per Mcfe. The lower unit cost per Mcfe reflects the downward trend in operating costs throughout the oil and natural gas industry. Lease operating expenses per Mcfe were $1.46 in 2016 compared with $1.56 in 2015.\nDry hole and exploration costs for 2016 decreased $3.0 million compared with 2015 as a result of our decreased drilling program during 2016.\nProduction taxes for 2016 increased $0.6 million compared with 2015 due to higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. Production taxes for 2016 were $0.10 per Mcfe compared with $0.11 per Mcfe for 2015.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) for 2016 increased $13.2 million compared with 2015 due to $11.5 million of increased oil and natural gas production combined with $1.7 million from a higher average DD&A rate per Mcfe. The higher average DD&A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates. DD&A for 2016 was $1.69 per Mcfe compared with $1.66 per Mcfe for 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2016 totaled $33.6 million, a decrease of $5.4 million compared with 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) $5.4 million of lower equity compensation costs, of which $2.3 million related to the accelerated vesting of the phantom units of a former officer in 2015; (ii) $1.3 million of decreased compensation costs, of which $0.8 million related to the vesting of our phantom units under our equity compensation plan; partially offset by (iii) $1.7 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement related to our October 2015 acquisition. General and administrative expenses were $0.48 per Mcfe in 2016 compared with $0.62 per Mcfe in 2015.\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of a reduction in estimated future net cash flows primarily caused by the decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the disposition of oil and gas properties, we incurred impairment charges of $131.3 million and $136.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, $89.5 million and $86.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to oil and natural gas properties that were written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. The $89.5 million of impairment for 2016 related to oil and natural gas properties in the Barnett Shale which were sold during December 2016 (see Note 5). Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2016 consisted of $41.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $35.8 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Appalachian Basin, primarily in the Utica Shale. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2015 consisted of $49.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $49.2 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Utica Shale.\nIn conjunction with our October 2015 acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, we recorded $65.9 million of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to the continued decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. We then determined the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the estimated fair values of the reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. As the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognized a $65.9 million impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn 2015, we recognized a gain of $0.6 million on the sale of certain non-core oil and natural gas properties.\nLoss on derivatives, net was $36.0 million for 2016 compared with a gain on derivatives, net of $78.1 million for 2015. This change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2016 for oil averaged $56.19 per Bbl compared with $40.45 at December 31, 2015, and the 12 month forward prices at December 31, 2016 for natural gas averaged $3.61 per MmBtu compared with $2.49 at December 31, 2015. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for oil averaged $40.45 per Bbl compared with $56.46 per Bbl at December 31, 2014, and the 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for natural gas averaged $2.49 per MmBtu compared with $3.03 at December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense for 2016 decreased $7.8 million compared with 2015 due to $9.4 million from a lower weighted average long-term debt balance, partially offset by $0.1 million from a higher weighted average effective interest rate and the write-off of $1.5 million of loan costs due to the reduction in the borrowing base and the redemption of the senior notes due April 2019.\nIn 2016, we recognized a $47.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $82.7 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million. In 2015, we recognized a $24.0 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $74.0 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million.\nIn 2016, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of tax benefits as a result of tax refunds and lower taxes. In December 2015, we converted our wholly-owned subsidiary Belden and Blake Corporation ( Belden\u201d) from a corporation into a single member limited liability company. As a result, the $13.4 million of deferred taxes recorded in the acquisition of Belden were realized. The benefit was offset by an $11.7 million current tax liability for the estimated federal and state taxes based on the fair value of Belden as of the date of conversion.\nIncome from discontinued operations was $255.5 million in 2015. Included in 2015 was the $246.7 million gain on the sale of UEO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet income for 2015 was $21.3 million compared with $129.7 million for 2014. The significant factors in this change were (i) a $159.6 million decrease in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues; (ii) a $32.8 million decrease in gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties; (iii) a $65.9 million impairment of goodwill; (iv) a $22.7 million increase in impairment of oil and natural gas properties; and (v) a $21.6 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives; offset by (v) a $148.0 million increase in income (loss) from discontinued operations; (vi) a $24.0 million gain on early extinguishment of debt and (vii) a $21.2 million decrease in operating costs and expenses (excluding impairment of oil and natural gas properties and impairment of goodwill).\nTable 294: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for 2015 totaled $175.1 million, a decrease of $159.6 million compared with 2014. This was the result of decreases of $159.8 million related to lower prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and $0.5 million from decreased oil production from our reduced capital spending program and natural decline offset by $0.7 million related to increased oil and natural gas production as a result of the October 2015 acquisitions.\nLease operating expenses for 2015 decreased $6.2 million compared with 2014 as the result of $6.6 million from a lower cost per Mcfe offset by $0.4 million from increased oil and natural gas production. The lower unit cost per Mcfe reflects the downward trend in operating costs throughout the oil and natural gas industry. Lease operating expenses per Mcfe were $1.56 in 2015 compared with $1.66 in 2014.\nDry hole and exploration costs for 2015 decreased $3.0 million compared with 2014 as a result of lower costs at certain of our oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin and the Austin Chalk.\nProduction taxes for 2015 decreased $5.2 million compared with 2014 due to lower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. Production taxes for 2015 were $0.11 per Mcfe compared with $0.19 per Mcfe for 2014.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) for 2015 decreased $0.1 million compared with 2014 due to $0.5 million from a lower average DD&A rate per Mcfe offset by $0.4 million of increased oil and natural gas production. The lower average DD&A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates and the decrease in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties from the impact of the impairments that were recognized in 2014. DD&A for 2015 was $1.66 per Mcfe compared with $1.67 per Mcfe for 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2015 totaled $39.0 million, a decrease of $6.0 million compared with 2014. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) $7.3 million of lower equity compensation costs; (ii) $1.0 million of costs incurred in 2014 related to the departure of a former officer; and (iii) $0.9 million of decreased compensation costs related to the vesting of our phantom units issued under our equity based compensation plan; offset by (iv) $2.1 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement, (v) $0.8 million of increased audit and reserve fees as a result of our October 2015 acquisitions; and (vi) $0.9 million of due diligence costs related to our October 2015 acquisitions. General and administrative expenses were $0.62 per Mcfe in 2015 compared with $0.71 per Mcfe in 2014.\nAs a result of a reduction in estimated future net cash flows primarily caused by the decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we incurred impairment charges of $136.7 million and $114.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts, $86.9 million and $103.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to oil and natural gas properties that were written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2015 consisted of $49.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $49.2 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Utica Shale. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2014 consisted of $10.7 million of leasehold impairment charges and $0.2 million of an impairment charge to write down assets held for sale to their fair value.\nIn conjunction with our October 2015 acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, we recorded $65.9 million of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to the continued decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. We then determined the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the estimated fair values of the reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. As the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognized a $65.9 million impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn 2015, we recognized a gain of $0.6 million on the sale of certain non-core oil and natural gas properties. In 2014, we recognized a $31.8 million gain on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in the Eagle Ford and a $1.5 million gain on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in the Utica Shale area of Ohio.\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain on derivatives, net was $78.1 million for 2015 compared with $99.7 million for 2014. This change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for oil averaged $40.45 per Bbl compared with $56.46 at December 31, 2014, and the 12 month forward prices at December 31, 2015 for natural gas averaged $2.49 per MmBtu compared with $3.03 at December 31, 2014. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2014 for oil averaged $56.46 per Bbl compared with $95.66 per Bbl at December 31, 2013, and the 12 month forward price at December 31, 2014 for natural gas averaged $3.03 per MmBtu compared with $4.19 at December 31, 2013.\nInterest expense for 2015 decreased $2.2 million compared with 2014 due to $10.6 million from a higher weighted effective average interest rate and $5.7 million from a decrease in capitalized interest offset by $18.5 million from a lower weighted average long-term debt balance.\nIn 2015, we recognized a $24.0 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $74.0 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million.\nIn December 2015, we converted Belden from a corporation into a single member limited liability company. As a result, the $13.4 million of deferred taxes recorded in the acquisition of Belden were realized. The benefit was offset by an $11.7 million current tax liability for the estimated federal and state taxes based on the fair value of Belden as of the date of conversion.\nIncome from discontinued operations was $255.5 million for 2015 compared with $107.5 million in 2014. Included in 2015 and 2014 were the $246.7 million gain on the sale of UEO and the $92.1 million gain of the sale of Cardinal, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity and capital have been issuances of equity and debt securities, borrowings under our credit facility and cash flows from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, development of our oil and natural gas properties, distributions to our unitholders and general partner and working capital needs.\nIn 2016, in response to continued lower prices, we took a number of actions, including repurchasing outstanding senior notes, reducing capital spending and operating costs, suspending distributions on our common units and strategic divestitures of non-core assets, to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. As a result of these steps, as of December 31, 2016, we have over $205 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity, cash on hand and restricted cash. However, given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices beginning in 2017 relative to previous years, we have taken additional steps going forward into 2017 to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include:\nTable 296: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating costs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>increasing our capital spending budget to $30 - $45 million from $10.7 million in 2016, in an effort to maintain current production levels; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment, which includes continuing to assess the appropriate distribution levels every quarter; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties such as our Eagle Ford Acquisition in January 2017; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of acreage. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, we believe that cash on hand, proceeds from sales of assets, net cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our capital budget and satisfy our short-term liquidity needs.\nWe may also utilize borrowings under our credit facility and various financing sources available to us, including the issuance of equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements, to fund our acquisitions and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to complete future offerings of equity or debt securities and the timing of these offerings will depend upon various factors including prevailing market conditions and our financial condition.\nTable 301: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have a $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in February 2020. Borrowings under the facility may not exceed a borrowing base\u201d determined by the lenders based on our oil and natural gas reserves. As of December 31, 2016, the borrowing base was $450.0 million, and we had $265.0 million outstanding. We believe we will maintain sufficient short-term liquidity. However, should prices decline significantly from current levels, the borrowing base could be reduced again in future redeterminations, which would impact our short-term liquidity.\nIn April 2016, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that eased leverage covenants and added an interest coverage ratio. Specifically, the amendment:\nTable 302: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>decreased the borrowing base to $450.0 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>changed the senior secured funded debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no greater than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, 3.0 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, 3.5 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, 4.0 to 1.0; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>changed the total funded debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no greater than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2018, 5.50 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018, 5.25 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018 and thereafter, 4.25 to 1.0; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>added an EBITDAX to cash interest expense ratio covenant to be no less than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, 2.5 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, 2.0 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and thereafter, 1.5 to 1.0; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>allowed for up to $35.0 million of cash, reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any quarterly distributions for the remainder of 2016, to be used for the redemption of our senior notes due April 2019; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>limited cash held by us to the greater of 5% of the current borrowing base or $30.0 million. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have $343.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of 8.0% senior notes due April 2019.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d contained herein.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $5.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, which included $0.7 million of short-term investments. With regard to our short-term investments, we invest in money market accounts with major financial institutions.\nRestricted Cash\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $52.1 million of restricted cash, which represents proceeds from the Barnett Shale divestiture we deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. In January 2017, these proceeds were used to fund, in part, the Eagle Ford Acquisition.\nTable 308: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCounterparty Exposure\nAll of our derivative contracts are with major financial institutions who are also lenders under our credit facility.

The significant factors in the change were $85.8 million of decreased cash settlements from our matured derivative contracts, an $11.7 million federal tax payment related to the conversion of an acquired corporation to a single member LLC and a $28.9 million change in working capital, primarily related to higher accounts receivable as a result of higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production during 2016.\nCash flows from operating activities provided $141.3 million and $148.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The significant factors in the change were a $161.1 million decrease in our revenues offset by $135.3 million of increased cash settlements from our matured derivative contracts and the effects of our efforts to increase our financial flexibility through asset sales and accretive acquisitions.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2016, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $9.8 million. This consisted of $52.1 million of restricted cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code and $15.3 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties offset by $54.5 million from the sale of oil and natural gas properties and $3.0 million in cash settlements from acquired derivative contracts.\nDuring 2015, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $280.4 million. This consisted of $250.4 million for acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, $67.9 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties offset by $33.8 million from the release of cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, $2.6 million in cash settlements from acquired derivative contracts and $1.5 million in proceeds from the sales of oil and natural gas properties. Net cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $572.2 million consisted of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in UEO.\nDuring 2014, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $93.8 million, consisting of $102.8 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties and an increase of $33.8 million related to cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code offset by $45.2 million in proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties. Net cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $47.0 million consisted of $161.1 million in proceeds from the sale of our interest in Cardinal offset by $114.1 million of additions to our investment in UEO.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2016, we received $57.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, repaid $57.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility, and paid distributions of $3.9 million to holders of our common units, phantom units and our general partner. We also redeemed $82.7 million of our senior notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million.\nDuring 2015, we repaid $561.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility with proceeds from the sale of our investment in UEO and the release of our restricted cash. We also redeemed $74.0 million of our senior notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million, received $295.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, incurred loan costs of $4.1 million related to the amendments of our credit facility and paid distributions of $101.0 million to holders of our common units, phantom units and our general partner.\nTable 310: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2014, we received $209.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, and we repaid $159.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility. In addition, we paid distributions of $155.0 million to holders of our common units and phantom units and our general partner.\nCapital Requirements\nWe currently expect spending in 2017 for additions to our oil and natural gas properties to be between $30 million and $45 million, an increase from the amounts spent in 2016. In addition, we spent $58.7 million (before post-closing purchase price adjustments) for the Eagle Ford Shale properties we acquired on January 31, 2017.\nWe expect to fund these amounts with cash on hand, restricted cash, proceeds from sales of assets, net cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe are actively engaged in the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. We would expect to finance any significant acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in 2017 through the issuance of equity or debt securities.\nContractual Obligations\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period (amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 - 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 - 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After 2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>608,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated interest payments (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transportation commitments (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligation (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>732,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest based on (i) the amount outstanding under our credit facility as of December 31, 2016 and the weighted average interest rate for 2016 of 3.75%, and (ii) our $343.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due April 2019.

Historically, prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d contained herein.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2006 by EnerVest. Our general partner is EV Energy GP, a Delaware limited partnership, and the general partner of our general partner is EV Management, a Delaware limited liability company.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our oil and natural gas properties were located in the Barnett Shale, the San Juan Basin, the Appalachian Basin (which includes the Utica Shale), Michigan, Central Texas (which includes the Austin Chalk area), the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana, the Mid-Continent area in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana and the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2016, we had estimated net proved reserves of 12.6 MMBbls of oil, 575.3 Bcf of natural gas and 33.4 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, or 851.2 Bcfe, and a standardized measure of $371.1 million.\nCurrent Price Environment\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, these prices have been volatile, and we expect them to remain volatile. In late 2014, prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids declined precipitously, and prices remained low through 2015 and most of 2016. While prices showed some improvement during the second half of 2016 and the beginning of 2017, they have continued to fluctuate.\nFactors contributing to lower oil prices include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions of the world, particularly the Middle East; lower forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with excess global supply; actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Factors contributing to lower natural gas prices include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities; higher levels of natural gas in storage; and competition from other energy sources. Prices for natural gas liquids generally correlate to the price of oil and, accordingly, prices remain lower than historical levels and are likely to continue to directionally follow the market for oil.\nIn 2016, these low prices negatively affected our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and continued volatility in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Continued volatility or further declines in prices could also have a significant adverse impact on the value and quantities of our reserves, assuming no other changes in our development plans.\nAs specified by the SEC, the prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids used to calculate our reserves were the average prices during the year determined using the price on the first day of each month. The prices utilized in calculating our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were $42.75 per Bbl of oil and $2.481 per MMBtu of natural gas, which is significantly lower than current forward strip prices. Had we used the forward strip prices at December 31, 2016 through December 2029, we estimate that the present value (discounted at 10% per annum) of estimated future net revenues of our proved reserves would have been approximately 111% higher and that our reserves on an Mcfe basis would have been approximately 50% higher than our reserves calculated using SEC prices.\nOur Response to the Current Price Environment\nIn 2016, in response to continued lower prices, we took a number of actions to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility, including:\n \u00b7 repurchased $82.7 million of our outstanding senior notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million; \n \u00b7 reduced the amount of capital spending we dedicated to the development of our reserves by approximately 75%; \n \u00b7 continued to reduce operating and capital costs; \n \u00b7 amended our credit facility to, among other things, ease the leverage covenants until 2018; \n 56 \n \u00b7 continued to evaluate strategic divestitures such as our recent Barnett Shale divestiture and acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties; and \n \u00b7 reevaluated our common unit distribution policy and suspended our common unit distribution to conserve excess cash. \nAs a result of the steps above, as of December 31, 2016, we have over $205 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity, cash on hand and restricted cash. However, given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices beginning in 2017 relative to previous years, we have taken additional steps going forward into 2017 to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include:\n \u00b7 focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating costs; \n \u00b7 increasing our capital spending budget to $30 - $45 million from $10.7 million in 2016, in an effort to maintain current production levels; \n \u00b7 maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment, which includes continuing to assess the appropriate distribution levels every quarter; \n \u00b7 continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties such as our Eagle Ford Acquisition in January 2017; and \n \u00b7 further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of acreage. \nDuring 2016, the board of directors of EV Management announced that it had elected to suspend distributions for the first three quarters of 2016. The board of directors also elected to suspend distributions for the fourth quarter of 2016. The company continues to generate positive distributable cash flow, albeit at significantly lower levels than in previous years. The board of directors continues to evaluate the distribution on a quarterly basis and may elect to reinstate the distribution at the appropriate time when commodity prices and operating cash flows have increased to a level that can support a sustainable distribution.\nIn December 2016, we sold a portion of our Barnett Shale natural gas properties for $52.1 million (before post-closing adjustments), which proceeds were deposited into a 1031 \u2018like-kind' exchange account. On January 31, 2017, we acquired a 5.8% working interest in 9,151 gross acres (529 net acres) in Karnes County, TX for $58.7 million (before post-closing purchase price adjustments) with the proceeds and $6.6 million of borrowings under our credit facility (the Eagle Ford Acquisition\u201d). Certain EnerVest institutional partnerships own an 87% working interest in, and EnerVest acts as operator of, the properties.\nBusiness Environment\nOne of our primary business objectives is to generate sufficient excess cash flow that will allow us to reinstate a stable distribution, which we will be able to grow over time. Prior to reinstating distributions, we will ensure that we are, and will continue to be, in compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement. We are currently in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit agreement and, at current forward prices, expect to be in compliance through the end of 2017. At the end of first quarter of 2018, the leverage covenant in our credit agreement changes from a senior secured debt to EBITDAX ratio to a total debt to EBITDAX ratio. Based on current forward commodity prices, at the end of first quarter of 2018, we may have a total debt to EBITDAX ratio higher than the level prescribed in the most recent Ninth Amendment of our credit agreement. Absent a rebound in commodity prices, we currently project that we will not be in compliance with our leverage covenant at the end of the first quarter of 2018, and this may require us to make payments on our debt facilities or require us to work with our bank syndicate to amend our credit agreement. Our inability to amend our credit agreement or otherwise comply with the covenants in our credit agreement could have a material, adverse effect on our business, including our ability to resume and sustain distributions. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash generated from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n \u00b7 the prices at which we will sell our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production; \n 57 \n \u00b7 our ability to hedge commodity prices; \n \u00b7 the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas we produce; and \n \u00b7 the level of our operating and administrative costs. \nIn order to mitigate the impact of these lower prices on our cash flows, we are a party to derivatives, and we intend to enter into derivatives in the future to reduce the impact of price volatility on our cash flows. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our future production through March 2018, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future. We have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our cash flows from operations for those periods. An extended period of depressed commodity prices would alter our acquisition and development plans, adversely affect our growth strategy and our ability to access additional capital in the capital markets and reduce the cash we have available to pay distributions, which may require us to further delay our ability to reinstate our quarterly distribution amount.\nThe primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability, our ability to make accretive acquisitions, the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects. In addition, as initial reservoir pressures are depleted, production from our wells decreases. We attempt to overcome this natural decline through a combination of drilling and acquisitions. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions in excess of production. We will maintain our focus on the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves. Our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays in drilling, completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact our production, which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash available for distribution.\nWe focus our efforts on increasing our reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future cash flows from operations are dependent upon our ability to manage our overall cost structure.\nIn 2016, we spent significantly less capital drilling wells relative to previous years. As a result, we saw our total production decline throughout the year, when adjusting for the oil and natural gas properties that we acquired on October 1, 2015. For 2017, we plan to spend $30 - $45 million of capital in an effort to keep our production flat. We will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust plans in response to market conditions as needed.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities. Certain of our accounting policies involve estimates and assumptions to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as additional information is obtained, as more experience is acquired, as our operating environment changes and as new events occur.\nOur critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult, subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain. We would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements, which could be material, if we used different assumptions or estimates. We believe that the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n 58 \nOil and Natural Gas Properties\nWe account for our oil and natural gas properties using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs of productive exploratory wells, development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized. Oil and natural gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and natural gas leases, are charged to expense during the period the costs are incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities.\nNo gains or losses are recognized upon the disposition of proved oil and natural gas properties except in transactions such as the significant disposition of an amortizable base that significantly affects the unit-of-production amortization rate. Sales proceeds are credited to the carrying value of the properties.\nThe application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as development or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze, and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in quantities insufficient to be economic, which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. Wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature, and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results. Delineation seismic incurred to select development locations within an oil and natural gas field is typically considered a development cost and capitalized, but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions.\nThe successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding an oil and natural gas field that will be the focus of future developmental drilling activity. The initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed. Seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred.\nWe assess our proved oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Such events include a projection of future reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and future inflation levels. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, we recognize an impairment expense equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the property, which is estimated to be the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows are based on existing reserves, forecasted production and cost information and management's outlook of future commodity prices. Where probable and possible reserves exist, an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves is included in the impairment evaluation. The underlying commodity prices used in the determination of our estimated future net cash flows are based on NYMEX forward strip prices at the end of the period, adjusted by field or area for estimated location and quality differentials, as well as other trends and factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Future operating costs estimates, including appropriate escalators, are also developed based on a review of actual costs by field or area. Downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment.\nEstimates of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves\nOur estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimate. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance and material balance methods. Certain new producing properties with little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to offset production, both of which provide accurate forecasts. Non-producing reserve estimates for both developed and undeveloped properties were forecast using either volumetric and/or analogy methods. These methods provide accurate forecasts due to the mature nature of the properties targeted for development and an abundance of subsurface control data.\n 59 \nThe accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workover costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Independent reserve engineers prepare our reserve estimates at the end of each year.\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize the costs of our oil and natural gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Our reserves are also the basis of our supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures.\nAccounting for Derivatives\nWe use derivatives to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated production for the next 12 - 36 months. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivatives. Accordingly, we carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet, with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the change occurs. Our current results of operations would potentially have been significantly different had we elected and qualified for hedge accounting on our derivatives.\nIn determining the amounts to be recorded, we are required to estimate the fair values of the derivatives. We base our estimates of fair value upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, volatility, the time value of options, our credit worthiness and the credit worthiness of the counterparties to our derivative instruments. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts and interest rates.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. In accounting for a business combination, the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based upon the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired net of the liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level.\nWe have the option of performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine if impairment may have occurred. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would be required to perform the two step impairment test.\nUnder the first step in the impairment test, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed. Under the second step in the impairment test, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by subtracting the estimated fair values of our reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of our reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on the quoted market price for our common units adjusted for a control premium, which is the premium over current market price a market participant may be willing to pay to obtain the synergies and other benefits that control would provide. Under the income approach, the fair value was based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value include estimates of the appropriate control premium, future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. Given the nature of these estimates and their application to specific assets and liabilities and time frames, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions.\n 60 \nAccounting for Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. Our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with site reclamation, dismantling facilities and plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.\nWe record an asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) and capitalize the asset retirement cost in oil and natural gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred based upon the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells. After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using an assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis.\nInherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions of these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance.\nRevenue Recognition\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at fixed or determinable prices, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and collectibility of the revenue is reasonably assured. Virtually all of our contracts' pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that prices fluctuate to remain competitive with other available suppliers.\nThere are two principal accounting practices to account for natural gas imbalances. These methods differ as to whether revenue is recognized based on the actual sale of natural gas (sales method) or an owner's entitled share of the current period's production (entitlement method). We follow the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenues. Under this method of accounting, revenues are recognized based on volumes sold, which may differ from the volume to which we are entitled based on our working interest. An imbalance is recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under-produced owner(s) to recoup its entitled share through future production. Under the sales method, no receivables are recorded where we have taken less than our share of production.\nWe own and operate a network of natural gas gathering systems in the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana which gather and transport owned natural gas and a small amount of third party natural gas to intrastate, interstate and local distribution pipelines. Natural gas gathering and transportation revenue is recognized when the natural gas has been delivered to a custody transfer point.\n 61 \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (MBbls) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,052 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas liquids (MBbls) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas (MMcf) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,363 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net production (MMcfe) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,540 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average sales price per unit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (Bbl) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas liquids (Bbl) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas (Mcf) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mcfe </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average unit cost per Mcfe: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet loss for 2016 was $242.9 million compared with net income of $21.3 million for 2015. The significant factors in this change were (i) a $255.5 million decrease in income from discontinued operations; (ii) a $114.1 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives; partially offset by (iii) a $65.9 million decrease in impairment of goodwill; and (iv) a $23.7 million increase in gain on early extinguishment of debt.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for 2016 totaled $182.7 million, an increase of $7.6 million compared with 2015. This was the result of increases of $18.5 million related to increased oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production as a result of the October 2015 acquisitions offset by decreases of $10.9 million related to lower prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\nLease operating expenses for 2016 increased $3.7 million compared with 2015 as the result of $9.9 million from increased oil and natural gas production offset by $6.2 million from a lower cost per Mcfe. The lower unit cost per Mcfe reflects the downward trend in operating costs throughout the oil and natural gas industry. Lease operating expenses per Mcfe were $1.46 in 2016 compared with $1.56 in 2015.\nDry hole and exploration costs for 2016 decreased $3.0 million compared with 2015 as a result of our decreased drilling program during 2016.\nProduction taxes for 2016 increased $0.6 million compared with 2015 due to higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. Production taxes for 2016 were $0.10 per Mcfe compared with $0.11 per Mcfe for 2015.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) for 2016 increased $13.2 million compared with 2015 due to $11.5 million of increased oil and natural gas production combined with $1.7 million from a higher average DD&A rate per Mcfe. The higher average DD&A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates. DD&A for 2016 was $1.69 per Mcfe compared with $1.66 per Mcfe for 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2016 totaled $33.6 million, a decrease of $5.4 million compared with 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) $5.4 million of lower equity compensation costs, of which $2.3 million related to the accelerated vesting of the phantom units of a former officer in 2015; (ii) $1.3 million of decreased compensation costs, of which $0.8 million related to the vesting of our phantom units under our equity compensation plan; partially offset by (iii) $1.7 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement related to our October 2015 acquisition. General and administrative expenses were $0.48 per Mcfe in 2016 compared with $0.62 per Mcfe in 2015.\n 62 \nAs a result of a reduction in estimated future net cash flows primarily caused by the decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the disposition of oil and gas properties, we incurred impairment charges of $131.3 million and $136.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, $89.5 million and $86.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to oil and natural gas properties that were written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. The $89.5 million of impairment for 2016 related to oil and natural gas properties in the Barnett Shale which were sold during December 2016 (see Note 5). Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2016 consisted of $41.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $35.8 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Appalachian Basin, primarily in the Utica Shale. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2015 consisted of $49.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $49.2 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Utica Shale.\nIn conjunction with our October 2015 acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, we recorded $65.9 million of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to the continued decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. We then determined the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the estimated fair values of the reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. As the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognized a $65.9 million impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn 2015, we recognized a gain of $0.6 million on the sale of certain non-core oil and natural gas properties.\nLoss on derivatives, net was $36.0 million for 2016 compared with a gain on derivatives, net of $78.1 million for 2015. This change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2016 for oil averaged $56.19 per Bbl compared with $40.45 at December 31, 2015, and the 12 month forward prices at December 31, 2016 for natural gas averaged $3.61 per MmBtu compared with $2.49 at December 31, 2015. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for oil averaged $40.45 per Bbl compared with $56.46 per Bbl at December 31, 2014, and the 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for natural gas averaged $2.49 per MmBtu compared with $3.03 at December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense for 2016 decreased $7.8 million compared with 2015 due to $9.4 million from a lower weighted average long-term debt balance, partially offset by $0.1 million from a higher weighted average effective interest rate and the write-off of $1.5 million of loan costs due to the reduction in the borrowing base and the redemption of the senior notes due April 2019.\nIn 2016, we recognized a $47.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $82.7 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million. In 2015, we recognized a $24.0 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $74.0 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million.\nIn 2016, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of tax benefits as a result of tax refunds and lower taxes. In December 2015, we converted our wholly-owned subsidiary Belden and Blake Corporation ( Belden\u201d) from a corporation into a single member limited liability company. As a result, the $13.4 million of deferred taxes recorded in the acquisition of Belden were realized. The benefit was offset by an $11.7 million current tax liability for the estimated federal and state taxes based on the fair value of Belden as of the date of conversion.\nIncome from discontinued operations was $255.5 million in 2015. Included in 2015 was the $246.7 million gain on the sale of UEO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet income for 2015 was $21.3 million compared with $129.7 million for 2014. The significant factors in this change were (i) a $159.6 million decrease in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues; (ii) a $32.8 million decrease in gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties; (iii) a $65.9 million impairment of goodwill; (iv) a $22.7 million increase in impairment of oil and natural gas properties; and (v) a $21.6 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives; offset by (v) a $148.0 million increase in income (loss) from discontinued operations; (vi) a $24.0 million gain on early extinguishment of debt and (vii) a $21.2 million decrease in operating costs and expenses (excluding impairment of oil and natural gas properties and impairment of goodwill).\n 63 \nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for 2015 totaled $175.1 million, a decrease of $159.6 million compared with 2014. This was the result of decreases of $159.8 million related to lower prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and $0.5 million from decreased oil production from our reduced capital spending program and natural decline offset by $0.7 million related to increased oil and natural gas production as a result of the October 2015 acquisitions.\nLease operating expenses for 2015 decreased $6.2 million compared with 2014 as the result of $6.6 million from a lower cost per Mcfe offset by $0.4 million from increased oil and natural gas production. The lower unit cost per Mcfe reflects the downward trend in operating costs throughout the oil and natural gas industry. Lease operating expenses per Mcfe were $1.56 in 2015 compared with $1.66 in 2014.\nDry hole and exploration costs for 2015 decreased $3.0 million compared with 2014 as a result of lower costs at certain of our oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin and the Austin Chalk.\nProduction taxes for 2015 decreased $5.2 million compared with 2014 due to lower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. Production taxes for 2015 were $0.11 per Mcfe compared with $0.19 per Mcfe for 2014.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) for 2015 decreased $0.1 million compared with 2014 due to $0.5 million from a lower average DD&A rate per Mcfe offset by $0.4 million of increased oil and natural gas production. The lower average DD&A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates and the decrease in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties from the impact of the impairments that were recognized in 2014. DD&A for 2015 was $1.66 per Mcfe compared with $1.67 per Mcfe for 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2015 totaled $39.0 million, a decrease of $6.0 million compared with 2014. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) $7.3 million of lower equity compensation costs; (ii) $1.0 million of costs incurred in 2014 related to the departure of a former officer; and (iii) $0.9 million of decreased compensation costs related to the vesting of our phantom units issued under our equity based compensation plan; offset by (iv) $2.1 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement, (v) $0.8 million of increased audit and reserve fees as a result of our October 2015 acquisitions; and (vi) $0.9 million of due diligence costs related to our October 2015 acquisitions. General and administrative expenses were $0.62 per Mcfe in 2015 compared with $0.71 per Mcfe in 2014.\nAs a result of a reduction in estimated future net cash flows primarily caused by the decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we incurred impairment charges of $136.7 million and $114.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts, $86.9 million and $103.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to oil and natural gas properties that were written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2015 consisted of $49.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $49.2 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Utica Shale. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2014 consisted of $10.7 million of leasehold impairment charges and $0.2 million of an impairment charge to write down assets held for sale to their fair value.\nIn conjunction with our October 2015 acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, we recorded $65.9 million of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to the continued decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. We then determined the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the estimated fair values of the reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. As the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognized a $65.9 million impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn 2015, we recognized a gain of $0.6 million on the sale of certain non-core oil and natural gas properties. In 2014, we recognized a $31.8 million gain on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in the Eagle Ford and a $1.5 million gain on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in the Utica Shale area of Ohio.\n 64 \nGain on derivatives, net was $78.1 million for 2015 compared with $99.7 million for 2014. This change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for oil averaged $40.45 per Bbl compared with $56.46 at December 31, 2014, and the 12 month forward prices at December 31, 2015 for natural gas averaged $2.49 per MmBtu compared with $3.03 at December 31, 2014. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2014 for oil averaged $56.46 per Bbl compared with $95.66 per Bbl at December 31, 2013, and the 12 month forward price at December 31, 2014 for natural gas averaged $3.03 per MmBtu compared with $4.19 at December 31, 2013.\nInterest expense for 2015 decreased $2.2 million compared with 2014 due to $10.6 million from a higher weighted effective average interest rate and $5.7 million from a decrease in capitalized interest offset by $18.5 million from a lower weighted average long-term debt balance.\nIn 2015, we recognized a $24.0 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $74.0 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million.\nIn December 2015, we converted Belden from a corporation into a single member limited liability company. As a result, the $13.4 million of deferred taxes recorded in the acquisition of Belden were realized. The benefit was offset by an $11.7 million current tax liability for the estimated federal and state taxes based on the fair value of Belden as of the date of conversion.\nIncome from discontinued operations was $255.5 million for 2015 compared with $107.5 million in 2014. Included in 2015 and 2014 were the $246.7 million gain on the sale of UEO and the $92.1 million gain of the sale of Cardinal, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity and capital have been issuances of equity and debt securities, borrowings under our credit facility and cash flows from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, development of our oil and natural gas properties, distributions to our unitholders and general partner and working capital needs.\nIn 2016, in response to continued lower prices, we took a number of actions, including repurchasing outstanding senior notes, reducing capital spending and operating costs, suspending distributions on our common units and strategic divestitures of non-core assets, to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. As a result of these steps, as of December 31, 2016, we have over $205 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity, cash on hand and restricted cash. However, given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices beginning in 2017 relative to previous years, we have taken additional steps going forward into 2017 to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include:\n \u00b7 focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating costs; \n \u00b7 increasing our capital spending budget to $30 - $45 million from $10.7 million in 2016, in an effort to maintain current production levels; \n \u00b7 maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment, which includes continuing to assess the appropriate distribution levels every quarter; \n \u00b7 continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties such as our Eagle Ford Acquisition in January 2017; and \n \u00b7 further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of acreage. \nFor 2017, we believe that cash on hand, proceeds from sales of assets, net cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our capital budget and satisfy our short-term liquidity needs.\nWe may also utilize borrowings under our credit facility and various financing sources available to us, including the issuance of equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements, to fund our acquisitions and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to complete future offerings of equity or debt securities and the timing of these offerings will depend upon various factors including prevailing market conditions and our financial condition.\n 65 \nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have a $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in February 2020. Borrowings under the facility may not exceed a borrowing base\u201d determined by the lenders based on our oil and natural gas reserves. As of December 31, 2016, the borrowing base was $450.0 million, and we had $265.0 million outstanding. We believe we will maintain sufficient short-term liquidity. However, should prices decline significantly from current levels, the borrowing base could be reduced again in future redeterminations, which would impact our short-term liquidity.\nIn April 2016, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that eased leverage covenants and added an interest coverage ratio. Specifically, the amendment:\n \u00b7 decreased the borrowing base to $450.0 million; \n \u00b7 changed the senior secured funded debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no greater than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, 3.0 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, 3.5 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, 4.0 to 1.0; \n \u00b7 changed the total funded debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no greater than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2018, 5.50 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018, 5.25 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018 and thereafter, 4.25 to 1.0; \n \u00b7 added an EBITDAX to cash interest expense ratio covenant to be no less than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, 2.5 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, 2.0 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and thereafter, 1.5 to 1.0; \n \u00b7 allowed for up to $35.0 million of cash, reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any quarterly distributions for the remainder of 2016, to be used for the redemption of our senior notes due April 2019; and \n \u00b7 limited cash held by us to the greater of 5% of the current borrowing base or $30.0 million. \nAs of December 31, 2016, we have $343.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of 8.0% senior notes due April 2019. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate carrying amount of the senior notes due April 2019 was $341.9 million.\nFor additional information about our long-term debt, such as interest rates and covenants, please see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d contained herein.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $5.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, which included $0.7 million of short-term investments. With regard to our short-term investments, we invest in money market accounts with major financial institutions.\nRestricted Cash\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $52.1 million of restricted cash, which represents proceeds from the Barnett Shale divestiture we deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. In January 2017, these proceeds were used to fund, in part, the Eagle Ford Acquisition.\n 66 \nCounterparty Exposure\nAll of our derivative contracts are with major financial institutions who are also lenders under our credit facility. Should one of these financial counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our derivative contracts and we could incur a loss.

The significant factors in the change were $85.8 million of decreased cash settlements from our matured derivative contracts, an $11.7 million federal tax payment related to the conversion of an acquired corporation to a single member LLC and a $28.9 million change in working capital, primarily related to higher accounts receivable as a result of higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production during 2016.\nCash flows from operating activities provided $141.3 million and $148.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The significant factors in the change were a $161.1 million decrease in our revenues offset by $135.3 million of increased cash settlements from our matured derivative contracts and the effects of our efforts to increase our financial flexibility through asset sales and accretive acquisitions.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2016, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $9.8 million. This consisted of $52.1 million of restricted cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code and $15.3 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties offset by $54.5 million from the sale of oil and natural gas properties and $3.0 million in cash settlements from acquired derivative contracts.\nDuring 2015, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $280.4 million. This consisted of $250.4 million for acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, $67.9 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties offset by $33.8 million from the release of cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, $2.6 million in cash settlements from acquired derivative contracts and $1.5 million in proceeds from the sales of oil and natural gas properties. Net cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $572.2 million consisted of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in UEO.\nDuring 2014, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $93.8 million, consisting of $102.8 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties and an increase of $33.8 million related to cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code offset by $45.2 million in proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties. Net cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $47.0 million consisted of $161.1 million in proceeds from the sale of our interest in Cardinal offset by $114.1 million of additions to our investment in UEO.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2016, we received $57.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, repaid $57.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility, and paid distributions of $3.9 million to holders of our common units, phantom units and our general partner. We also redeemed $82.7 million of our senior notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million.\nDuring 2015, we repaid $561.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility with proceeds from the sale of our investment in UEO and the release of our restricted cash. We also redeemed $74.0 million of our senior notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million, received $295.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, incurred loan costs of $4.1 million related to the amendments of our credit facility and paid distributions of $101.0 million to holders of our common units, phantom units and our general partner.\n 67 \nDuring 2014, we received $209.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, and we repaid $159.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility. In addition, we paid distributions of $155.0 million to holders of our common units and phantom units and our general partner.\nCapital Requirements\nWe currently expect spending in 2017 for additions to our oil and natural gas properties to be between $30 million and $45 million, an increase from the amounts spent in 2016. In addition, we spent $58.7 million (before post-closing purchase price adjustments) for the Eagle Ford Shale properties we acquired on January 31, 2017.\nWe expect to fund these amounts with cash on hand, restricted cash, proceeds from sales of assets, net cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe are actively engaged in the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. We would expect to finance any significant acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in 2017 through the issuance of equity or debt securities.\nContractual Obligations\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period (amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 - 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 - 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After 2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>608,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated interest payments (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transportation commitments (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligation (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>732,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest based on (i) the amount outstanding under our credit facility as of December 31, 2016 and the weighted average interest rate for 2016 of 3.75%, and (ii) our $343.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due April 2019.

Historically, prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d contained herein.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2006 by EnerVest. Our general partner is EV Energy GP, a Delaware limited partnership, and the general partner of our general partner is EV Management, a Delaware limited liability company.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our oil and natural gas properties were located in the Barnett Shale, the San Juan Basin, the Appalachian Basin (which includes the Utica Shale), Michigan, Central Texas (which includes the Austin Chalk area), the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana, the Mid-Continent area in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana and the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2016, we had estimated net proved reserves of 12.6 MMBbls of oil, 575.3 Bcf of natural gas and 33.4 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, or 851.2 Bcfe, and a standardized measure of $371.1 million.\nCurrent Price Environment\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, these prices have been volatile, and we expect them to remain volatile. In late 2014, prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids declined precipitously, and prices remained low through 2015 and most of 2016. While prices showed some improvement during the second half of 2016 and the beginning of 2017, they have continued to fluctuate.\nFactors contributing to lower oil prices include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions of the world, particularly the Middle East; lower forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with excess global supply; actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Factors contributing to lower natural gas prices include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities; higher levels of natural gas in storage; and competition from other energy sources. Prices for natural gas liquids generally correlate to the price of oil and, accordingly, prices remain lower than historical levels and are likely to continue to directionally follow the market for oil.\nIn 2016, these low prices negatively affected our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and continued volatility in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Continued volatility or further declines in prices could also have a significant adverse impact on the value and quantities of our reserves, assuming no other changes in our development plans.\nAs specified by the SEC, the prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids used to calculate our reserves were the average prices during the year determined using the price on the first day of each month. The prices utilized in calculating our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were $42.75 per Bbl of oil and $2.481 per MMBtu of natural gas, which is significantly lower than current forward strip prices. Had we used the forward strip prices at December 31, 2016 through December 2029, we estimate that the present value (discounted at 10% per annum) of estimated future net revenues of our proved reserves would have been approximately 111% higher and that our reserves on an Mcfe basis would have been approximately 50% higher than our reserves calculated using SEC prices.\nOur Response to the Current Price Environment\nIn 2016, in response to continued lower prices, we took a number of actions to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility, including:\n \u00b7 repurchased $82.7 million of our outstanding senior notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million; \n \u00b7 reduced the amount of capital spending we dedicated to the development of our reserves by approximately 75%; \n \u00b7 continued to reduce operating and capital costs; \n \u00b7 amended our credit facility to, among other things, ease the leverage covenants until 2018; \n 56 \n \u00b7 continued to evaluate strategic divestitures such as our recent Barnett Shale divestiture and acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties; and \n \u00b7 reevaluated our common unit distribution policy and suspended our common unit distribution to conserve excess cash. \nAs a result of the steps above, as of December 31, 2016, we have over $205 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity, cash on hand and restricted cash. However, given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices beginning in 2017 relative to previous years, we have taken additional steps going forward into 2017 to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include:\n \u00b7 focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating costs; \n \u00b7 increasing our capital spending budget to $30 - $45 million from $10.7 million in 2016, in an effort to maintain current production levels; \n \u00b7 maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment, which includes continuing to assess the appropriate distribution levels every quarter; \n \u00b7 continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties such as our Eagle Ford Acquisition in January 2017; and \n \u00b7 further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of acreage. \nDuring 2016, the board of directors of EV Management announced that it had elected to suspend distributions for the first three quarters of 2016. The board of directors also elected to suspend distributions for the fourth quarter of 2016. The company continues to generate positive distributable cash flow, albeit at significantly lower levels than in previous years. The board of directors continues to evaluate the distribution on a quarterly basis and may elect to reinstate the distribution at the appropriate time when commodity prices and operating cash flows have increased to a level that can support a sustainable distribution.\nIn December 2016, we sold a portion of our Barnett Shale natural gas properties for $52.1 million (before post-closing adjustments), which proceeds were deposited into a 1031 \u2018like-kind' exchange account. On January 31, 2017, we acquired a 5.8% working interest in 9,151 gross acres (529 net acres) in Karnes County, TX for $58.7 million (before post-closing purchase price adjustments) with the proceeds and $6.6 million of borrowings under our credit facility (the Eagle Ford Acquisition\u201d). Certain EnerVest institutional partnerships own an 87% working interest in, and EnerVest acts as operator of, the properties.\nBusiness Environment\nOne of our primary business objectives is to generate sufficient excess cash flow that will allow us to reinstate a stable distribution, which we will be able to grow over time. Prior to reinstating distributions, we will ensure that we are, and will continue to be, in compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement. We are currently in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit agreement and, at current forward prices, expect to be in compliance through the end of 2017. At the end of first quarter of 2018, the leverage covenant in our credit agreement changes from a senior secured debt to EBITDAX ratio to a total debt to EBITDAX ratio. Based on current forward commodity prices, at the end of first quarter of 2018, we may have a total debt to EBITDAX ratio higher than the level prescribed in the most recent Ninth Amendment of our credit agreement. Absent a rebound in commodity prices, we currently project that we will not be in compliance with our leverage covenant at the end of the first quarter of 2018, and this may require us to make payments on our debt facilities or require us to work with our bank syndicate to amend our credit agreement. Our inability to amend our credit agreement or otherwise comply with the covenants in our credit agreement could have a material, adverse effect on our business, including our ability to resume and sustain distributions. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash generated from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n \u00b7 the prices at which we will sell our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production; \n 57 \n \u00b7 our ability to hedge commodity prices; \n \u00b7 the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas we produce; and \n \u00b7 the level of our operating and administrative costs. \nIn order to mitigate the impact of these lower prices on our cash flows, we are a party to derivatives, and we intend to enter into derivatives in the future to reduce the impact of price volatility on our cash flows. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our future production through March 2018, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future. We have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our cash flows from operations for those periods. An extended period of depressed commodity prices would alter our acquisition and development plans, adversely affect our growth strategy and our ability to access additional capital in the capital markets and reduce the cash we have available to pay distributions, which may require us to further delay our ability to reinstate our quarterly distribution amount.\nThe primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability, our ability to make accretive acquisitions, the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects. In addition, as initial reservoir pressures are depleted, production from our wells decreases. We attempt to overcome this natural decline through a combination of drilling and acquisitions. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions in excess of production. We will maintain our focus on the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves. Our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays in drilling, completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact our production, which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash available for distribution.\nWe focus our efforts on increasing our reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future cash flows from operations are dependent upon our ability to manage our overall cost structure.\nIn 2016, we spent significantly less capital drilling wells relative to previous years. As a result, we saw our total production decline throughout the year, when adjusting for the oil and natural gas properties that we acquired on October 1, 2015. For 2017, we plan to spend $30 - $45 million of capital in an effort to keep our production flat. We will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust plans in response to market conditions as needed.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities. Certain of our accounting policies involve estimates and assumptions to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as additional information is obtained, as more experience is acquired, as our operating environment changes and as new events occur.\nOur critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult, subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain. We would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements, which could be material, if we used different assumptions or estimates. We believe that the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n 58 \nOil and Natural Gas Properties\nWe account for our oil and natural gas properties using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs of productive exploratory wells, development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized. Oil and natural gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and natural gas leases, are charged to expense during the period the costs are incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities.\nNo gains or losses are recognized upon the disposition of proved oil and natural gas properties except in transactions such as the significant disposition of an amortizable base that significantly affects the unit-of-production amortization rate. Sales proceeds are credited to the carrying value of the properties.\nThe application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as development or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze, and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in quantities insufficient to be economic, which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. Wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature, and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results. Delineation seismic incurred to select development locations within an oil and natural gas field is typically considered a development cost and capitalized, but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions.\nThe successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding an oil and natural gas field that will be the focus of future developmental drilling activity. The initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed. Seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred.\nWe assess our proved oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Such events include a projection of future reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and future inflation levels. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, we recognize an impairment expense equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the property, which is estimated to be the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows are based on existing reserves, forecasted production and cost information and management's outlook of future commodity prices. Where probable and possible reserves exist, an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves is included in the impairment evaluation. The underlying commodity prices used in the determination of our estimated future net cash flows are based on NYMEX forward strip prices at the end of the period, adjusted by field or area for estimated location and quality differentials, as well as other trends and factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Future operating costs estimates, including appropriate escalators, are also developed based on a review of actual costs by field or area. Downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment.\nEstimates of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves\nOur estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimate. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance and material balance methods. Certain new producing properties with little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to offset production, both of which provide accurate forecasts. Non-producing reserve estimates for both developed and undeveloped properties were forecast using either volumetric and/or analogy methods. These methods provide accurate forecasts due to the mature nature of the properties targeted for development and an abundance of subsurface control data.\n 59 \nThe accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workover costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Independent reserve engineers prepare our reserve estimates at the end of each year.\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize the costs of our oil and natural gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Our reserves are also the basis of our supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures.\nAccounting for Derivatives\nWe use derivatives to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated production for the next 12 - 36 months. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivatives. Accordingly, we carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet, with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the change occurs. Our current results of operations would potentially have been significantly different had we elected and qualified for hedge accounting on our derivatives.\nIn determining the amounts to be recorded, we are required to estimate the fair values of the derivatives. We base our estimates of fair value upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, volatility, the time value of options, our credit worthiness and the credit worthiness of the counterparties to our derivative instruments. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts and interest rates.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. In accounting for a business combination, the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based upon the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired net of the liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level.\nWe have the option of performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine if impairment may have occurred. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would be required to perform the two step impairment test.\nUnder the first step in the impairment test, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed. Under the second step in the impairment test, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by subtracting the estimated fair values of our reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of our reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on the quoted market price for our common units adjusted for a control premium, which is the premium over current market price a market participant may be willing to pay to obtain the synergies and other benefits that control would provide. Under the income approach, the fair value was based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value include estimates of the appropriate control premium, future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. Given the nature of these estimates and their application to specific assets and liabilities and time frames, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions.\n 60 \nAccounting for Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. Our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with site reclamation, dismantling facilities and plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.\nWe record an asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) and capitalize the asset retirement cost in oil and natural gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred based upon the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells. After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using an assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis.\nInherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions of these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance.\nRevenue Recognition\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at fixed or determinable prices, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and collectibility of the revenue is reasonably assured. Virtually all of our contracts' pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that prices fluctuate to remain competitive with other available suppliers.\nThere are two principal accounting practices to account for natural gas imbalances. These methods differ as to whether revenue is recognized based on the actual sale of natural gas (sales method) or an owner's entitled share of the current period's production (entitlement method). We follow the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenues. Under this method of accounting, revenues are recognized based on volumes sold, which may differ from the volume to which we are entitled based on our working interest. An imbalance is recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under-produced owner(s) to recoup its entitled share through future production. Under the sales method, no receivables are recorded where we have taken less than our share of production.\nWe own and operate a network of natural gas gathering systems in the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana which gather and transport owned natural gas and a small amount of third party natural gas to intrastate, interstate and local distribution pipelines. Natural gas gathering and transportation revenue is recognized when the natural gas has been delivered to a custody transfer point.\n 61 \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet loss for 2016 was $242.9 million compared with net income of $21.3 million for 2015. The significant factors in this change were (i) a $255.5 million decrease in income from discontinued operations; (ii) a $114.1 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives; partially offset by (iii) a $65.9 million decrease in impairment of goodwill; and (iv) a $23.7 million increase in gain on early extinguishment of debt.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for 2016 totaled $182.7 million, an increase of $7.6 million compared with 2015. This was the result of increases of $18.5 million related to increased oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production as a result of the October 2015 acquisitions offset by decreases of $10.9 million related to lower prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\nLease operating expenses for 2016 increased $3.7 million compared with 2015 as the result of $9.9 million from increased oil and natural gas production offset by $6.2 million from a lower cost per Mcfe. The lower unit cost per Mcfe reflects the downward trend in operating costs throughout the oil and natural gas industry. Lease operating expenses per Mcfe were $1.46 in 2016 compared with $1.56 in 2015.\nDry hole and exploration costs for 2016 decreased $3.0 million compared with 2015 as a result of our decreased drilling program during 2016.\nProduction taxes for 2016 increased $0.6 million compared with 2015 due to higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. Production taxes for 2016 were $0.10 per Mcfe compared with $0.11 per Mcfe for 2015.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) for 2016 increased $13.2 million compared with 2015 due to $11.5 million of increased oil and natural gas production combined with $1.7 million from a higher average DD&A rate per Mcfe. The higher average DD&A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates. DD&A for 2016 was $1.69 per Mcfe compared with $1.66 per Mcfe for 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2016 totaled $33.6 million, a decrease of $5.4 million compared with 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) $5.4 million of lower equity compensation costs, of which $2.3 million related to the accelerated vesting of the phantom units of a former officer in 2015; (ii) $1.3 million of decreased compensation costs, of which $0.8 million related to the vesting of our phantom units under our equity compensation plan; partially offset by (iii) $1.7 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement related to our October 2015 acquisition. General and administrative expenses were $0.48 per Mcfe in 2016 compared with $0.62 per Mcfe in 2015.\n 62 \nAs a result of a reduction in estimated future net cash flows primarily caused by the decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the disposition of oil and gas properties, we incurred impairment charges of $131.3 million and $136.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, $89.5 million and $86.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to oil and natural gas properties that were written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. The $89.5 million of impairment for 2016 related to oil and natural gas properties in the Barnett Shale which were sold during December 2016 (see Note 5). Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2016 consisted of $41.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $35.8 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Appalachian Basin, primarily in the Utica Shale. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2015 consisted of $49.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $49.2 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Utica Shale.\nIn conjunction with our October 2015 acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, we recorded $65.9 million of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to the continued decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. We then determined the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the estimated fair values of the reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. As the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognized a $65.9 million impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn 2015, we recognized a gain of $0.6 million on the sale of certain non-core oil and natural gas properties.\nLoss on derivatives, net was $36.0 million for 2016 compared with a gain on derivatives, net of $78.1 million for 2015. This change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2016 for oil averaged $56.19 per Bbl compared with $40.45 at December 31, 2015, and the 12 month forward prices at December 31, 2016 for natural gas averaged $3.61 per MmBtu compared with $2.49 at December 31, 2015. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for oil averaged $40.45 per Bbl compared with $56.46 per Bbl at December 31, 2014, and the 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for natural gas averaged $2.49 per MmBtu compared with $3.03 at December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense for 2016 decreased $7.8 million compared with 2015 due to $9.4 million from a lower weighted average long-term debt balance, partially offset by $0.1 million from a higher weighted average effective interest rate and the write-off of $1.5 million of loan costs due to the reduction in the borrowing base and the redemption of the senior notes due April 2019.\nIn 2016, we recognized a $47.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $82.7 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million. In 2015, we recognized a $24.0 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $74.0 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million.\nIn 2016, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of tax benefits as a result of tax refunds and lower taxes. In December 2015, we converted our wholly-owned subsidiary Belden and Blake Corporation ( Belden\u201d) from a corporation into a single member limited liability company. As a result, the $13.4 million of deferred taxes recorded in the acquisition of Belden were realized. The benefit was offset by an $11.7 million current tax liability for the estimated federal and state taxes based on the fair value of Belden as of the date of conversion.\nIncome from discontinued operations was $255.5 million in 2015. Included in 2015 was the $246.7 million gain on the sale of UEO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet income for 2015 was $21.3 million compared with $129.7 million for 2014. The significant factors in this change were (i) a $159.6 million decrease in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues; (ii) a $32.8 million decrease in gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties; (iii) a $65.9 million impairment of goodwill; (iv) a $22.7 million increase in impairment of oil and natural gas properties; and (v) a $21.6 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives; offset by (v) a $148.0 million increase in income (loss) from discontinued operations; (vi) a $24.0 million gain on early extinguishment of debt and (vii) a $21.2 million decrease in operating costs and expenses (excluding impairment of oil and natural gas properties and impairment of goodwill).\n 63 \nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for 2015 totaled $175.1 million, a decrease of $159.6 million compared with 2014. This was the result of decreases of $159.8 million related to lower prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and $0.5 million from decreased oil production from our reduced capital spending program and natural decline offset by $0.7 million related to increased oil and natural gas production as a result of the October 2015 acquisitions.\nLease operating expenses for 2015 decreased $6.2 million compared with 2014 as the result of $6.6 million from a lower cost per Mcfe offset by $0.4 million from increased oil and natural gas production. The lower unit cost per Mcfe reflects the downward trend in operating costs throughout the oil and natural gas industry. Lease operating expenses per Mcfe were $1.56 in 2015 compared with $1.66 in 2014.\nDry hole and exploration costs for 2015 decreased $3.0 million compared with 2014 as a result of lower costs at certain of our oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin and the Austin Chalk.\nProduction taxes for 2015 decreased $5.2 million compared with 2014 due to lower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. Production taxes for 2015 were $0.11 per Mcfe compared with $0.19 per Mcfe for 2014.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) for 2015 decreased $0.1 million compared with 2014 due to $0.5 million from a lower average DD&A rate per Mcfe offset by $0.4 million of increased oil and natural gas production. The lower average DD&A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates and the decrease in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties from the impact of the impairments that were recognized in 2014. DD&A for 2015 was $1.66 per Mcfe compared with $1.67 per Mcfe for 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2015 totaled $39.0 million, a decrease of $6.0 million compared with 2014. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) $7.3 million of lower equity compensation costs; (ii) $1.0 million of costs incurred in 2014 related to the departure of a former officer; and (iii) $0.9 million of decreased compensation costs related to the vesting of our phantom units issued under our equity based compensation plan; offset by (iv) $2.1 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement, (v) $0.8 million of increased audit and reserve fees as a result of our October 2015 acquisitions; and (vi) $0.9 million of due diligence costs related to our October 2015 acquisitions. General and administrative expenses were $0.62 per Mcfe in 2015 compared with $0.71 per Mcfe in 2014.\nAs a result of a reduction in estimated future net cash flows primarily caused by the decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we incurred impairment charges of $136.7 million and $114.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts, $86.9 million and $103.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to oil and natural gas properties that were written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2015 consisted of $49.8 million of leasehold impairments, of which $49.2 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Utica Shale. The remainder of the impairment charges in 2014 consisted of $10.7 million of leasehold impairment charges and $0.2 million of an impairment charge to write down assets held for sale to their fair value.\nIn conjunction with our October 2015 acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, we recorded $65.9 million of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to the continued decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of the fair value included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. We then determined the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the estimated fair values of the reporting unit's assets net of liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit. As the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognized a $65.9 million impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nIn 2015, we recognized a gain of $0.6 million on the sale of certain non-core oil and natural gas properties. In 2014, we recognized a $31.8 million gain on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in the Eagle Ford and a $1.5 million gain on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in the Utica Shale area of Ohio.\n 64 \nGain on derivatives, net was $78.1 million for 2015 compared with $99.7 million for 2014. This change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2015 for oil averaged $40.45 per Bbl compared with $56.46 at December 31, 2014, and the 12 month forward prices at December 31, 2015 for natural gas averaged $2.49 per MmBtu compared with $3.03 at December 31, 2014. The 12 month forward price at December 31, 2014 for oil averaged $56.46 per Bbl compared with $95.66 per Bbl at December 31, 2013, and the 12 month forward price at December 31, 2014 for natural gas averaged $3.03 per MmBtu compared with $4.19 at December 31, 2013.\nInterest expense for 2015 decreased $2.2 million compared with 2014 due to $10.6 million from a higher weighted effective average interest rate and $5.7 million from a decrease in capitalized interest offset by $18.5 million from a lower weighted average long-term debt balance.\nIn 2015, we recognized a $24.0 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $74.0 million of our Notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million.\nIn December 2015, we converted Belden from a corporation into a single member limited liability company. As a result, the $13.4 million of deferred taxes recorded in the acquisition of Belden were realized. The benefit was offset by an $11.7 million current tax liability for the estimated federal and state taxes based on the fair value of Belden as of the date of conversion.\nIncome from discontinued operations was $255.5 million for 2015 compared with $107.5 million in 2014. Included in 2015 and 2014 were the $246.7 million gain on the sale of UEO and the $92.1 million gain of the sale of Cardinal, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity and capital have been issuances of equity and debt securities, borrowings under our credit facility and cash flows from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, development of our oil and natural gas properties, distributions to our unitholders and general partner and working capital needs.\nIn 2016, in response to continued lower prices, we took a number of actions, including repurchasing outstanding senior notes, reducing capital spending and operating costs, suspending distributions on our common units and strategic divestitures of non-core assets, to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. As a result of these steps, as of December 31, 2016, we have over $205 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity, cash on hand and restricted cash. However, given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices beginning in 2017 relative to previous years, we have taken additional steps going forward into 2017 to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include:\n \u00b7 focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating costs; \n \u00b7 increasing our capital spending budget to $30 - $45 million from $10.7 million in 2016, in an effort to maintain current production levels; \n \u00b7 maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment, which includes continuing to assess the appropriate distribution levels every quarter; \n \u00b7 continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties such as our Eagle Ford Acquisition in January 2017; and \n \u00b7 further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of acreage. \nFor 2017, we believe that cash on hand, proceeds from sales of assets, net cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our capital budget and satisfy our short-term liquidity needs.\nWe may also utilize borrowings under our credit facility and various financing sources available to us, including the issuance of equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements, to fund our acquisitions and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to complete future offerings of equity or debt securities and the timing of these offerings will depend upon various factors including prevailing market conditions and our financial condition.\n 65 \nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have a $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in February 2020. Borrowings under the facility may not exceed a borrowing base\u201d determined by the lenders based on our oil and natural gas reserves. As of December 31, 2016, the borrowing base was $450.0 million, and we had $265.0 million outstanding. We believe we will maintain sufficient short-term liquidity. However, should prices decline significantly from current levels, the borrowing base could be reduced again in future redeterminations, which would impact our short-term liquidity.\nIn April 2016, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that eased leverage covenants and added an interest coverage ratio. Specifically, the amendment:\n \u00b7 decreased the borrowing base to $450.0 million; \n \u00b7 changed the senior secured funded debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no greater than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, 3.0 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, 3.5 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, 4.0 to 1.0; \n \u00b7 changed the total funded debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no greater than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2018, 5.50 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018, 5.25 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018 and thereafter, 4.25 to 1.0; \n \u00b7 added an EBITDAX to cash interest expense ratio covenant to be no less than (a) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, 2.5 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, 2.0 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and thereafter, 1.5 to 1.0; \n \u00b7 allowed for up to $35.0 million of cash, reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any quarterly distributions for the remainder of 2016, to be used for the redemption of our senior notes due April 2019; and \n \u00b7 limited cash held by us to the greater of 5% of the current borrowing base or $30.0 million. \nAs of December 31, 2016, we have $343.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of 8.0% senior notes due April 2019. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate carrying amount of the senior notes due April 2019 was $341.9 million.\nFor additional information about our long-term debt, such as interest rates and covenants, please see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d contained herein.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $5.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, which included $0.7 million of short-term investments. With regard to our short-term investments, we invest in money market accounts with major financial institutions.\nRestricted Cash\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $52.1 million of restricted cash, which represents proceeds from the Barnett Shale divestiture we deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. In January 2017, these proceeds were used to fund, in part, the Eagle Ford Acquisition.\n 66 \nCounterparty Exposure\nAll of our derivative contracts are with major financial institutions who are also lenders under our credit facility. Should one of these financial counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our derivative contracts and we could incur a loss. As of December 31, 2016, all of our counterparties have performed pursuant to their derivative contracts.\nCash Flows\n\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities provided $33.9 million and $141.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The significant factors in the change were $85.8 million of decreased cash settlements from our matured derivative contracts, an $11.7 million federal tax payment related to the conversion of an acquired corporation to a single member LLC and a $28.9 million change in working capital, primarily related to higher accounts receivable as a result of higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production during 2016.\nCash flows from operating activities provided $141.3 million and $148.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The significant factors in the change were a $161.1 million decrease in our revenues offset by $135.3 million of increased cash settlements from our matured derivative contracts and the effects of our efforts to increase our financial flexibility through asset sales and accretive acquisitions.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2016, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $9.8 million. This consisted of $52.1 million of restricted cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code and $15.3 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties offset by $54.5 million from the sale of oil and natural gas properties and $3.0 million in cash settlements from acquired derivative contracts.\nDuring 2015, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $280.4 million. This consisted of $250.4 million for acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, $67.9 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties offset by $33.8 million from the release of cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, $2.6 million in cash settlements from acquired derivative contracts and $1.5 million in proceeds from the sales of oil and natural gas properties. Net cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $572.2 million consisted of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in UEO.\nDuring 2014, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $93.8 million, consisting of $102.8 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties and an increase of $33.8 million related to cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code offset by $45.2 million in proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties. Net cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $47.0 million consisted of $161.1 million in proceeds from the sale of our interest in Cardinal offset by $114.1 million of additions to our investment in UEO.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2016, we received $57.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, repaid $57.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility, and paid distributions of $3.9 million to holders of our common units, phantom units and our general partner. We also redeemed $82.7 million of our senior notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million.\nDuring 2015, we repaid $561.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility with proceeds from the sale of our investment in UEO and the release of our restricted cash. We also redeemed $74.0 million of our senior notes due April 2019 for $50.0 million, received $295.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, incurred loan costs of $4.1 million related to the amendments of our credit facility and paid distributions of $101.0 million to holders of our common units, phantom units and our general partner.\n 67 \nDuring 2014, we received $209.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, and we repaid $159.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility. In addition, we paid distributions of $155.0 million to holders of our common units and phantom units and our general partner.\nCapital Requirements\nWe currently expect spending in 2017 for additions to our oil and natural gas properties to be between $30 million and $45 million, an increase from the amounts spent in 2016. In addition, we spent $58.7 million (before post-closing purchase price adjustments) for the Eagle Ford Shale properties we acquired on January 31, 2017.\nWe expect to fund these amounts with cash on hand, restricted cash, proceeds from sales of assets, net cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe are actively engaged in the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. We would expect to finance any significant acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in 2017 through the issuance of equity or debt securities.\nContractual Obligations\n\n (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest based on (i) the amount outstanding under our credit facility as of December 31, 2016 and the weighted average interest rate for 2016 of 3.75%, and (ii) our $343.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due April 2019. Such amounts do not include the effects of our interest rate swaps. \n (2) Amounts represent commitments under a firm transportation agreement at current rates. \n (3) Amounts represent payments to be made under our omnibus agreement with EnerVest based on the amount that we will pay in 2017. This amount will increase or decrease as we purchase or divest assets. While these payments will continue for periods subsequent to December 31, 2017, no amounts are shown as they cannot be quantified. \nOur asset retirement obligations are not included in the table above given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. The total amount of our asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2016 is $183.5 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements that give rise to off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2016, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements which totaled $0.3 million.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nPlease see Item 8. Financial Statements and supplementary Data\u201d contained herein for additional information.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act (each a forward-looking statement\u201d). These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the following:\n 68 \n \u00b7 our future financial and operating performance and results, and our ability to resume and sustain distributions; \n \u00b7 our business strategy and plans, and future capital expenditures, including plans to optimize the value of our assets; \n \u00b7 our estimated net proved reserves, PV-10 value and standardized measure; \n \u00b7 market prices; \n \u00b7 our future derivative activities; and \n \u00b7 our plans and forecasts. \nWe have based these forward-looking statements on our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events.\nThe words anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d ensure,\u201d expect,\u201d if,\u201d intend,\u201d estimate,\u201d project,\u201d forecasts,\u201d predict,\u201d outlook,\u201d aim,\u201d will,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d would,\u201d may,\u201d likely\u201d and similar expressions, and the negative thereof, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking\u201d information. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. These statements also involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or financial condition to materially differ from our expectations in this Form 10-K including, but not limited to:\n \u00b7 fluctuations in prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the length of time commodity prices remain depressed; \n \u00b7 significant disruptions in the financial markets; \n \u00b7 future capital requirements and availability of financing; \n \u00b7 uncertainty inherent in estimating our reserves; \n \u00b7 risks associated with drilling and operating wells; \n \u00b7 discovery, acquisition, development and replacement of reserves; \n \u00b7 cash flows and liquidity; \n \u00b7 timing and amount of future production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; \n \u00b7 availability of drilling and production equipment; \n \u00b7 marketing of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; \n \u00b7 developments in oil and natural gas producing countries; \n \u00b7 competition; \n \u00b7 general economic conditions; \n \u00b7 governmental regulations; \n \u00b7 activities taken or non-performance by third parties, including suppliers, contractors, operators, transporters and purchasers of our production and counterparties to our derivative financial instrument contracts; \n \u00b7 hedging decisions, including whether or not to enter into derivative financial instruments; \n 69 \n \u00b7 actions of third party co-owners of interest in properties in which we also own an interest; \n \u00b7 fluctuations in interest rates and the value of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets; and \n \u00b7 our ability to effectively integrate companies and properties that we acquire. \nAll of our forward-looking information is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expected. Although it is not possible to identify all factors, these risks and uncertainties include the risk factors and the timing of any of those risk factors identified in the Risk Factors\u201d section included in Item 1A.\nOur revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Declines in prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower prices also may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids that we can produce economically. A decline in prices could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value and estimated quantities of our reserves, our ability to fund our operations and our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and access to capital. Historically, prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.", "item_7_tables": "Table 292: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (MBbls) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,052 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas liquids (MBbls) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas (MMcf) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,363 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net production (MMcfe) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,540 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average sales price per unit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Oil (Bbl) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas liquids (Bbl) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas (Mcf) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mcfe </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average unit cost per Mcfe: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Production taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 309: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,766 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,814 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,967 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(420,916 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(104,829 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 311: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period (amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 -

Its assets as of December 31, 2016 included estimated net proved reserves of 12.6 MMBbls of oil, 575.3 Bcf of gas, and 33.4 MMBbls of natural gas liquids.\n\nCurrent Price Environment \n- Low oil, gas, and NGL prices in 2016 negatively impacted revenues, earnings, and cash flows. Prices remain volatile, which creates uncertainty and could further reduce revenues if they decline.\n\nResponse to Price Environment\n- To preserve liquidity, EV took several actions in 2016-2017 including: reduced capital spending, suspended distributions, assessed strategic divestitures, evaluated acquisitions, amended credit facility, repurchased senior notes at a discount.\n\nFinancial Performance  \n- Had a net loss of $242.9 million in 2016 compared to net income of $21.3 million in 2015, primarily due to lower income from discontinued operations, derivatives, impairments, etc.\n- Operating cash flows were $33.9 million in 2016, down from $141.3 million in 2015.\n\nOutlook\n- EV expects to spend $30-45 million on capital projects in 2017 to maintain production levels. It continues to focus on managing costs, acquisitions, and monetizing acreage to preserve liquidity in the low commodity price environment.\n\nLiquidity\n- Has over $205 million in liquidity from borrowing capacity, cash on hand, and restricted cash. But leverage covenants could become an issue in 2018 if prices stay low.\n\nSo in summary, EV took actions to cut costs and capital and preserve liquidity after low commodity prices caused financial challenges, but its outlook remains uncertain due to volatile market conditions."}
