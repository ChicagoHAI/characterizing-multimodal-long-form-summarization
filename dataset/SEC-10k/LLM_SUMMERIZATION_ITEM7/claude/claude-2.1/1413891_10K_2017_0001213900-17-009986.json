You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may\u201d will,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate\u201d and continue,\u201d or similar words. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.\nReaders are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Important factors known to us could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time. We believe that its assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business and operations of the Company. No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions. Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for the Company's services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.\nBusiness Overview\nTelecommunications\nTelecommunications providers and enterprise customers continue to seek and outsource solutions in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment, provide flexibility in workforce sizing and expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring. As a result, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand both our United States and international telecommunications solutions services and staffing services capabilities. As we continue to expand our presence in the marketplace, we will target those customers going through new network deployments and wireless service upgrades.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to increase our gross margins by leveraging our single-source end-to-end network to efficiently provide a full spectrum of end-to- end next-generation network solutions and staffing services to our customers. We believe our solutions and services offerings can alleviate some of the inefficiencies typically present in our industry, which result, in part, from the highly-fragmented nature of the telecommunications industry, limited access to skilled labor and the difficulty industry participants have in managing multiple specialty-service providers to address their needs. As a result, we believe we can provide superior service to our customers and eliminate certain redundancies and costs for them. We believe our ability to address a wide range of end-to-end solutions, network infrastructure and project-staffing service needs of our telecommunications industry clients is a key competitive advantage. Our ability to offer diverse technical capabilities (including design, engineering, construction, deployment, and installation and integration services) allows customers to turn to a single source for those specific specialty services, as well as to entrust us with the execution of entire turn-key solutions.\nWe have become a multi-faceted company with an international presence. We believe this platform will allow us to leverage our corporate and other fixed costs and capture gross margin benefits. Our platform is highly scalable. We typically hire workers to staff projects on a project-by-project basis and our other operating expenses are primarily fixed. Accordingly, we are generally able to deploy personnel to infrastructure projects in the United States and beyond without incremental increases in operating costs, allowing us to achieve greater margins. We believe this business model enables us to staff our business efficiently to meet changes in demand.\nFinally, given the worldwide popularity of telecommunications and wireless products and services, we will selectively pursue international expansion, which we believe represents a compelling opportunity for additional long-term growth.\nOur planned expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our operations management systems, financial and management controls and information systems and to hire, train and retain skilled telecommunications personnel. The timing and amount of investments in our expansion could affect the comparability of our results of operations in future periods.\nOur planned acquisitions will be timed with additions to our management team of skilled professionals with deep industry knowledge and a strong track record of execution. Our senior management team brings an average of over 30 years of individual experience across a broad range of disciplines. We believe our senior management team is a key driver of our success and is well-positioned to execute our strategy.\nWe were incorporated 2007, but functioned as a development stage company with limited activities through 2017. In April, 2017 we acquired AW Solutions.\nEnergy Alternatives\nWe have developed processes for the electro-reduction of carbon dioxide ( ERC\u201d). During the year, our patents on the ERC technology lapsed. During the year, our exclusive license agreement for a mixed-reactant fuel cell ( MRFC\u201d) expired due to non-payment of license fees by us. These events significantly impair our ability to carry on this line of business. Unless we renew the patents and reach a new agreement to licenses the MRFC technology, it will likely be necessary to discontinue this line of business.\nIn the past, we have contracted out our development work to various laboratories and carried out research and development on our ERC and MRFC technologies in our own internal laboratory with our own staff in Vancouver, BC. These activities include: experimentation to improve the process performance; process and economic modeling to optimize the costs of a commercial system; design and simulation of pilot systems for technology demonstration and validation; business development activities such as the establishment of strategic and technology development partners; and the design and fabrication of laboratory prototypes, among others.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nChanges in Demand for Data Capacity and Reliability.\nThe telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to advances in technology, increased competition as telephone and cable companies converge, the growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services and increased governmental broadband stimulus funding. As a result of these factors, the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability. Telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment, provide flexibility in workforce sizing, expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success. These factors drive customer demand for our services.\nThe proliferation of smart phones and other wireless data devices has driven demand for mobile broadband. This demand and other advances in technology have prompted wireless carriers to upgrade their networks. Wireless carriers are actively increasing spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic, upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency and consolidate disparate technology platforms. These customer initiatives present long-term opportunities for us for the wireless services we provide. Further, the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of cellular traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber and coaxial networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites. These trends are increasing the demand for the types of services we provide.\nOur Ability to Recruit, Manage and Retain High-Quality IT and Telecommunications Personnel.\nThe shortage of skilled labor in the telecommunications industry and the difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled personnel can frequently limit the ability of specialty contractors to bid for and complete certain contracts. We believe our access to a skilled labor pool gives us a competitive edge over our competitors as we continue to expand.\nOur Ability to Integrate Our Acquired Business and Expand Internationally\nWe have completed one material acquisition April 25, 2017 and plan to consummate additional acquisitions in the near term. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses into our telecommunications platform. In addition, we believe international expansion represents a compelling opportunity for additional growth over the long-term because of the worldwide need for telecommunications infrastructure. We plan to expand our global presence either by expanding our current operations or by acquiring subsidiaries with international platforms.\nOur Ability to Expand and Diversify Our Customer Base.\nOur customers for specialty contracting services consist of leading telephone, wireless, cable television, utility and other companies. Historically, our revenue has been significantly concentrated in a small number of customers. Although we still operate at a net loss, our revenue this years has increased as we have acquired additional subsidiaries and diversified our customer base and revenue streams. The percentage of our revenue attributable to our top 10 customers, as well as our only customer that contributed at least 10% of our revenue in at least one of the years specified in the following table, were as follows:\nImpact of Recently-Completed Acquisitions\t\nWe have grown significantly and expanded our service offerings and geographic reach through a strategic acquisition on April 25, 2017. We have completed one (1) material acquisition of AW Solutions and initiated the new Telecommunication Division. We expect to regularly review opportunities, and periodically to engage in discussions, regarding possible additional acquisitions. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify, acquire and successfully integrate companies.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpiration and cancelation of patents and licenses for ERC and MRFC technologies\nThe ERC and MRFC technologies relate to projects involving research and development of alternative energy methods and uses. The expiration of our patents and of our exclusive license agreement will significantly impair our ability to carry on this line of business. Unless we renew the patents and reach a new agreement to licenses the MRFC technology, it will likely be necessary to discontinue this line of business. As a result, we intend to focus on our telecommunications line of business in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our historical consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those related to recognition of revenue for costs, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, income taxes, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation expense, contingent consideration and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. These estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements. The impact of these policies affects our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nOther significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also important to understanding our historical consolidated financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report contain additional information related to our accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies described herein, and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nOur consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by management.\nBasis of Presentation/Principles of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, Carbon Commodity Corporation, Climate ESCO Ltd., Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., Mantra China Inc., Mantra China Limited, Mantra Media Corp., Mantra NextGen Power Inc., Mantra Wind Inc., AW Solutions, Inc.(from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017), Tropical Communications, Inc. (from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017) and AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC.(from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017). All the subsidiaries are wholly-owned with the exception of Climate ESCO Ltd., which is 64.55% owned, Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., which is 88.21% owned and AW Solutions, Inc., Tropical Communications, Inc., and AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC which are all 80.1% owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, equity component of convertible debt, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company records unbilled receivables for services performed but not billed. At May 31, 2017, unbilled receivables totaled $430,669, and are included in accounts receivable. Management reviews a customer's credit history before extending credit. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. Estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed each period, and changes are recorded in the period in which they become known. Management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable each period. This review considers the aging of account balances, historical bad debt experience, changes in customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, customer payment activity and other relevant factors. Should any of these factors change, the estimate made by management may also change. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $267,476 at May 31, 2017.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Automotive </td> <td>3-5 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Computer equipment and software </td> <td>3-7 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Leasehold improvements </td> <td>5 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Office equipment and furniture </td> <td>5 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Research equipment </td> <td>5 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill\nGoodwill was generated through the acquisition of AW Solutions in fiscal 2017 as the total consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nThe Company tests its goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in the Company's expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and the Company's consolidated financial results.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company tests goodwill by estimating fair value using a Discounted Cash Flow ( DCF\u201d) model. The key assumptions used in the DCF model to determine the highest and best use of estimated future cash flows include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value and an estimate of a market participant's weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows to their present value. There were no impairment charges during the year ended May 31, 2017.\nIntangible Assets\nAt May 31, 2017, definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, tradenames and customer relationships which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1-10 years. At May 31, 2016, definite-lived intangible assets consisted of patents and were stated at cost. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. During the year ended May 31, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment loss related patents held of $59,060.\nThe Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. The Company has no intangibles with indefinite lives.\nFor long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. The Company measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.\nLong-lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.\nForeign Currency Translation\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the currency of measurement at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in income.\nThe Company's integrated foreign subsidiaries are financially or operationally dependent on the Company. The Company uses the temporal method to translate the accounts of its integrated operations into U.S. dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period, except for amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related asset. The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognized in income.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company conducts business, and files federal and state income, franchise or net worth, tax returns in Canada, the United States, in various states within the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Company determines its filing obligations in a jurisdiction in accordance with existing statutory and case law. The Company may be subject to a reassessment of federal and provincial income taxes by Canadian tax authorities for a period of three years from the date of the original notice of assessment in respect of any particular taxation year. For Canadian and U.S. income tax returns, the open taxation years range from 2010 to 2017. In certain circumstances, the U.S. federal statute of limitations can reach beyond the standard three year period. U.S. state statutes of limitations for income tax assessment vary from state to state. Tax authorities of Canada and U.S. have not audited any of the Company's, or its subsidiaries', income tax returns for the open taxation years noted above.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, and in particular, any valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability. The Company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, which should reduce taxable income in future periods. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income.\nThe Company follows the guidance set forth within ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC Topic 740\u201d) which prescribes a two-step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, recognition and classification of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Penalties and interest, if incurred, would be recorded as a component of current income tax expense.\nThe Company received a tax notice from the Puerto Rican government requesting payment of taxes related to 2014 in the amount of $166,084 plus penalties and interest of $87,027 for a total obligation due of $253,111. This tax assessment is included in accrued expenses at May 31, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are generated from applications and infrastructure services. The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10, Revenue Recognition\u201d. The Company recognizes revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\nThe applications and infrastructure revenues are derived from contracts to provide technical engineering services along with contracting services to commercial and governmental customers. The Company's service contracts generally require specific tasks or services that the Company must perform under the contract. The Company recognizes revenues associated with these services upon the completion of the related task or service which is at the time the four revenue recognition criteria have been met. Direct costs incurred related to performance of the task or service are deferred and recorded as prepaid expense and are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.\nThe Company also generates revenue from service contracts with certain customers. These contracts are accounted for under the proportional performance method. Under this method, revenue is recognized in proportion to the value provided to the customer for each project as of each reporting date.\nThe Company records unbilled receivables for revenues earned, but not yet billed.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company performed research and development services. The Company recognized revenue under research contracts when a contract has been executed, the contract price is fixed and determinable, delivery of services or products has occurred, and collectability of the contract price is considered reasonably assured and can be reasonably estimated. Revenue was based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates plus other billable direct costs.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation and amortization), direct materials, insurance claims and other direct costs.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected by the Company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period.\nLoss Per Share\nThe Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, \"Earnings per Share\" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at May 31, 2017, the Company had 647,182,222 (2016 - 56,260,229) dilutive potential shares outstanding.\nComprehensive Loss\nASC 220, Comprehensive Income,\u201d establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As at May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivables. The Company maintains its cash balances with high-credit-quality financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be withdrawn upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company provides credit to customers on an uncollateralized basis after evaluating client creditworthiness. For the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017, two customers accounted for 48% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017. In addition, amounts due from these customers represented 39% and 8%, respectively, of trade accounts receivable as of May 31, 2017.\nThe Company's customers are primarily located within the domestic United States of America and Puerto Rico. Revenues generated within the domestic United States of America accounted for approximately 94% of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017. Revenues generated from customers in Puerto Rico accounted for approximately 6% of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures and discloses the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy prescribed by US generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value hierarchy has three levels, which are based on reliable available inputs of observable data. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The three-level hierarchy is defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and.\nLevel 3 - fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nFinancial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, loans payable and convertible debentures. Derivative liabilities are determined based on Level 3\u201d inputs, which are significant and unobservable and have the lowest priority. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3\u201d during the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.\nOur financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2017 and 2016, consisted of the following:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total fair\nvalue at\nMay 31,\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quoted prices\nin active\nmarkets\n(Level 1)\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Significant\nother\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2)\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Significant\nunobservable\ninputs\n(Level 3)\n$ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Description: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Derivative liability (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,760,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,760,067 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total fair\nvalue at\nMay 31,\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quoted prices\nin active\nmarkets\n(Level 1)\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Significant\nother\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2)\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Significant\nunobservable\ninputs\n(Level 3)\n$ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Description: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Derivative liability (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>The Company has estimated the fair value of these derivatives using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, Monte-Carlo model or a Binomial Model based. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial statement. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. See Note 10 for additional information.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging\u201d and all derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. The Company uses estimates of fair value to value its derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able market participants. In general, the Company's policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads, relying first on observable data from active markets. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair values and may not be realizable. The Company categorizes its fair value estimates in accordance with ASC 820 based on the hierarchical framework associated with the three levels of price transparency utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value as discussed above. As at May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had a $3,760,067 and $978,245 derivative liability, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods, as amended, beginning after December 15, 2018. The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is effective for the Company on June 1, 2019, and early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company continues to evaluate the standard and has not yet selected a transition method.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The Company has elected to early adopt the requirements of ASU 2015-17 and the results of such adoption are presented within these consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company continues to evaluate the effects of ASU 2016-02 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations ( ASU 2016-08\u201d). The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606: The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-10 clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606: The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-12 provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients. Specifically, the amendments in this update (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion in step 1, and provides additional clarification for when to recognize revenue for a contract that fails step 1, (2) permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception, and clarifies that the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration, (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (5) clarifies that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application. Further, accounting for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy GAAP are irrelevant to the assessment of whether a contract is complete. In addition, the amendments permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts or only to contracts that are not completed contracts, and (6) clarifies that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. However, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-12 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). The Amendments in this Update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-01 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d). This standard will simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Current guidance requires that companies compute the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 by performing procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. This standard will require companies to perform annual or interim goodwill impairment tests by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period, and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption of this standard is permitted on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or result of operations.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal year Ended May 31, 2017 Compared to Fiscal year Ended May 31, 2016\nThe following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOur operating results for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Statement of Operations Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(as revised) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,069,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,011,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>922,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,761,829 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(852,564 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total other expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,109,458 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,367,296 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,871,287 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,219,860 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss per share, basic </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.06 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.03 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss per share, diluted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.06 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.03 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Basic weighted average shares outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,085,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,327,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Diluted weighted average shares outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance sheet data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>345,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts receivable, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,623,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total current assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,100,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill and intangible assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,964,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,615 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,188,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>171,027 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total current liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,966,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,845,939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,308 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stockholders' (deficit) equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,777,296 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,678,220 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased from $70,298 for the year ended May 31, 2016 to $1,069,917 for the year ended May 31, 2017. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders increased from $2,219,860 for the year ended May 31, 2016 to $6,871,287 for the year ended May 31, 2017. As of May 31, 2016, our stockholders' deficit was $4,777,296. During 2017, all of our revenue and a significant portion of our expense was generated by our acquired company AW Solutions. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company generated a nominal amount of revenue from the provision of research and development services.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years. We are currently party to numerous master service agreements, and typically have multiple agreements with each of our customers. Master Service Agreements (MSA's) generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discreet pricing for individual tasks. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer's own employees and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In most cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice. The remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects. Long-term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date. Short-term contracts for specific projects are generally of three to four months in duration.\nThe percentage of revenue from long-term contracts varies between periods depending on the mix of work performed under our contracts. All revenues derived from master service agreements are from customers that are serviced by our applications and infrastructure and professional services segments. The decline in revenues from multi-year master service agreements is due to the addition of our cloud services segment and managed services segment, which do not derive revenues from multi-year master service agreements.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue from: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Infrastructure & Professional Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,069,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nil </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy Services & Solutions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nil </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>As a percentage of total revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Infrastructure & Professional Services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy Services & Solutions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation and amortization), direct materials, insurance claims and other direct costs.\nFor a majority of the contract services we perform, our customers provide all required materials while we provide the necessary personnel, tools and equipment. Materials supplied by our customers, for which the customer retains financial and performance risk, are not included in our revenue or costs of revenues. We expect cost of revenues to continue to increase if we succeed in continuing to grow our revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs.\nGeneral and administrative costs include all of our corporate costs, as well as costs of our subsidiaries' management personnel and administrative overhead. These costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses, including legal, consulting and professional fees, information technology and development costs, provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense and other costs that are not directly related to performance of our services under customer contracts. Information technology and development costs included in general and administrative expenses are primarily incurred to support and to enhance our operating efficiency. We expect these expenses to continue to generally increase as we expand our operations, but expect that such expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease if we succeed in increasing revenues.\nGeneral and administrative costs were $106,114 for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to $559,316 for the year ended May 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was because of cost cutting resulting in less staff and overhead prior to the acquisition of AW Solutions.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries & Wages Expenses.\nSalaries and wages were $4,845,260 for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to $335,638 for the year ended May 31, 2016. The increase during the year ended May 31, 2017, was primarily the result of issuing 124,251,510 shares with a fair value of $3,976,048 to two new directors of the Company in exchange for services provided.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe had accounts receivable at May 31, 2017 and 2016 of $1,623,200 and $7,358, respectively. At May 31, 2016, the Company's receivables consisted solely of input tax credits receivable. At May 31, 2017, almost all of the Company's receivables were trade accounts receivables related to AW Solutions.\nCapital expenditures\nWe had capital expenditures of $0 and $16,748 for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect our capital expenditures for the 12 months ending May 31, 2018 to increase to some degree with in the integration of AW Solutions. These capital expenditures will be primarily utilized for equipment needed related to fiber operations and office equipment. We expect to fund such capital expenditures out of our working capital.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill was $1,503,633 was for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to nil for the year ended May 31, 2016.\nGoodwill was generated through the acquisitions we have made during 2017. As the total consideration we paid for our completed acquisitions exceeded the value of the net assets acquired, we recorded goodwill for each of our completed acquisitions (see Note 3) of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). At the date of acquisition, we performed a valuation to determine the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, along with the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired. The goodwill is attributable to synergies and economies of scale provided to us by the acquired entity.\nWe perform our annual impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is consistent with our operating segments. Our two (2) reportable segments are infrastructure and professional services, and energy services. Infrastructure and professional services comprised of AW Solutions the energy services operating segment is comprised of Mantra Energy Alternatives (MEA). These reporting units are aggregated to form two (2) operating segments and two (2) reportable segments for financial reporting and for the evaluation of goodwill for impairment. As our business evolves and the acquired entities continue to be integrated, our operating segments may change. This may require us to reassess how goodwill at our reporting units are evaluated for impairment.\nWe perform the impairment testing at least annually or at other times if we believe that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment to the carrying value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill. If it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists, the second step of the goodwill impairment test should be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nWe consider the results of an income approach and a market approach in determining the fair value of the reportable units. We evaluated the forecasted revenue using a discounted cash flow model for each of the reporting units. We also noted no unusual cost factors that would impact operations based on the nature of the working capital requirements of the components comprising the reportable units. Current operating results, including any losses, are evaluated by us in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties. Key assumptions used in the income approach in evaluating goodwill are forecasts for each of the reporting unit revenue growth rates along with forecasted discounted free cash flows for each reporting unit, aggregated into each reporting segment. For the market approach, we used the guideline public company method, under which the fair value of a business is estimated by comparing the subject company to similar companies with publicly-traded ownership interests. From these guideline\u201d companies, valuation multiples are derived and then applied to the appropriate operating statistics of the subject company to arrive at indications of value.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we use available information to prepare estimates and to perform impairment evaluations, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates or related projections, resulting in impairment related to recorded goodwill balances. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. We can provide no assurances that, if such conditions occur, they will not trigger impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods.\nEvents that could cause the risk for impairment to increase are the loss of a major customer or group of customers, the loss of key personnel and changes to current legislation that may impact our industry or its customers' industries.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL's\u201d) of $9,955,092 and $4,047,230, respectively that will be available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These NOL's begin to expire in 2027.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provide for annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss, capital loss and credit carryforwards if the Company were to undergo an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change occurs whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by 5-percent shareholders, as defined in Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such 5-percent shareholders at any time over the preceding three years. In the event such ownership change occurs, the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses capital losses and credits prior to full utilization.\nThe Company has not completed a study to assess whether ownership change has occurred as a result of the Company's acquisition of AWS and related issuance of shares (See Note 3). However, as a result of the issuance of common shares in 2017, the Company believes an ownership change under Sec. 382 may have occurred. As a result of this ownership change certain of the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and credit carryforwards will expire prior to full utilization.\nThe Company performs an analysis each year to determine whether the expected future income will more likely than not be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets. The Company's recent operating results and projections of future income weighed heavily in the Company's overall assessment. Prior to 2017, there were no provisions (or benefits) for income taxes because the Company had sustained cumulative losses since the commencement of operations.\nThe Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and to income taxes in various states in the United States. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. Due to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards all years remain open to examination by the major domestic taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. In addition, all of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are still subject to adjustment.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nAs of May 31, 2017, our total current assets were $2,100,457 and our total current liabilities were $9,966,073, resulting in a working capital deficit of $7,865,616 compared to working capital deficit of $2,832,673 as at May 31, 2016.\nWe have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard we have historically raised additional capital through equity offerings and loan transactions.\nCash Flows\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Used in Operating Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(403,732 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(463,370 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Provided by (Used) In Investing Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,748 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>631,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>473,791 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash (decrease) increase during the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,327 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in cash that we experienced during fiscal 2017 as compared to the decrease of cash during fiscal 2016 was primarily due to acquisition of AW Solutions and increased funding activities during the year, which, added cash to our balance sheet. We obtained $631,103 during the year in funding. This was offset in part by cash used in operating activities $403,732. We expect that our cash position will increase next year, due to operating profits in our telecommunications division. We have not been able to reach the break-even point since our inception and have had to rely on outside capital resources. We anticipate making significant revenues for the next year. Over the next 12 months, subject to raising additional funds, we plan to primarily concentrate on our telecommunications business and associated projects.\nIn order to improve our liquidity, we intend to pursue additional equity financing from private placement sales of our equity securities or shareholders' loans. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further private placement financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources that are available to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results has not been significant.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.

As a result, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand both our United States and international telecommunications solutions services and staffing services capabilities. As we continue to expand our presence in the marketplace, we will target those customers going through new network deployments and wireless service upgrades.\n 26 \nWe expect to continue to increase our gross margins by leveraging our single-source end-to-end network to efficiently provide a full spectrum of end-to- end next-generation network solutions and staffing services to our customers. We believe our solutions and services offerings can alleviate some of the inefficiencies typically present in our industry, which result, in part, from the highly-fragmented nature of the telecommunications industry, limited access to skilled labor and the difficulty industry participants have in managing multiple specialty-service providers to address their needs. As a result, we believe we can provide superior service to our customers and eliminate certain redundancies and costs for them. We believe our ability to address a wide range of end-to-end solutions, network infrastructure and project-staffing service needs of our telecommunications industry clients is a key competitive advantage. Our ability to offer diverse technical capabilities (including design, engineering, construction, deployment, and installation and integration services) allows customers to turn to a single source for those specific specialty services, as well as to entrust us with the execution of entire turn-key solutions.\nWe have become a multi-faceted company with an international presence. We believe this platform will allow us to leverage our corporate and other fixed costs and capture gross margin benefits. Our platform is highly scalable. We typically hire workers to staff projects on a project-by-project basis and our other operating expenses are primarily fixed. Accordingly, we are generally able to deploy personnel to infrastructure projects in the United States and beyond without incremental increases in operating costs, allowing us to achieve greater margins. We believe this business model enables us to staff our business efficiently to meet changes in demand.\nFinally, given the worldwide popularity of telecommunications and wireless products and services, we will selectively pursue international expansion, which we believe represents a compelling opportunity for additional long-term growth.\nOur planned expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our operations management systems, financial and management controls and information systems and to hire, train and retain skilled telecommunications personnel. The timing and amount of investments in our expansion could affect the comparability of our results of operations in future periods.\nOur planned acquisitions will be timed with additions to our management team of skilled professionals with deep industry knowledge and a strong track record of execution. Our senior management team brings an average of over 30 years of individual experience across a broad range of disciplines. We believe our senior management team is a key driver of our success and is well-positioned to execute our strategy.\nWe were incorporated 2007, but functioned as a development stage company with limited activities through 2017. In April, 2017 we acquired AW Solutions.\nEnergy Alternatives\nWe have developed processes for the electro-reduction of carbon dioxide ( ERC\u201d). During the year, our patents on the ERC technology lapsed. During the year, our exclusive license agreement for a mixed-reactant fuel cell ( MRFC\u201d) expired due to non-payment of license fees by us. These events significantly impair our ability to carry on this line of business. Unless we renew the patents and reach a new agreement to licenses the MRFC technology, it will likely be necessary to discontinue this line of business.\nIn the past, we have contracted out our development work to various laboratories and carried out research and development on our ERC and MRFC technologies in our own internal laboratory with our own staff in Vancouver, BC. These activities include: experimentation to improve the process performance; process and economic modeling to optimize the costs of a commercial system; design and simulation of pilot systems for technology demonstration and validation; business development activities such as the establishment of strategic and technology development partners; and the design and fabrication of laboratory prototypes, among others.\n 27 \nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nChanges in Demand for Data Capacity and Reliability.\nThe telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to advances in technology, increased competition as telephone and cable companies converge, the growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services and increased governmental broadband stimulus funding. As a result of these factors, the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability. Telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment, provide flexibility in workforce sizing, expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success. These factors drive customer demand for our services.\nThe proliferation of smart phones and other wireless data devices has driven demand for mobile broadband. This demand and other advances in technology have prompted wireless carriers to upgrade their networks. Wireless carriers are actively increasing spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic, upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency and consolidate disparate technology platforms. These customer initiatives present long-term opportunities for us for the wireless services we provide. Further, the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of cellular traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber and coaxial networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites. These trends are increasing the demand for the types of services we provide.\nOur Ability to Recruit, Manage and Retain High-Quality IT and Telecommunications Personnel.\nThe shortage of skilled labor in the telecommunications industry and the difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled personnel can frequently limit the ability of specialty contractors to bid for and complete certain contracts. We believe our access to a skilled labor pool gives us a competitive edge over our competitors as we continue to expand.\nOur Ability to Integrate Our Acquired Business and Expand Internationally\nWe have completed one material acquisition April 25, 2017 and plan to consummate additional acquisitions in the near term. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses into our telecommunications platform. In addition, we believe international expansion represents a compelling opportunity for additional growth over the long-term because of the worldwide need for telecommunications infrastructure. We plan to expand our global presence either by expanding our current operations or by acquiring subsidiaries with international platforms.\nOur Ability to Expand and Diversify Our Customer Base.\nOur customers for specialty contracting services consist of leading telephone, wireless, cable television, utility and other companies. Historically, our revenue has been significantly concentrated in a small number of customers. Although we still operate at a net loss, our revenue this years has increased as we have acquired additional subsidiaries and diversified our customer base and revenue streams. The percentage of our revenue attributable to our top 10 customers, as well as our only customer that contributed at least 10% of our revenue in at least one of the years specified in the following table, were as follows:\nImpact of Recently-Completed Acquisitions\t\nWe have grown significantly and expanded our service offerings and geographic reach through a strategic acquisition on April 25, 2017. We have completed one (1) material acquisition of AW Solutions and initiated the new Telecommunication Division. We expect to regularly review opportunities, and periodically to engage in discussions, regarding possible additional acquisitions. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify, acquire and successfully integrate companies.\n 28 \nExpiration and cancelation of patents and licenses for ERC and MRFC technologies\nThe ERC and MRFC technologies relate to projects involving research and development of alternative energy methods and uses. The expiration of our patents and of our exclusive license agreement will significantly impair our ability to carry on this line of business. Unless we renew the patents and reach a new agreement to licenses the MRFC technology, it will likely be necessary to discontinue this line of business. As a result, we intend to focus on our telecommunications line of business in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our historical consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those related to recognition of revenue for costs, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, income taxes, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation expense, contingent consideration and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. These estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements. The impact of these policies affects our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nOther significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also important to understanding our historical consolidated financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report contain additional information related to our accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies described herein, and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nOur consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by management.\nBasis of Presentation/Principles of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, Carbon Commodity Corporation, Climate ESCO Ltd., Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., Mantra China Inc., Mantra China Limited, Mantra Media Corp., Mantra NextGen Power Inc., Mantra Wind Inc., AW Solutions, Inc.(from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017), Tropical Communications, Inc. (from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017) and AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC.(from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017). All the subsidiaries are wholly-owned with the exception of Climate ESCO Ltd., which is 64.55% owned, Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., which is 88.21% owned and AW Solutions, Inc., Tropical Communications, Inc., and AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC which are all 80.1% owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n 29 \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, equity component of convertible debt, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company records unbilled receivables for services performed but not billed. At May 31, 2017, unbilled receivables totaled $430,669, and are included in accounts receivable. Management reviews a customer's credit history before extending credit. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. Estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed each period, and changes are recorded in the period in which they become known. Management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable each period. This review considers the aging of account balances, historical bad debt experience, changes in customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, customer payment activity and other relevant factors. Should any of these factors change, the estimate made by management may also change. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $267,476 at May 31, 2017.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Automotive </td> <td>3-5 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Computer equipment and software </td> <td>3-7 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Leasehold improvements </td> <td>5 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Office equipment and furniture </td> <td>5 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Research equipment </td> <td>5 years straight-line basis </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill\nGoodwill was generated through the acquisition of AW Solutions in fiscal 2017 as the total consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nThe Company tests its goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in the Company's expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and the Company's consolidated financial results.\n 30 \nThe Company tests goodwill by estimating fair value using a Discounted Cash Flow ( DCF\u201d) model. The key assumptions used in the DCF model to determine the highest and best use of estimated future cash flows include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value and an estimate of a market participant's weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows to their present value. There were no impairment charges during the year ended May 31, 2017.\nIntangible Assets\nAt May 31, 2017, definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, tradenames and customer relationships which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1-10 years. At May 31, 2016, definite-lived intangible assets consisted of patents and were stated at cost. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. During the year ended May 31, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment loss related patents held of $59,060.\nThe Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. The Company has no intangibles with indefinite lives.\nFor long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. The Company measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.\nLong-lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.\nForeign Currency Translation\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the currency of measurement at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in income.\nThe Company's integrated foreign subsidiaries are financially or operationally dependent on the Company. The Company uses the temporal method to translate the accounts of its integrated operations into U.S. dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period, except for amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related asset. The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognized in income.\n 31 \nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company conducts business, and files federal and state income, franchise or net worth, tax returns in Canada, the United States, in various states within the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Company determines its filing obligations in a jurisdiction in accordance with existing statutory and case law. The Company may be subject to a reassessment of federal and provincial income taxes by Canadian tax authorities for a period of three years from the date of the original notice of assessment in respect of any particular taxation year. For Canadian and U.S. income tax returns, the open taxation years range from 2010 to 2017. In certain circumstances, the U.S. federal statute of limitations can reach beyond the standard three year period. U.S. state statutes of limitations for income tax assessment vary from state to state. Tax authorities of Canada and U.S. have not audited any of the Company's, or its subsidiaries', income tax returns for the open taxation years noted above.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, and in particular, any valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability. The Company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, which should reduce taxable income in future periods. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income.\nThe Company follows the guidance set forth within ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC Topic 740\u201d) which prescribes a two-step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, recognition and classification of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Penalties and interest, if incurred, would be recorded as a component of current income tax expense.\nThe Company received a tax notice from the Puerto Rican government requesting payment of taxes related to 2014 in the amount of $166,084 plus penalties and interest of $87,027 for a total obligation due of $253,111. This tax assessment is included in accrued expenses at May 31, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are generated from applications and infrastructure services. The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10, Revenue Recognition\u201d. The Company recognizes revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\nThe applications and infrastructure revenues are derived from contracts to provide technical engineering services along with contracting services to commercial and governmental customers. The Company's service contracts generally require specific tasks or services that the Company must perform under the contract. The Company recognizes revenues associated with these services upon the completion of the related task or service which is at the time the four revenue recognition criteria have been met. Direct costs incurred related to performance of the task or service are deferred and recorded as prepaid expense and are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.\nThe Company also generates revenue from service contracts with certain customers. These contracts are accounted for under the proportional performance method. Under this method, revenue is recognized in proportion to the value provided to the customer for each project as of each reporting date.\nThe Company records unbilled receivables for revenues earned, but not yet billed.\n 32 \nDuring the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company performed research and development services. The Company recognized revenue under research contracts when a contract has been executed, the contract price is fixed and determinable, delivery of services or products has occurred, and collectability of the contract price is considered reasonably assured and can be reasonably estimated. Revenue was based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates plus other billable direct costs.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation and amortization), direct materials, insurance claims and other direct costs.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected by the Company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period.\nLoss Per Share\nThe Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, \"Earnings per Share\" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at May 31, 2017, the Company had 647,182,222 (2016 - 56,260,229) dilutive potential shares outstanding.\nComprehensive Loss\nASC 220, Comprehensive Income,\u201d establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As at May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivables. The Company maintains its cash balances with high-credit-quality financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be withdrawn upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk.\n 33 \nThe Company provides credit to customers on an uncollateralized basis after evaluating client creditworthiness. For the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017, two customers accounted for 48% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017. In addition, amounts due from these customers represented 39% and 8%, respectively, of trade accounts receivable as of May 31, 2017.\nThe Company's customers are primarily located within the domestic United States of America and Puerto Rico. Revenues generated within the domestic United States of America accounted for approximately 94% of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017. Revenues generated from customers in Puerto Rico accounted for approximately 6% of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures and discloses the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy prescribed by US generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value hierarchy has three levels, which are based on reliable available inputs of observable data. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The three-level hierarchy is defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and.\nLevel 3 - fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nFinancial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, loans payable and convertible debentures. Derivative liabilities are determined based on Level 3\u201d inputs, which are significant and unobservable and have the lowest priority. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3\u201d during the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.\nOur financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2017 and 2016, consisted of the following:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total fair\nvalue at\nMay 31,\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quoted prices\nin active\nmarkets\n(Level 1)\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Significant\nother\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2)\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Significant\nunobservable\ninputs\n(Level 3)\n$ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Description: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Derivative liability (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,760,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,760,067 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total fair\nvalue at\nMay 31,\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Quoted prices\nin active\nmarkets\n(Level 1)\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Significant\nother\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2)\n$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Significant\nunobservable\ninputs\n(Level 3)\n$ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Description: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Derivative liability (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The Company has estimated the fair value of these derivatives using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, Monte-Carlo model or a Binomial Model based. \n 34 \nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial statement. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. See Note 10 for additional information.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging\u201d and all derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. The Company uses estimates of fair value to value its derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able market participants. In general, the Company's policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads, relying first on observable data from active markets. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair values and may not be realizable. The Company categorizes its fair value estimates in accordance with ASC 820 based on the hierarchical framework associated with the three levels of price transparency utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value as discussed above. As at May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had a $3,760,067 and $978,245 derivative liability, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods, as amended, beginning after December 15, 2018. The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is effective for the Company on June 1, 2019, and early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company continues to evaluate the standard and has not yet selected a transition method.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The Company has elected to early adopt the requirements of ASU 2015-17 and the results of such adoption are presented within these consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company continues to evaluate the effects of ASU 2016-02 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations ( ASU 2016-08\u201d). The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606: The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements.\n 35 \nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-10 clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606: The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-12 provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients. Specifically, the amendments in this update (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion in step 1, and provides additional clarification for when to recognize revenue for a contract that fails step 1, (2) permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception, and clarifies that the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration, (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (5) clarifies that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application. Further, accounting for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy GAAP are irrelevant to the assessment of whether a contract is complete. In addition, the amendments permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts or only to contracts that are not completed contracts, and (6) clarifies that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. However, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-12 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). The Amendments in this Update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-01 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d). This standard will simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Current guidance requires that companies compute the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 by performing procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. This standard will require companies to perform annual or interim goodwill impairment tests by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period, and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption of this standard is permitted on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.\n 36 \nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or result of operations.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal year Ended May 31, 2017 Compared to Fiscal year Ended May 31, 2016\nThe following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOur operating results for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Statement of Operations Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(as revised) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,069,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,011,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>922,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,761,829 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(852,564 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total other expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,109,458 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,367,296 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,871,287 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,219,860 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss per share, basic </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.06 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.03 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss per share, diluted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.06 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.03 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Basic weighted average shares outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,085,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,327,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Diluted weighted average shares outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance sheet data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>345,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts receivable, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,623,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total current assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,100,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill and intangible assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,964,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,615 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,188,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>171,027 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total current liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,966,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,845,939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,308 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stockholders' (deficit) equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,777,296 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,678,220 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased from $70,298 for the year ended May 31, 2016 to $1,069,917 for the year ended May 31, 2017. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders increased from $2,219,860 for the year ended May 31, 2016 to $6,871,287 for the year ended May 31, 2017. As of May 31, 2016, our stockholders' deficit was $4,777,296. During 2017, all of our revenue and a significant portion of our expense was generated by our acquired company AW Solutions. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company generated a nominal amount of revenue from the provision of research and development services.\n 37 \nA significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years. We are currently party to numerous master service agreements, and typically have multiple agreements with each of our customers. Master Service Agreements (MSA's) generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discreet pricing for individual tasks. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer's own employees and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In most cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice. The remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects. Long-term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date. Short-term contracts for specific projects are generally of three to four months in duration.\nThe percentage of revenue from long-term contracts varies between periods depending on the mix of work performed under our contracts. All revenues derived from master service agreements are from customers that are serviced by our applications and infrastructure and professional services segments. The decline in revenues from multi-year master service agreements is due to the addition of our cloud services segment and managed services segment, which do not derive revenues from multi-year master service agreements.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue from: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Infrastructure & Professional Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,069,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nil </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy Services & Solutions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nil </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>As a percentage of total revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Infrastructure & Professional Services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy Services & Solutions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation and amortization), direct materials, insurance claims and other direct costs.\nFor a majority of the contract services we perform, our customers provide all required materials while we provide the necessary personnel, tools and equipment. Materials supplied by our customers, for which the customer retains financial and performance risk, are not included in our revenue or costs of revenues. We expect cost of revenues to continue to increase if we succeed in continuing to grow our revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs.\nGeneral and administrative costs include all of our corporate costs, as well as costs of our subsidiaries' management personnel and administrative overhead. These costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses, including legal, consulting and professional fees, information technology and development costs, provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense and other costs that are not directly related to performance of our services under customer contracts. Information technology and development costs included in general and administrative expenses are primarily incurred to support and to enhance our operating efficiency. We expect these expenses to continue to generally increase as we expand our operations, but expect that such expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease if we succeed in increasing revenues.\nGeneral and administrative costs were $106,114 for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to $559,316 for the year ended May 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was because of cost cutting resulting in less staff and overhead prior to the acquisition of AW Solutions.\n 38 \nSalaries & Wages Expenses.\nSalaries and wages were $4,845,260 for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to $335,638 for the year ended May 31, 2016. The increase during the year ended May 31, 2017, was primarily the result of issuing 124,251,510 shares with a fair value of $3,976,048 to two new directors of the Company in exchange for services provided.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe had accounts receivable at May 31, 2017 and 2016 of $1,623,200 and $7,358, respectively. At May 31, 2016, the Company's receivables consisted solely of input tax credits receivable. At May 31, 2017, almost all of the Company's receivables were trade accounts receivables related to AW Solutions.\nCapital expenditures\nWe had capital expenditures of $0 and $16,748 for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect our capital expenditures for the 12 months ending May 31, 2018 to increase to some degree with in the integration of AW Solutions. These capital expenditures will be primarily utilized for equipment needed related to fiber operations and office equipment. We expect to fund such capital expenditures out of our working capital.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill was $1,503,633 was for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to nil for the year ended May 31, 2016.\nGoodwill was generated through the acquisitions we have made during 2017. As the total consideration we paid for our completed acquisitions exceeded the value of the net assets acquired, we recorded goodwill for each of our completed acquisitions (see Note 3) of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). At the date of acquisition, we performed a valuation to determine the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, along with the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired. The goodwill is attributable to synergies and economies of scale provided to us by the acquired entity.\nWe perform our annual impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is consistent with our operating segments. Our two (2) reportable segments are infrastructure and professional services, and energy services. Infrastructure and professional services comprised of AW Solutions the energy services operating segment is comprised of Mantra Energy Alternatives (MEA). These reporting units are aggregated to form two (2) operating segments and two (2) reportable segments for financial reporting and for the evaluation of goodwill for impairment. As our business evolves and the acquired entities continue to be integrated, our operating segments may change. This may require us to reassess how goodwill at our reporting units are evaluated for impairment.\nWe perform the impairment testing at least annually or at other times if we believe that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment to the carrying value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill. If it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists, the second step of the goodwill impairment test should be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nWe consider the results of an income approach and a market approach in determining the fair value of the reportable units. We evaluated the forecasted revenue using a discounted cash flow model for each of the reporting units. We also noted no unusual cost factors that would impact operations based on the nature of the working capital requirements of the components comprising the reportable units. Current operating results, including any losses, are evaluated by us in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties. Key assumptions used in the income approach in evaluating goodwill are forecasts for each of the reporting unit revenue growth rates along with forecasted discounted free cash flows for each reporting unit, aggregated into each reporting segment. For the market approach, we used the guideline public company method, under which the fair value of a business is estimated by comparing the subject company to similar companies with publicly-traded ownership interests. From these guideline\u201d companies, valuation multiples are derived and then applied to the appropriate operating statistics of the subject company to arrive at indications of value.\n 39 \nWhile we use available information to prepare estimates and to perform impairment evaluations, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates or related projections, resulting in impairment related to recorded goodwill balances. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. We can provide no assurances that, if such conditions occur, they will not trigger impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods.\nEvents that could cause the risk for impairment to increase are the loss of a major customer or group of customers, the loss of key personnel and changes to current legislation that may impact our industry or its customers' industries.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL's\u201d) of $9,955,092 and $4,047,230, respectively that will be available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These NOL's begin to expire in 2027.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provide for annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss, capital loss and credit carryforwards if the Company were to undergo an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change occurs whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by 5-percent shareholders, as defined in Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such 5-percent shareholders at any time over the preceding three years. In the event such ownership change occurs, the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses capital losses and credits prior to full utilization.\nThe Company has not completed a study to assess whether ownership change has occurred as a result of the Company's acquisition of AWS and related issuance of shares (See Note 3). However, as a result of the issuance of common shares in 2017, the Company believes an ownership change under Sec. 382 may have occurred. As a result of this ownership change certain of the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and credit carryforwards will expire prior to full utilization.\nThe Company performs an analysis each year to determine whether the expected future income will more likely than not be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets. The Company's recent operating results and projections of future income weighed heavily in the Company's overall assessment. Prior to 2017, there were no provisions (or benefits) for income taxes because the Company had sustained cumulative losses since the commencement of operations.\nThe Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and to income taxes in various states in the United States. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. Due to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards all years remain open to examination by the major domestic taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. In addition, all of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are still subject to adjustment.\n 40 \nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nAs of May 31, 2017, our total current assets were $2,100,457 and our total current liabilities were $9,966,073, resulting in a working capital deficit of $7,865,616 compared to working capital deficit of $2,832,673 as at May 31, 2016.\nWe have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard we have historically raised additional capital through equity offerings and loan transactions.\nCash Flows\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Used in Operating Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(403,732 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(463,370 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Provided by (Used) In Investing Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,748 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>631,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>473,791 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash (decrease) increase during the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,327 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in cash that we experienced during fiscal 2017 as compared to the decrease of cash during fiscal 2016 was primarily due to acquisition of AW Solutions and increased funding activities during the year, which, added cash to our balance sheet. We obtained $631,103 during the year in funding. This was offset in part by cash used in operating activities $403,732. We expect that our cash position will increase next year, due to operating profits in our telecommunications division. We have not been able to reach the break-even point since our inception and have had to rely on outside capital resources. We anticipate making significant revenues for the next year. Over the next 12 months, subject to raising additional funds, we plan to primarily concentrate on our telecommunications business and associated projects.\nIn order to improve our liquidity, we intend to pursue additional equity financing from private placement sales of our equity securities or shareholders' loans. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further private placement financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources that are available to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results has not been significant.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may\u201d will,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate\u201d and continue,\u201d or similar words. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.\nReaders are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Important factors known to us could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time. We believe that its assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business and operations of the Company. No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions. Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for the Company's services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.\nBusiness Overview\nTelecommunications\nTelecommunications providers and enterprise customers continue to seek and outsource solutions in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment, provide flexibility in workforce sizing and expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring. As a result, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand both our United States and international telecommunications solutions services and staffing services capabilities. As we continue to expand our presence in the marketplace, we will target those customers going through new network deployments and wireless service upgrades.\n 26 \nWe expect to continue to increase our gross margins by leveraging our single-source end-to-end network to efficiently provide a full spectrum of end-to- end next-generation network solutions and staffing services to our customers. We believe our solutions and services offerings can alleviate some of the inefficiencies typically present in our industry, which result, in part, from the highly-fragmented nature of the telecommunications industry, limited access to skilled labor and the difficulty industry participants have in managing multiple specialty-service providers to address their needs. As a result, we believe we can provide superior service to our customers and eliminate certain redundancies and costs for them. We believe our ability to address a wide range of end-to-end solutions, network infrastructure and project-staffing service needs of our telecommunications industry clients is a key competitive advantage. Our ability to offer diverse technical capabilities (including design, engineering, construction, deployment, and installation and integration services) allows customers to turn to a single source for those specific specialty services, as well as to entrust us with the execution of entire turn-key solutions.\nWe have become a multi-faceted company with an international presence. We believe this platform will allow us to leverage our corporate and other fixed costs and capture gross margin benefits. Our platform is highly scalable. We typically hire workers to staff projects on a project-by-project basis and our other operating expenses are primarily fixed. Accordingly, we are generally able to deploy personnel to infrastructure projects in the United States and beyond without incremental increases in operating costs, allowing us to achieve greater margins. We believe this business model enables us to staff our business efficiently to meet changes in demand.\nFinally, given the worldwide popularity of telecommunications and wireless products and services, we will selectively pursue international expansion, which we believe represents a compelling opportunity for additional long-term growth.\nOur planned expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our operations management systems, financial and management controls and information systems and to hire, train and retain skilled telecommunications personnel. The timing and amount of investments in our expansion could affect the comparability of our results of operations in future periods.\nOur planned acquisitions will be timed with additions to our management team of skilled professionals with deep industry knowledge and a strong track record of execution. Our senior management team brings an average of over 30 years of individual experience across a broad range of disciplines. We believe our senior management team is a key driver of our success and is well-positioned to execute our strategy.\nWe were incorporated 2007, but functioned as a development stage company with limited activities through 2017. In April, 2017 we acquired AW Solutions.\nEnergy Alternatives\nWe have developed processes for the electro-reduction of carbon dioxide ( ERC\u201d). During the year, our patents on the ERC technology lapsed. During the year, our exclusive license agreement for a mixed-reactant fuel cell ( MRFC\u201d) expired due to non-payment of license fees by us. These events significantly impair our ability to carry on this line of business. Unless we renew the patents and reach a new agreement to licenses the MRFC technology, it will likely be necessary to discontinue this line of business.\nIn the past, we have contracted out our development work to various laboratories and carried out research and development on our ERC and MRFC technologies in our own internal laboratory with our own staff in Vancouver, BC. These activities include: experimentation to improve the process performance; process and economic modeling to optimize the costs of a commercial system; design and simulation of pilot systems for technology demonstration and validation; business development activities such as the establishment of strategic and technology development partners; and the design and fabrication of laboratory prototypes, among others.\n 27 \nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nChanges in Demand for Data Capacity and Reliability.\nThe telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to advances in technology, increased competition as telephone and cable companies converge, the growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services and increased governmental broadband stimulus funding. As a result of these factors, the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability. Telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering, construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment, provide flexibility in workforce sizing, expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success. These factors drive customer demand for our services.\nThe proliferation of smart phones and other wireless data devices has driven demand for mobile broadband. This demand and other advances in technology have prompted wireless carriers to upgrade their networks. Wireless carriers are actively increasing spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic, upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency and consolidate disparate technology platforms. These customer initiatives present long-term opportunities for us for the wireless services we provide. Further, the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers. As the demand for mobile broadband grows, the amount of cellular traffic that must be backhauled\u201d over customers' fiber and coaxial networks increases and, as a result, carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites. These trends are increasing the demand for the types of services we provide.\nOur Ability to Recruit, Manage and Retain High-Quality IT and Telecommunications Personnel.\nThe shortage of skilled labor in the telecommunications industry and the difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled personnel can frequently limit the ability of specialty contractors to bid for and complete certain contracts. We believe our access to a skilled labor pool gives us a competitive edge over our competitors as we continue to expand.\nOur Ability to Integrate Our Acquired Business and Expand Internationally\nWe have completed one material acquisition April 25, 2017 and plan to consummate additional acquisitions in the near term. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses into our telecommunications platform. In addition, we believe international expansion represents a compelling opportunity for additional growth over the long-term because of the worldwide need for telecommunications infrastructure. We plan to expand our global presence either by expanding our current operations or by acquiring subsidiaries with international platforms.\nOur Ability to Expand and Diversify Our Customer Base.\nOur customers for specialty contracting services consist of leading telephone, wireless, cable television, utility and other companies. Historically, our revenue has been significantly concentrated in a small number of customers. Although we still operate at a net loss, our revenue this years has increased as we have acquired additional subsidiaries and diversified our customer base and revenue streams. The percentage of our revenue attributable to our top 10 customers, as well as our only customer that contributed at least 10% of our revenue in at least one of the years specified in the following table, were as follows:\nImpact of Recently-Completed Acquisitions\t\nWe have grown significantly and expanded our service offerings and geographic reach through a strategic acquisition on April 25, 2017. We have completed one (1) material acquisition of AW Solutions and initiated the new Telecommunication Division. We expect to regularly review opportunities, and periodically to engage in discussions, regarding possible additional acquisitions. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify, acquire and successfully integrate companies.\n 28 \nExpiration and cancelation of patents and licenses for ERC and MRFC technologies\nThe ERC and MRFC technologies relate to projects involving research and development of alternative energy methods and uses. The expiration of our patents and of our exclusive license agreement will significantly impair our ability to carry on this line of business. Unless we renew the patents and reach a new agreement to licenses the MRFC technology, it will likely be necessary to discontinue this line of business. As a result, we intend to focus on our telecommunications line of business in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our historical consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those related to recognition of revenue for costs, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, income taxes, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation expense, contingent consideration and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. These estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements. The impact of these policies affects our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nOther significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also important to understanding our historical consolidated financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report contain additional information related to our accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies described herein, and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nOur consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by management.\nBasis of Presentation/Principles of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, Carbon Commodity Corporation, Climate ESCO Ltd., Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., Mantra China Inc., Mantra China Limited, Mantra Media Corp., Mantra NextGen Power Inc., Mantra Wind Inc., AW Solutions, Inc.(from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017), Tropical Communications, Inc. (from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017) and AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC.(from the date of acquisition, April 25, 2017). All the subsidiaries are wholly-owned with the exception of Climate ESCO Ltd., which is 64.55% owned, Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., which is 88.21% owned and AW Solutions, Inc., Tropical Communications, Inc., and AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC which are all 80.1% owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n 29 \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, equity component of convertible debt, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company records unbilled receivables for services performed but not billed. At May 31, 2017, unbilled receivables totaled $430,669, and are included in accounts receivable. Management reviews a customer's credit history before extending credit. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. Estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed each period, and changes are recorded in the period in which they become known. Management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable each period. This review considers the aging of account balances, historical bad debt experience, changes in customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, customer payment activity and other relevant factors. Should any of these factors change, the estimate made by management may also change. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $267,476 at May 31, 2017.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates:\n\nGoodwill\nGoodwill was generated through the acquisition of AW Solutions in fiscal 2017 as the total consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nThe Company tests its goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in the Company's expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and the Company's consolidated financial results.\n 30 \nThe Company tests goodwill by estimating fair value using a Discounted Cash Flow ( DCF\u201d) model. The key assumptions used in the DCF model to determine the highest and best use of estimated future cash flows include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value and an estimate of a market participant's weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows to their present value. There were no impairment charges during the year ended May 31, 2017.\nIntangible Assets\nAt May 31, 2017, definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, tradenames and customer relationships which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1-10 years. At May 31, 2016, definite-lived intangible assets consisted of patents and were stated at cost. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. During the year ended May 31, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment loss related patents held of $59,060.\nThe Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. The Company has no intangibles with indefinite lives.\nFor long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. The Company measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.\nLong-lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.\nForeign Currency Translation\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the currency of measurement at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in income.\nThe Company's integrated foreign subsidiaries are financially or operationally dependent on the Company. The Company uses the temporal method to translate the accounts of its integrated operations into U.S. dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period, except for amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related asset. The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognized in income.\n 31 \nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company conducts business, and files federal and state income, franchise or net worth, tax returns in Canada, the United States, in various states within the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Company determines its filing obligations in a jurisdiction in accordance with existing statutory and case law. The Company may be subject to a reassessment of federal and provincial income taxes by Canadian tax authorities for a period of three years from the date of the original notice of assessment in respect of any particular taxation year. For Canadian and U.S. income tax returns, the open taxation years range from 2010 to 2017. In certain circumstances, the U.S. federal statute of limitations can reach beyond the standard three year period. U.S. state statutes of limitations for income tax assessment vary from state to state. Tax authorities of Canada and U.S. have not audited any of the Company's, or its subsidiaries', income tax returns for the open taxation years noted above.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, and in particular, any valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability. The Company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, which should reduce taxable income in future periods. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income.\nThe Company follows the guidance set forth within ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC Topic 740\u201d) which prescribes a two-step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, recognition and classification of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Penalties and interest, if incurred, would be recorded as a component of current income tax expense.\nThe Company received a tax notice from the Puerto Rican government requesting payment of taxes related to 2014 in the amount of $166,084 plus penalties and interest of $87,027 for a total obligation due of $253,111. This tax assessment is included in accrued expenses at May 31, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are generated from applications and infrastructure services. The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10, Revenue Recognition\u201d. The Company recognizes revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\nThe applications and infrastructure revenues are derived from contracts to provide technical engineering services along with contracting services to commercial and governmental customers. The Company's service contracts generally require specific tasks or services that the Company must perform under the contract. The Company recognizes revenues associated with these services upon the completion of the related task or service which is at the time the four revenue recognition criteria have been met. Direct costs incurred related to performance of the task or service are deferred and recorded as prepaid expense and are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.\nThe Company also generates revenue from service contracts with certain customers. These contracts are accounted for under the proportional performance method. Under this method, revenue is recognized in proportion to the value provided to the customer for each project as of each reporting date.\nThe Company records unbilled receivables for revenues earned, but not yet billed.\n 32 \nDuring the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company performed research and development services. The Company recognized revenue under research contracts when a contract has been executed, the contract price is fixed and determinable, delivery of services or products has occurred, and collectability of the contract price is considered reasonably assured and can be reasonably estimated. Revenue was based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates plus other billable direct costs.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation and amortization), direct materials, insurance claims and other direct costs.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected by the Company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period.\nLoss Per Share\nThe Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, \"Earnings per Share\" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at May 31, 2017, the Company had 647,182,222 (2016 - 56,260,229) dilutive potential shares outstanding.\nComprehensive Loss\nASC 220, Comprehensive Income,\u201d establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As at May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivables. The Company maintains its cash balances with high-credit-quality financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be withdrawn upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk.\n 33 \nThe Company provides credit to customers on an uncollateralized basis after evaluating client creditworthiness. For the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017, two customers accounted for 48% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017. In addition, amounts due from these customers represented 39% and 8%, respectively, of trade accounts receivable as of May 31, 2017.\nThe Company's customers are primarily located within the domestic United States of America and Puerto Rico. Revenues generated within the domestic United States of America accounted for approximately 94% of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017. Revenues generated from customers in Puerto Rico accounted for approximately 6% of consolidated revenues for the period from April 25, 2017 to May 31, 2017.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures and discloses the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy prescribed by US generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value hierarchy has three levels, which are based on reliable available inputs of observable data. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The three-level hierarchy is defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and.\nLevel 3 - fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nFinancial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, loans payable and convertible debentures. Derivative liabilities are determined based on Level 3\u201d inputs, which are significant and unobservable and have the lowest priority. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3\u201d during the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.\nOur financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2017 and 2016, consisted of the following:\n\n\n (1) The Company has estimated the fair value of these derivatives using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, Monte-Carlo model or a Binomial Model based. \n 34 \nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial statement. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. See Note 10 for additional information.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging\u201d and all derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. The Company uses estimates of fair value to value its derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able market participants. In general, the Company's policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads, relying first on observable data from active markets. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair values and may not be realizable. The Company categorizes its fair value estimates in accordance with ASC 820 based on the hierarchical framework associated with the three levels of price transparency utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value as discussed above. As at May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had a $3,760,067 and $978,245 derivative liability, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods, as amended, beginning after December 15, 2018. The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is effective for the Company on June 1, 2019, and early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company continues to evaluate the standard and has not yet selected a transition method.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The Company has elected to early adopt the requirements of ASU 2015-17 and the results of such adoption are presented within these consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which is effective for nonpublic entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company continues to evaluate the effects of ASU 2016-02 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations ( ASU 2016-08\u201d). The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606: The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements.\n 35 \nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-10 clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606: The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-12 provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients. Specifically, the amendments in this update (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion in step 1, and provides additional clarification for when to recognize revenue for a contract that fails step 1, (2) permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception, and clarifies that the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration, (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (5) clarifies that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application. Further, accounting for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy GAAP are irrelevant to the assessment of whether a contract is complete. In addition, the amendments permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts or only to contracts that are not completed contracts, and (6) clarifies that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. However, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-12 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). The Amendments in this Update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-01 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d). This standard will simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Current guidance requires that companies compute the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 by performing procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. This standard will require companies to perform annual or interim goodwill impairment tests by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period, and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption of this standard is permitted on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.\n 36 \nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or result of operations.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal year Ended May 31, 2017 Compared to Fiscal year Ended May 31, 2016\nThe following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOur operating results for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:\n\n\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased from $70,298 for the year ended May 31, 2016 to $1,069,917 for the year ended May 31, 2017. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders increased from $2,219,860 for the year ended May 31, 2016 to $6,871,287 for the year ended May 31, 2017. As of May 31, 2016, our stockholders' deficit was $4,777,296. During 2017, all of our revenue and a significant portion of our expense was generated by our acquired company AW Solutions. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company generated a nominal amount of revenue from the provision of research and development services.\n 37 \nA significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years. We are currently party to numerous master service agreements, and typically have multiple agreements with each of our customers. Master Service Agreements (MSA's) generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discreet pricing for individual tasks. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer's own employees and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In most cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice. The remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects. Long-term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date. Short-term contracts for specific projects are generally of three to four months in duration.\nThe percentage of revenue from long-term contracts varies between periods depending on the mix of work performed under our contracts. All revenues derived from master service agreements are from customers that are serviced by our applications and infrastructure and professional services segments. The decline in revenues from multi-year master service agreements is due to the addition of our cloud services segment and managed services segment, which do not derive revenues from multi-year master service agreements.\n\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment (excluding depreciation and amortization), direct materials, insurance claims and other direct costs.\nFor a majority of the contract services we perform, our customers provide all required materials while we provide the necessary personnel, tools and equipment. Materials supplied by our customers, for which the customer retains financial and performance risk, are not included in our revenue or costs of revenues. We expect cost of revenues to continue to increase if we succeed in continuing to grow our revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs.\nGeneral and administrative costs include all of our corporate costs, as well as costs of our subsidiaries' management personnel and administrative overhead. These costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses, including legal, consulting and professional fees, information technology and development costs, provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense and other costs that are not directly related to performance of our services under customer contracts. Information technology and development costs included in general and administrative expenses are primarily incurred to support and to enhance our operating efficiency. We expect these expenses to continue to generally increase as we expand our operations, but expect that such expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease if we succeed in increasing revenues.\nGeneral and administrative costs were $106,114 for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to $559,316 for the year ended May 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was because of cost cutting resulting in less staff and overhead prior to the acquisition of AW Solutions.\n 38 \nSalaries & Wages Expenses.\nSalaries and wages were $4,845,260 for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to $335,638 for the year ended May 31, 2016. The increase during the year ended May 31, 2017, was primarily the result of issuing 124,251,510 shares with a fair value of $3,976,048 to two new directors of the Company in exchange for services provided.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe had accounts receivable at May 31, 2017 and 2016 of $1,623,200 and $7,358, respectively. At May 31, 2016, the Company's receivables consisted solely of input tax credits receivable. At May 31, 2017, almost all of the Company's receivables were trade accounts receivables related to AW Solutions.\nCapital expenditures\nWe had capital expenditures of $0 and $16,748 for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect our capital expenditures for the 12 months ending May 31, 2018 to increase to some degree with in the integration of AW Solutions. These capital expenditures will be primarily utilized for equipment needed related to fiber operations and office equipment. We expect to fund such capital expenditures out of our working capital.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill was $1,503,633 was for the year ended May 31, 2017, compared to nil for the year ended May 31, 2016.\nGoodwill was generated through the acquisitions we have made during 2017. As the total consideration we paid for our completed acquisitions exceeded the value of the net assets acquired, we recorded goodwill for each of our completed acquisitions (see Note 3) of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). At the date of acquisition, we performed a valuation to determine the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, along with the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired. The goodwill is attributable to synergies and economies of scale provided to us by the acquired entity.\nWe perform our annual impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is consistent with our operating segments. Our two (2) reportable segments are infrastructure and professional services, and energy services. Infrastructure and professional services comprised of AW Solutions the energy services operating segment is comprised of Mantra Energy Alternatives (MEA). These reporting units are aggregated to form two (2) operating segments and two (2) reportable segments for financial reporting and for the evaluation of goodwill for impairment. As our business evolves and the acquired entities continue to be integrated, our operating segments may change. This may require us to reassess how goodwill at our reporting units are evaluated for impairment.\nWe perform the impairment testing at least annually or at other times if we believe that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment to the carrying value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill. If it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists, the second step of the goodwill impairment test should be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nWe consider the results of an income approach and a market approach in determining the fair value of the reportable units. We evaluated the forecasted revenue using a discounted cash flow model for each of the reporting units. We also noted no unusual cost factors that would impact operations based on the nature of the working capital requirements of the components comprising the reportable units. Current operating results, including any losses, are evaluated by us in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties. Key assumptions used in the income approach in evaluating goodwill are forecasts for each of the reporting unit revenue growth rates along with forecasted discounted free cash flows for each reporting unit, aggregated into each reporting segment. For the market approach, we used the guideline public company method, under which the fair value of a business is estimated by comparing the subject company to similar companies with publicly-traded ownership interests. From these guideline\u201d companies, valuation multiples are derived and then applied to the appropriate operating statistics of the subject company to arrive at indications of value.\n 39 \nWhile we use available information to prepare estimates and to perform impairment evaluations, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates or related projections, resulting in impairment related to recorded goodwill balances. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. We can provide no assurances that, if such conditions occur, they will not trigger impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods.\nEvents that could cause the risk for impairment to increase are the loss of a major customer or group of customers, the loss of key personnel and changes to current legislation that may impact our industry or its customers' industries.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of May 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL's\u201d) of $9,955,092 and $4,047,230, respectively that will be available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These NOL's begin to expire in 2027.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provide for annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss, capital loss and credit carryforwards if the Company were to undergo an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change occurs whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by 5-percent shareholders, as defined in Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such 5-percent shareholders at any time over the preceding three years. In the event such ownership change occurs, the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses capital losses and credits prior to full utilization.\nThe Company has not completed a study to assess whether ownership change has occurred as a result of the Company's acquisition of AWS and related issuance of shares (See Note 3). However, as a result of the issuance of common shares in 2017, the Company believes an ownership change under Sec. 382 may have occurred. As a result of this ownership change certain of the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and credit carryforwards will expire prior to full utilization.\nThe Company performs an analysis each year to determine whether the expected future income will more likely than not be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets. The Company's recent operating results and projections of future income weighed heavily in the Company's overall assessment. Prior to 2017, there were no provisions (or benefits) for income taxes because the Company had sustained cumulative losses since the commencement of operations.\nThe Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and to income taxes in various states in the United States. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. Due to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards all years remain open to examination by the major domestic taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. In addition, all of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are still subject to adjustment.\n 40 \nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nAs of May 31, 2017, our total current assets were $2,100,457 and our total current liabilities were $9,966,073, resulting in a working capital deficit of $7,865,616 compared to working capital deficit of $2,832,673 as at May 31, 2016.\nWe have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard we have historically raised additional capital through equity offerings and loan transactions.\nCash Flows\n\nThe increase in cash that we experienced during fiscal 2017 as compared to the decrease of cash during fiscal 2016 was primarily due to acquisition of AW Solutions and increased funding activities during the year, which, added cash to our balance sheet. We obtained $631,103 during the year in funding. This was offset in part by cash used in operating activities $403,732. We expect that our cash position will increase next year, due to operating profits in our telecommunications division. We have not been able to reach the break-even point since our inception and have had to rely on outside capital resources. We anticipate making significant revenues for the next year. Over the next 12 months, subject to raising additional funds, we plan to primarily concentrate on our telecommunications business and associated projects.\nIn order to improve our liquidity, we intend to pursue additional equity financing from private placement sales of our equity securities or shareholders' loans. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further private placement financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources that are available to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results has not been significant.", "item_7_tables": "Table 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Automotive </td> <td>3-5
