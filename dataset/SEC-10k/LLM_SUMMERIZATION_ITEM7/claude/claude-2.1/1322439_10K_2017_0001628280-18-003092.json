MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d our consolidated financial data set forth in Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the risk factors identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\nGeneral Overview\nWe are Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc., a Marshall Islands corporation incorporated on March 23, 2005 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. We own one of the largest fleets of Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk vessels in the world. Supramax/Ultramax vessels dry bulk are vessels which are constructed with on-board cranes, ranging in size from approximately 50,000 to 59,000 dwt and Ultramax dry bulk vessels range in size from 60,000 to 65,000 dwt. They are considered a sub-category of the Handymax segment typically defined as 40,000 to 65,000 dwt. We transport a broad range of major and minor bulk cargoes, including but not limited to coal, grain, ore, petcoke, cement and fertilizer, along worldwide shipping routes. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated a modern fleet of 47 Handymax dry bulk vessels. We chartered-in a 61,400 dwt, 2013 built newbuilding Japanese vessel for approximately four years. In addition, the Company charters-in third-party vessels on a short to medium term basis.\nWe are focused on maintaining a high quality fleet that is concentrated primarily in Supramax/ Ultramax dry bulk carriers. These vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on-board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of Panamax dry bulk vessels, which range in size from 72,000 to 83,000 dwt and rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes. We believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the Supramax class vessels make them attractive to cargo interests and vessel charterers. The 47 vessels in our operating fleet, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 2,683,751 dwt, have an average age of 8.2 years as of December 31, 2017.\nRefinancing\nOn December 8, 2017, the Company, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, completed a refinancing of approximately $265,000,000 under (i) the First Lien Facility and (ii) the Second Lien Facility, through (a) the New First Lien Facility of $65,000,000, and (b) the issuance by Shipco, the Norwegian Bond Debt of $200,000,000. In addition, Shipco entered into the Super Senior Facility of $15,000,000. For more information about the terms of the New First Lien Facility, the Norwegian Bank Debt and the Super Senior Facility, see Note 8. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nCorporate Reorganization\nIn connection with the refinancing transactions, the Company consummated an internal reorganization. As part of the internal reorganization, Eagle Shipping transferred ownership of certain wholly-owned vessel-owning subsidiaries to Shipco, such that Shipco became the parent to 28 vessel-owning subsidiaries. Additionally, all management and technical services will now be conducted under Eagle Bulk Management LLC, a newly-formed limited liability company existing under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nUltraco Debt Facility\nOn June 28, 2017, Ultraco entered into the Ultraco Debt Facility, which provided for a multi-draw senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to the lesser of (i) $61,200,000 and (ii) 40% of the lesser of (1) the purchase price of the nine Greenship Vessels, and (2) the fair market value of the Greenship Vessels. The proceeds of the Ultraco Debt Facility were used for the purpose of financing a part of the acquisition cost of the Greenship Vessels.\nOn December 29, 2017, Ultraco entered into the First Amendment to the Ultraco Debt Facility to increase the commitments for the purpose of financing the acquisition of an additional vessel by New London Eagle LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ultraco and additional guarantor under the Ultraco Debt Facility. The increase in the commitments was $8.6 million. Ultraco took delivery of the vessel in January 2018 and drew down $8.6 million. The Company paid a deposit of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company has drawn $61.2 million under the Ultraco Debt Facility.\nFor more information about the terms of the Ultraco Debt Facility and the First Amendment, see Note 8.

industry is highly competitive and fragmented with no single owner accounting for more than 5% of the on-the-water fleet. As of December 31, 2017, there are approximately 11,116 dry bulk carriers (over 10,000 dwt) totaling 817 million dwt. We compete with other (primarily private) owners of dry bulk vessels in the Handysize, Supramax, and Panamax asset classes.\nCompetition in the dry bulk trade is robust. Demand is a function of world economic conditions and the consequent requirement for commodities, production and consumption patterns, as well as events, which interrupt production, trade routes, and consumption. We compete for charters based on price, vessel location, size, age, and condition, as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator. Customers, or charterers, tend to prefer modern vessels (over older ships) due to their greater operational reliability, lower fuel consumption, and improved built-designs complying with more recent regulation standards. Consequently, owners of large modern fleets tend to have a competitive advantage over owners operating older ships.\nOur strategy is to focus on the Supramax/Ultramax asset class, which is part of the broader Handymax segment, defined as dry bulk vessels between 40,000 to 65,000 dwt. Supramax/Ultramax vessels range in size from approximately 50,000 to 65,000 dwt. These vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility offered by their on-board cranes, while the cargo carrying capacity approaches that of Panamax, which ranges in size between 72,000 and 83,000 dwt and which require onshore facilities to load and offload their cargoes. We believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the Supramax/Ultramax class makes it the preferred type of ship attractive to potential charterers. All 47 of our owned vessels, as of December 31, 2017, range in size between 50,000 and 64,000 dwt.\nThe supply of dry bulk vessels depends primarily on the level of the orderbook, the fleet age profile, and the operating efficiency of the existing fleet. As of December 2017, 8% of the world Handymax fleet was 20 years or older, while the newbuilding orderbook stood at 6.5% of the (Handymax) on-the-water fleet. The 47 vessels in our operating fleet have an average age of approximately 8.2 years as of December 31, 2017. The typical trading life of a Handymax vessel is approximately 25 years.\nThe Handymax Market\nIn 2017, drybulk global market continued to recover from a historic market low from early 2016. Trade demand grew by 4% in 2017, as compared to an increase of 1.2% in 2016. The improvement in demand was primarily driven by an increase in trades relating to iron ore, coal and grain as well as the minor bulks. On the supply side, net fleet growth (newbuilding deliveries less scrapping) amounted to 2.9% for 2017, as compared to 2.3% for the year prior. Although 2017 newbuilding deliveries decreased by 108 vessels, or 20% from the prior year, scrapping decreased by a greater amount causing net fleet growth to increase slightly year-on-year. Scrapping totaled 214 vessels in 2017, as compared to 408 in 2016, representing a drop of 48%. The Baltic Supramax Index ( BSI\u201d), a dry bulk index based on 52,000 dwt vessels, averaged $9,185 for 2017. The improvement in rates during the year was driven by increased demolition (of older vessels), lower supply growth, and higher iron ore and coal flows into China.\nLooking ahead, newbuilding deliveries for 2018 (and beyond) are expected to continue their downward trend, with the orderbook currently standing at approximately 10% of the existing fleet. Drybulk trade, which tends to be correlated to global GDP, is expected to improve by approximately 2% in 2018, driven by increased flows in iron ore, coal, grains, and minor bulks.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d or GAAP\u201d). The preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nCritical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies, because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application. For a description of all our accounting policies, see Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are generated from time charters, voyage charters and commercial pool arrangements. Time charter revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective time charter agreements as service is provided. Voyage revenues for cargo transportation are recognized ratably over the estimated relative transit time of each voyage. Voyage revenue is deemed to commence upon the completion of discharge of the previous charterer's cargo and is deemed to end upon the completion of discharge of the current cargo, provided an agreed non-cancellable charter between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue under voyage charters will not be recognized until a charter has been agreed even if the vessel has discharged its previous cargo and is proceeding to an anticipated port of loading.\nRevenues generated from time charters linked to the Baltic Supramax index and/or revenues generated from profit sharing arrangements are recognized over the term of the respective time charter agreements as service is provided and the profit sharing is fixed and determinable.\nFor the Company's vessel operating in a Commercial Pool, revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and allocated to each pool participant under a time charter agreement basis in accordance with an agreed-upon formula. The formula in the pool agreement for allocating gross shipping revenues net of voyage expenses is based on points allocated to participants' vessels based on cargo carrying capacity and other technical characteristics, such as speed and fuel consumption. We had one vessel operating in a commercial pool until April 2017.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, and shall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update provides further guidance on applying collectability criterion to assess whether the contract is valid and represents a substantive transaction on the basis whether a customer has the ability and intention to pay the promised consideration. The requirements of this standard include an increase in required disclosures. Management has not yet selected a transition method and is currently analyzing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements, including assessing changes that might be necessary to information technology systems, processes and internal controls to capture new data and address changes in financial reporting. The Company believes that the adoption of the standard will impact the timing of recognition of revenue. Management will apply the modified retrospective transition method and will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting this standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted. The Company continues to make progress in its implementation and assessment of the new revenue standard. While the assessment is still ongoing, based on the progress made to date, the Company expects that the timing of recognition of revenue for certain ongoing charter contracts will be impacted as well as the timing of recognition of certain voyage related costs. While the assessment of certain effects of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 are ongoing, the timing of recognition will primarily impact spot voyage charters. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue will be recognized from when the vessel arrives at the load port\nuntil the completion of discharge at the discharge port instead of recognizing revenue from the discharge of the previous voyage provided an agreed non-cancellable charter between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The financial impact of adoption will depend on the number of spot voyages and time charter arrangements as well as their percentage of completion at January 1, 2018. The Company expects that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will result in an increase in the opening Accumulated Deficit balance as of January 1, 2018 in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $0.5 million to $1.3 million as a result of the adjustment of Revenue and Voyage expenses. The above estimate could potentially change upon further evaluation. Additionally, the Company is currently evaluating the adjustment, if any, to other expenses such as Vessel expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the additional presentation and disclosure requirements of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is based on contracted charter parties, including spot-market related time charters for which rates fluctuate based on changes in the spot market. However, there is always the possibility of dispute over terms and payment of hires and freights. In particular, disagreements may arise as to the responsibility for third party costs incurred by the customer and revenue due to us as a result. Additionally, there are certain performance parameters included in contracted charter parties, which if not met, can result in customer claims. Accordingly, we periodically assess the recoverability of amounts outstanding and estimate a provision if there is a possibility of non-recoverability. At each balance sheet date, we provide a provision based on a review of all outstanding charter receivables. Although we believe our provisions to be reasonable at the time they are made, it is possible that an amount under dispute is not ultimately recovered and the estimated provision for doubtful accounts is inadequate.\nVessel Lives and Impairment\nThe Company estimates the useful life of the Company's vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner. In addition, the Company estimates the scrap rate to be $300 per lwt, to compute each vessel's salvage value, which is based on the 15-year average scrap value of steel.\nThe carrying values of the Company's vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of new buildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. We evaluate the carrying amounts and periods over which long-lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives. In evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long-lived assets, we review certain indicators of potential impairment, such as vessel sales and purchases, business plans and overall market conditions.\nIf indicators of impairment are present, we perform an analysis of the undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for each vessel and compare it to the vessel's carrying value. This assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available. In developing estimates of future cash flows, the Company must make assumptions about future charter rates, ship-operating expenses, and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, we utilize the rates currently in effect for the duration of their current time charters, without assuming additional profit sharing. For periods of time where our vessels are not fixed on time charters, we utilize an estimated daily time charter equivalent for our vessels' unfixed days based on a historical average of the last twenty five years of one to three years' time charters, though we consider whether using a ten or fifteen year average would result in a materially different conclusion. Actual equivalent dry bulk shipping rates are currently lower than the estimated rate. We believe current rates have been driven by short-term disruptions in demand and a slowdown in the availability of global credit. The projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the future charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days and for the unfixed days, projected FFA rates up to 2019 and an estimated daily time charter equivalent over the estimated remaining life of the vessel, assumed to be 25 years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard, reduced by brokerage commissions, expected outflows for vessels' maintenance and vessel operating expenses (including planned drydocking and special survey expenditures) and capital expenditures adjusted annually for inflation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company evaluated if any impairment indicators existed as of December 31, 2017. Based on the evaluation, the Company determined that there were impairment indicators for 22 vessels in the Company's fleet for which the vessel prices based on vessel valuations received from third party brokers were lower than their carrying values. The Company considered this to be an impairment indicator and performed an impairment test on the 22 vessels.\nOf the inputs that the Company uses for its impairment analysis, future time charter rates are the most significant and most volatile. We utilize historical averages as discussed above in our impairment tests due to the highly cyclical nature of the drybulk shipping industry. Our vessels range from very new to fifteen years old, and we believe that utilizing rates\nover a long period of time incorporates numerous shipping cycles and reflects our strategy of operating our vessels over a long time period, and in line with the overall useful economic life of our vessels. As disclosed elsewhere herein, we also consider whether utilizing ten or fifteen year averages would impact our impairment assessment. Then ten and fifteen year averages are higher than our estimate and therefore will impact our impairment test positively. Our vessels remain fully utilized and have a relatively long average remaining useful life of approximately 16.8 years in which to provide sufficient cash flows on an undiscounted basis to recover their carrying values as of December 31, 2017. Management will continue to monitor developments in charter rates in our participatory markets with respect to the expectation of future rates over an extended period.\nA comparison of the average estimated daily time charter equivalent rate used in our impairment analysis with the average break even rate at which the undiscounted cash flows for all of our vessels will be lower than their carrying value as of December 31, 2017 ( average break even rate\u201d) for our vessels is presented below:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel Class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average estimated daily time charter rate used\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage decline from\naverage estimated daily\ntime charter rate used in impairment test at which\npoint impairment would\nbe recorded\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supramax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the purpose of presenting our investors with additional information to determine how the Company's future results of operations may be impacted in the event that daily time charter rates do not improve from their current levels in future periods, we set forth in the table below analysis that shows the 1 year, 3 year, 5 year and 10 year averages blended rates and the effect of the use of each of these rates would have on the Company's impairment analysis:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Incremental\nnumber of vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential Incremental\nImpairment $ (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>15 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement does not believe that one year, three year, and five year historical average is reflective of the cyclical nature of shipping business, which tends to have cycles much longer than one, three or five years.\nBased on our impairment analysis, we determined that as of December 31, 2017, the future cash flows expected to be earned by the 22 vessels on an undiscounted basis would exceed their carrying value and therefore no impairment charges were recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as part of our fleet renewal program, management considered it probable that we would divest some of our older vessels as well as certain less efficient vessels from its fleet to achieve operating cost savings. The Company identified two groups of vessels. Group 1 vessels were selected based on the shipyard they were built and their technical specifications. The group consists of five sister ships constructed in the Dayang shipyard with 53,000 dwt. These vessels were identified by management as having poorer fuel efficiency, among other reasons, compared to their peers. The second group of 11 vessels are older than 13 years and less than 53,000 dwt. Based on our projected undiscounted cash flows prior to sale, factoring the probability of sale, such vessels were determined to be impaired, and written down to their current fair value as of December 31, 2016, which was determined by obtaining broker quotes from two unaffiliated shipbrokers. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $122,860,600 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The carrying value of these vessels prior to impairment was $234,860,600. In addition to the above, in 2015, we identified six vessels as probable sales, and recognized an impairment charge in 2015 of $50,872,734. As the value of such vessels further declined in the first quarter of 2016, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $6,167,262 in that quarter. Out of the six vessels initially identified in 2015, all vessels have been sold as of December 31, 2017. Out of the sixteen vessels impaired in 2016, two vessels were sold during 2017 and a memorandum of sale agreement was signed on the third one. The Company expects to deliver the vessel to the buyers in the second quarter of 2018.\nAlthough management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective. Charter rates may remain at depressed levels for some time, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, and future assessments of vessel impairment. In the event that any future impairment were to occur, we would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations performed on an individual vessel basis. Such valuations are not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale, which may be more or less, and should not be relied upon as such.\nThe table set forth below indicates the carrying value of each of our vessels as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, which we believe, based on broker quotes recently obtained, have a basic charter free market value below its carrying value. Noted below the table is the aggregate difference between the carrying value and the basic market value, which represents the approximate amount by which we believe we would have to reduce our net income if we sold all of such vessels, excluding commissions, as of December 31, 2017, on industry standard terms, in cash transactions, and to a willing buyer where we are not under any compulsion to sell, and where the buyer is not under any compulsion to buy. Additionally, given the current dynamic in the dry bulk market, were we to sell a vessel, we might not be able to realize proceeds consistent with the amounts disclosed below.\nTable 153:

We believe that the aggregate carrying value of these vessels exceed their December 31, 2017 and 2016 aggregate basic charter-free market value by approximately $122 million and $180 million, respectively.\nDeferred Drydock Cost\nThere are two methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings: (a) the deferral method where drydock costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period to the next scheduled drydock; and (b) expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred. We use the deferral method of accounting for drydock expenses. Under the deferral method, drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis until the next drydock, which we estimate to be a period of two to five years. We believe the deferral method better matches costs with revenue than expensing the costs as incurred. We use judgment when estimating the period between drydock performed, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessels in the period when contracted. We expect that our vessels will be required to be drydocked approximately every 30 months for vessels older than 15 years and 60 months for vessels younger than 15 years.\nCosts deferred as part of the drydocking include direct costs that are incurred as part of the drydocking to meet regulatory requirements. During drydocking, we capitalize into the cost basis of the vessel any expenditures that add economic life to the vessel, increase the vessel's earnings capacity or improve the vessel's efficiency. Expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs, whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not, are expensed as incurred. Unamortized drydocking costs are written off as drydocking expense if the vessels are drydocked earlier than the applicable amortization period.\nVessel Acquisitions\nWhere we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel, we record all identified tangible and intangible assets or liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to market data and the amount of expected future cash flows. We value any asset or liability arising from the market value of the time charters assumed when an acquired vessel is delivered to us.\nWhere we have assumed an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are less than market charter rates, we record a liability in fair value below contract value of time charters acquired based on the difference between the assumed charter rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent vessel. Conversely, where we assume an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are above market charter rates, we record an asset in fair value above contract value of time charters acquired, based on the difference between the market charter rate and the contracted charter rate for an equivalent vessel. This determination is made at the time the vessel is delivered to us, and such assets and liabilities are amortized to revenue over the remaining period of the charter. The determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates of many variables including market charter rates, expected future charter rates, future vessel operation expenses, the level of utilization of our vessels and our weighted average cost of capital. The use of different assumptions could result in a material change in the fair value of these items, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In the event that the market charter rates relating to the acquired vessels are lower than the contracted charter rates at the time of their respective deliveries to us, our net earnings for the remainder of the terms of the charters may be adversely affected although our cash flows will not be so affected.\nResults of Operations for years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nThe following tables represent the operating data and certain financial statement data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 on a consolidated basis.\nWe believe that the important measures for analyzing future trends in our results of operations consist of the following:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ownership Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chartered-in Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fleet Utilization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ownership days: We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us.

Our fleet continues to perform at very high utilization rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTime Charter and Voyage Revenue\nShipping revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by a company and the trades in which those vessels operate. In the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry, rates for the transportation of dry bulk cargoes such as ores, grains, steel, fertilizers, and similar commodities, are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for such commodities, the distance that cargoes must be transported, and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported. The demand for shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy and in discrete geographical areas. The number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service, principally because of scrapping.\nThe mix of charters between spot or voyage charters and mid-term time charters also affects revenues. Because the mix between voyage charters and time charters significantly affects shipping revenues and voyage expenses, vessel revenues are benchmarked based on net charter hire income. Net charter hire income comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters, and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating on voyage charters in the spot market and charter hire expenses. Net charter hire serves as a measure of analyzing fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue.\nThe following table represents the reconciliation of Net charter hire income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,784,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,492,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,856,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voyage Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,351,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,093,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,832,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charter hire expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,283,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,845,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,125,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charter hire revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,149,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,553,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,898,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of Net charter hire from\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time charter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voyage charter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial pool\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur economic decisions are based on anticipated Net charter hire rates and we evaluate financial performance based on Net charter rates achieved. Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of days during which our vessels operate and the net charter hire that our vessels earn under charters, which, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the duration of our charters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintenance and upgrade work;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the age, condition and specifications of our vessels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>levels of supply and demand in the dry bulk shipping industry; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other factors affecting spot market charter rates for dry bulk carriers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were earned from time charters, voyage charters and vessel pools. As is common in the shipping industry, we pay commissions ranging from 1.25% to 5% of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers and in-house brokers associated with the charterers, depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the charter.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $236,784,625, an increase of 90% compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in charter hire rates attributable to an improvement in the dry bulk market and increase in available days. The increase in available days was due to the acquisition of 10 Ultramax vessels and an increase in chartered-in days offset by the sale of four vessels during 2017. The chartered-in days for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 3,353 compared to 1,494 in the prior year.\nNet revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $124,492,844 and $103,856,876, respectively. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 20% higher than net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the increase in the number of freight voyages performed and increase in available days. The charter rates year over year have remained flat. The increase in available days was due to the charter-in of vessels and the delivery of a 2016 built Ultramax 61,530 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016 offset by the sale of four vessels during 2016. Our fleet utilization increased from 97.6% during 2015 to 98.7% during 2016.\nVoyage Expenses\nTo the extent that we employ our vessels on voyage charters, we incur expenses that include bunkers, port charges, canal tolls, cargo handling operations and brokerage commissions, as these expenses are borne by the vessel owner on voyage charters. Bunkers, port charges, and canal toll expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters.\nVoyage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $62,351,252, compared with $42,093,714 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Voyage expenses have primarily increased due to an increase in bunker prices as well as an increased number of freight voyages performed in the current year compared to the prior year.\nVoyage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $42,093,714, compared with $23,832,457 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Voyage expenses have primarily increased due to an increase in bunker prices as well as an increased number of freight voyages performed in 2016 compared to 2015.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses include expenses relating to crewing costs, vessel operations, general vessel maintenance, regulatory and classification society compliance, repairs, stores, supplies, spare parts and technical consultants.\nVessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $78,607,244, which represents an increase of $4,590,481, compared with $74,016,763 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in vessel expenses is attributable to the increase in the owned fleet due to the purchase of 10 Ultramax vessels offset by the sale of four vessels during 2017 and four vessels during 2016. The ownership days for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 16,293 compared to 15,408 for the prior year ended December 31, 2016.\nVessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $74,016,763, which represents a decrease of $12,312,297 compared with $86,329,060 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower vessel expenses are attributable to the efficiencies achieved through in-house technical management of vessels as well as sale of the Falcon, Harrier, Peregrine and Kittiwake during 2016, and the sale of the Kite during 2015 offset by the purchase of a 2016 built Ultramax 61,530 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe believe daily vessel operating expenses are a good measure for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation.\nAverage daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4,825 compared to $4,803 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet decreased by $530 per day to $4,803 during 2016 as compared to $5,334 in 2015. The decrease in daily vessel operating expenses was primarily due to lower vessel insurance and cost of lubes.\nInsurance expense varies with overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured's loss record, level of insurance and desired coverage. The main insurance expenses include hull and machinery insurance (i.e. asset insurance) costs, Protection, and Indemnity (\"P & I\") insurance (i.e. liability insurance) costs. Certain other insurances, such as basic war risk premiums based on voyages into designated war risk areas are often for the account of the charterers for time charter voyages and on owners' account for voyage charters.\nOur vessel expenses, which generally represent costs under the vessel operating budgets, cost of insurance and vessel registry and other regulatory fees, will increase with the enlargement of our fleet. Other factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the shipping industry in general, may also cause these expenses to increase, including, for instance, developments relating to market prices for crew, insurance and petroleum-based lubricants and supplies.\nCharter Hire Expense\nThe charter hire expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $31,283,956 compared to $12,845,468 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in charter hire expenses in 2017 compared with 2016 was mainly due to an increase in short term chartered-in vessels resulting from successful implementation of our business strategy. The chartered-in operating days for 2017 were 3,353 compared to 1,494 in 2016. The Company currently charters in one vessel on a long term basis.\nThe charter hire expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $12,845,468 compared to $4,125,766 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in charter hire expense in 2016 compared with 2015 was principally the result of the delivery of a 63,000 dwt new building vessel in May 2016 for a period of nine to fourteen months and a 61,000 dwt new building vessel that was delivered in July 2016 for a period of eleven to thirteen months. In addition, the Company chartered in vessels on a short-term basis as needed. The total charter in days for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 1,494, compared to 382, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel. Depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner. On October 15, 2014, as part of fresh-start reporting, we revalued our vessels, which resulted in a decrease in vessel assets and drydocking assets. We estimate the scrap rate to be $300/lwt to compute each vessel's salvage value.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $33,690,686 and $38,884,322, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a lower depreciation base after the impairment write down of $122.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale of four vessels during 2017 and five vessels during 2016 offset by the purchase of ten Ultramax vessels during 2017 and one Ultramax vessel during the fourth quarter of 2016. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $29,354,017 of depreciation and $4,336,669 of deferred drydocking amortization. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $35,556,911 of depreciation and $3,327,411 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $38,884,322, which represents a decrease of $4,116,419 compared with $43,000,741 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was substantially due to the operation of a smaller fleet resulting from the sale of four vessels in 2016, impairment of six vessels in 2015 reducing the depreciation base and sale of one vessel in 2015 offset by an increase in drydock amortization and the addition of a 2016 built Ultramax 62,350 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $35,556,911 of depreciation and $3,327,411 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs. Total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $41,044,397 of depreciation and $1,956,344 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs.\nDrydocking relates to our regularly scheduled maintenance program necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years for vessels older than 15 years and every five years for vessels younger than 15 years, accordingly, these expenses are deferred and amortized over that period.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses include onshore vessel administration related expenses such as technical management, legal and professional expenses and recurring administrative and other expenses including payroll and expenses relating to our executive officers and office staff, office rent and expenses, directors fees, and directors and officers insurance. General and administrative expenses also include stock-based compensation expenses.\nWe historically entered into technical management agreements for some of our vessels with independent technical managers. On August 24, 2015, the Company provided three months' notice to V. Ships Limited to terminate the technical management contract. The Company completed the transfer of all vessels to in-house technical management during the first quarter of 2016. The technical management fees of $229,062 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $6,110,489 for the year ended December 31, 2015 are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $33,126,310 and $22,905,802, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses due to additional stock grants in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017 and compensation expense due to increased head count. The higher General and administrative expenses are reflective of the expansion of our operating platform.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $22,905,802 and $25,537,007, respectively. The decrease in General and administrative expenses in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower\noffice lease expense, advisors' fees, stock-based compensation expenses and third party technical manager fees offset by lower third party management fees received due to the cancellation of the management agreement with Delphin Shipping LLC.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation charges of $8,738,615 and $2,206,690, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. These stock-based compensation charges relate to the stock options and restricted stock units granted to members of management and certain directors of the Company under the 2014 Plan and the 2016 Plan (see Note 13 Stock Incentive Plans\u201d in the consolidated financial statements).\nInterest and Finance Costs\nInterest Expense consisted of:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Lien Facility / Exit Financing Facility Interest *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,305,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,938,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,781,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,927,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,532,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,146,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment-in-Kind interest on Second Lien Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,098,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,327,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultraco Debt Facility Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Norwegian Bond Debt interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,558,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New First Lien Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility - commitment fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,376,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,799,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,927,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* The Exit Financing Facility was amended and restated on March 30, 2016 as a result of entering into the First Lien Facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, interest rates on our outstanding debt under First Lien Facility ranged from 4.77% to 5.35%, including a margin over LIBOR and commitment fees of 40% of the margin on the undrawn portion of the facility. The weighted average effective interest rate was 6.18%.

The weighted average effective interest rate was 5.21%.\nFor 2016, interest rates on our outstanding debt ranged from 3.86% to 4.99%, including a margin over LIBOR applicable under the terms of the First Lien Facility. The weighted average effective interest rate, including the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs for this period was 6.83%.\nFor 2015, interest rates on our outstanding debt ranged from 3.696% to 4.08%, including a margin over LIBOR applicable under the terms of the First Lien Facility. The weighted average effective interest rate including the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs for this period was 5.06%.\nForward freight agreements\nThe Company trades in FFAs and bunkers swaps, with the objective of utilizing this market as economic hedging instruments that reduce the risk of specific vessels to changes in the freight market. The Company's FFAs and bunker swaps have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment. As such, unrealized and realized gains are recognized as a component of other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe effect of non-designated derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives not\ndesignated as hedging\ninstruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location of gain/(loss)\nrecognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFAs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other income/(expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(284,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(541,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bunker Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other income/(expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>413,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other income/(expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(561,495\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\n</td> <td>Balance Sheet location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair value of Derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFAs - Unrealized loss\n</td> <td>Fair value of Derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(73,170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bunker Swaps - Unrealized gain\n</td> <td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Collateral Disclosures\nThe Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives by the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral.

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company posted cash collateral related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $178,836 and zero, respectively, which is recorded within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nLoss on extinguishment\nOn December 8, 2017, the Company paid outstanding debt of approximately $265.0 million under the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility through the New First Lien Facility of $65.0 million and issuance of $200.0 million Senior Secured Bonds. As a result, the Company recognized a $15.0 million loss on debt extinguishment in the fourth quarter of 2017. Please see \"Note 8. Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe Company does not believe that inflation has had or is likely, in the near future, to have a significant impact on vessel operating expenses, drydocking expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents the cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,434\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,787\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) / provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(155,250\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) / increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,079\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7,388,971, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $45,434,310 in 2016. The increase in cash flow provided by operations resulted from an increase in the charter hire rates achieved by the Company coupled with an improving dry bulk market offset by negative working capital changes as an increasing percentage of our revenue is earned on voyage charters as opposed to time charters.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $45,434,310, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $43,786,769 in 2015. The increase in cash flow used in operations resulted from negative working capital changes offset by lower drydock expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $155,249,639, compared to $9,280,391 in the prior year. During 2017, the Company purchased ten Ultramax vessels for $174.4 million and advance on purchase of one Ultramax vessel of $2.2 million partially offset by the proceeds from sale of four vessels for $26.0 million. Please refer to \"Note 4.Vessels\" to the consolidated financial statements. During 2017, the Company purchased a certificate of deposit maturing in one year of $4.5 million. During 2016, the Company purchased a 2016 built Ultramax for $18.9 million. In addition, the Company paid $1.9 million as an advance payment for the acquisition of a 2017 built Ultramax. The Company sold four vessels during 2016 for net proceeds of $13.0 million during the year. In 2015, the Company received $7.8 million from the sale of its investment in Korea Line Corporation and $4.2 million from sale of one vessel (the Kite).\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $127,595,602, compared to $106,334,650 in the prior year ended December 31, 2016. The Company received net proceeds of $96.0 million in the December Private Placement, which closed on January 20, 2017 and repaid $13.0 million of its term loan under the First Lien Facility from the proceeds of the sale of the vessels Redwing, Sparrow, Woodstar and Wren. Additionally, the Company completed a refinancing of approximately $191.0 million under the First Lien Facility and $77.4 million under the Second Lien Facility through the New First Lien Facility of $65.0 million and issuance of $200.0 million Senior Secured Bonds issued at a discount of $1.9 million. The Company received $61.2 million from the Ultraco Debt Facility in the second quarter of 2017 and paid $0.9 million to the lender. The Company paid $0.9 million to the lenders of the New First Lien Facility as part of the debt refinancing transaction. The Company also paid $5.2 million in other financing costs in connection with the refinancing transaction. Please see \"Note 8. Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2016, the Company received net proceeds of $85.7 million from a private common stock placement, which closed on August 10, 2016, $60.0 million received from our Second Lien Loan Facility and $15.2 million from the revolver under the First Lien Facility offset by repayment of $21.3 million of our term loan and $30.2 million of our revolver each under the First Lien Facility. The Company also paid $3.1 million in deferred financing costs.\nDuring 2015, we borrowed $40,000,000 from our revolving credit facility under the Exit Financing Facility and repaid $19,625,000 toward the term loan facility under the Exit Financing Facility. In August 2015, we also paid $500,000 to our lenders to amend our Exit Financing Facility and $1,419,228 to settle taxes on net share equity awards.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $56,251,044 compared to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $76,516,110 at December 31, 2016. In addition, our restricted cash balance includes $74,917 for collateralizing letters of credit relating to our office leases as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's debt consisted of $200,000,000 in senior secured bonds, net of $6,049,671 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the Norwegian Bond Debt, $65,000,000 in term loan and revolver, net of $1,241,815 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the New First Lien Facility and $61,200,000, net of $1,224,838 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the Ultraco Debt Facility. In addition, we have $15 million in undrawn revolver available under the Super Senior Facility.\nOur principal sources of funds are operating cash flows, long-term bank borrowings and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our principal use of funds is capital expenditures to establish and grow our fleet, maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, fund working capital requirements and repayments of interest on our outstanding loan facilities. See -Overview-Norwegian Bond Debt\u201d and -Overview-New First Lien Facility and \"-Overview-Ultraco Debt Facility\" for additional information concerning our loan facilities and other debt.\nWe believe that our current financial resources, together with the undrawn revolver under the Super Senior Facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing business needs and other obligations over the next twelve months. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control including, among other things, continuing to improve the profitability of its operations and future cash flows, which contemplates an improvement in charter rates.\nDividends\nThe Company did not make any dividend payments in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In the future, the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will always be subject to the discretion of the board of directors, restrictions contained in the Norwegian Bond Debt terms, the New First Lien Facility and the Ultraco Debt Facility, and the requirements of Marshall Islands law. The timing and amount of any dividends declared will depend on, among other things, the Company's earnings, financial condition and cash requirements and availability, the ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by the Company's growth strategy, the terms of its outstanding indebtedness and the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. The Company does not currently expect to pay dividends in the near term.\nDebt Agreements\nRefer to Note 8 Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements above for a summary of our credit agreements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our expected contractual obligations and their maturity dates as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Within\nOne\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to\nThree\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank Loans(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and borrowing fees(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Norwegian Bond Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chartering agreement (2,3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel acquisition (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>462,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See Note 8. \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company paid a deposit of $2.2 million for the purchase of the vessel. The Company increased its draw down under the Ultraco Debt Facility by $8.6 million in connection with the acquisition.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures relate to the purchase of vessels and capital improvements to our vessels, which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels.\nIn addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, the Company's other major capital expenditures include funding the Company's program of regularly scheduled drydocking necessary to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Although the Company has some flexibility regarding the timing of its drydocking, the costs are relatively predictable. Management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years for vessels older than 15 years and five years for vessels younger than 15 years. Funding of these requirements is anticipated to be met with cash from operations. We anticipate that this process of recertification will require us to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities, which will reduce our available days and operating days during that period.\nDrydocking costs incurred are deferred and amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the period through the date of the next scheduled drydocking for those vessels. In 2017, three of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $2,579,111 in drydocking related costs. In 2016, nine of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $3,688,711 in drydocking related costs. In 2015, nineteen of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $11,141,561 in drydocking related costs.\nThe following table represents certain information about the estimated costs for anticipated vessel drydockings in the next four quarters, along with the anticipated off-hire days:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ending\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Off-hire Days(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected Costs(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.95 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.95 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.60 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.30 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Actual duration of drydocking will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed.\nContracted Time Charter Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have time charter contracts currently for all our vessels in the operating fleet.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d our consolidated financial data set forth in Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the risk factors identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\nGeneral Overview\nWe are Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc., a Marshall Islands corporation incorporated on March 23, 2005 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. We own one of the largest fleets of Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk vessels in the world. Supramax/Ultramax vessels dry bulk are vessels which are constructed with on-board cranes, ranging in size from approximately 50,000 to 59,000 dwt and Ultramax dry bulk vessels range in size from 60,000 to 65,000 dwt. They are considered a sub-category of the Handymax segment typically defined as 40,000 to 65,000 dwt. We transport a broad range of major and minor bulk cargoes, including but not limited to coal, grain, ore, petcoke, cement and fertilizer, along worldwide shipping routes. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated a modern fleet of 47 Handymax dry bulk vessels. We chartered-in a 61,400 dwt, 2013 built newbuilding Japanese vessel for approximately four years. In addition, the Company charters-in third-party vessels on a short to medium term basis.\nWe are focused on maintaining a high quality fleet that is concentrated primarily in Supramax/ Ultramax dry bulk carriers. These vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on-board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of Panamax dry bulk vessels, which range in size from 72,000 to 83,000 dwt and rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes. We believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the Supramax class vessels make them attractive to cargo interests and vessel charterers. The 47 vessels in our operating fleet, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 2,683,751 dwt, have an average age of 8.2 years as of December 31, 2017.\nRefinancing\nOn December 8, 2017, the Company, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, completed a refinancing of approximately $265,000,000 under (i) the First Lien Facility and (ii) the Second Lien Facility, through (a) the New First Lien Facility of $65,000,000, and (b) the issuance by Shipco, the Norwegian Bond Debt of $200,000,000. In addition, Shipco entered into the Super Senior Facility of $15,000,000. For more information about the terms of the New First Lien Facility, the Norwegian Bank Debt and the Super Senior Facility, see Note 8. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nCorporate Reorganization\nIn connection with the refinancing transactions, the Company consummated an internal reorganization. As part of the internal reorganization, Eagle Shipping transferred ownership of certain wholly-owned vessel-owning subsidiaries to Shipco, such that Shipco became the parent to 28 vessel-owning subsidiaries. Additionally, all management and technical services will now be conducted under Eagle Bulk Management LLC, a newly-formed limited liability company existing under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nUltraco Debt Facility\nOn June 28, 2017, Ultraco entered into the Ultraco Debt Facility, which provided for a multi-draw senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to the lesser of (i) $61,200,000 and (ii) 40% of the lesser of (1) the purchase price of the nine Greenship Vessels, and (2) the fair market value of the Greenship Vessels. The proceeds of the Ultraco Debt Facility were used for the purpose of financing a part of the acquisition cost of the Greenship Vessels.\nOn December 29, 2017, Ultraco entered into the First Amendment to the Ultraco Debt Facility to increase the commitments for the purpose of financing the acquisition of an additional vessel by New London Eagle LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ultraco and additional guarantor under the Ultraco Debt Facility. The increase in the commitments was $8.6 million. Ultraco took delivery of the vessel in January 2018 and drew down $8.6 million. The Company paid a deposit of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company has drawn $61.2 million under the Ultraco Debt Facility.\nFor more information about the terms of the Ultraco Debt Facility and the First Amendment, see Note 8. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following are certain significant events with respect to our vessels that occurred during 2016 and 2017:\n \u2022 On April 26, 2016, the Company sold the vessel Peregrine for $2.6 million, after brokerage commissions and associated selling expenses, and recorded a net loss of approximately $150,000 in the second quarter of 2016.

The vessel is expected to be delivered to the buyers in the second quarter of 2018. The Company expects to recognize a gain of $0.3 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company reported the carrying amount of the vessel as vessel held for sale in its consolidated balance sheet. \n \u2022 On December 19. 2017, the Company, through Ultraco, signed a memorandum of agreement to acquire a 2015 built 64,000 dwt CROWN-83 Ultramax dry bulk vessel constructed at Chengxi Shipyard Co., Ltd for $21.2 million. The Company took delivery of the vessel, the New London Eagle, on January 9, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the Company paid a deposit of $2.2 million for the purchase of the vessel. \nThe following are certain significant events with respect to our vessels that occurred during 2015:\n \u2022 In April 2015, the Company decided to sell the Kite, a 1997-built Handymax, and reached an agreement to sell the vessel for $4.3 million after brokerage commissions payable to a third party. On May 7, 2015, the Company sold the vessel and realized a net loss of approximately $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. \n \u2022 On May 20, 2015, the Company delivered a 90 day termination notice to Navig8 Pool to terminate the pool arrangements for all of its vessels in the Navig8 Pool. The notice of termination was given pursuant to the terms of the Company's pool agreement. \n \u2022 On August 24, 2015, the Company provided three months' notice to V. Ships Limited to terminate the technical management contract. The Company completed the transfer of all vessels to in-house technical management during the first quarter of 2016. \nBusiness Strategy and Outlook:\nWe believe our strong balance sheet allows us the flexibility to opportunistically make investments in the dry bulk segment that will drive shareholder growth. In order to accomplish this, we intend to:\n \u2022 Maintain a highly efficient and the high quality fleet in the dry bulk segment. \n \u2022 Maintain a revenue strategy that takes advantage of a rising rate environment and at the same time mitigate risk in a declining rate environment. \n \u2022 Maintain a cost structure that allow us to be competitive in all economic cycles without sacrificing safety and maintenance. \n \u2022 Continue to grow our relationships with our charterers and vendors \n \u2022 Continue to invest in our on-shore operations and development of processes. \nOur financial performance is based on the following key elements of our business strategy:\n (1) concentration in one vessel category: Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk vessels, which we believe offer certain size, operational and geographical advantages relative to other classes of dry bulk vessels, such as Handymax, Panamax and Capesize vessels, \n (2) An active owner-operator model where we seek to operate our own fleet and develop contractual relationships directly with cargo interests. These relationships and the related cargo contracts have the dual benefit of providing greater operational efficiencies and act as a balance to the Company's naturally long position to the market. Notwithstanding the focus on voyage chartering, we consistently monitor the dry bulk shipping market and, based on market conditions, will consider taking advantage of long-term time charters at higher rates when appropriate. \n (3) Maintain high quality vessels and improve standards of operation through improved standards and procedures, crew training and repair and maintenance procedures. \nWe have employed all of our vessels on time and voyage charters. The following table represents certain information about our revenue earning charters on our operating fleet as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

As of December 31, 2017, there are approximately 11,116 dry bulk carriers (over 10,000 dwt) totaling 817 million dwt. We compete with other (primarily private) owners of dry bulk vessels in the Handysize, Supramax, and Panamax asset classes.\nCompetition in the dry bulk trade is robust. Demand is a function of world economic conditions and the consequent requirement for commodities, production and consumption patterns, as well as events, which interrupt production, trade routes, and consumption. We compete for charters based on price, vessel location, size, age, and condition, as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator. Customers, or charterers, tend to prefer modern vessels (over older ships) due to their greater operational reliability, lower fuel consumption, and improved built-designs complying with more recent regulation standards. Consequently, owners of large modern fleets tend to have a competitive advantage over owners operating older ships.\nOur strategy is to focus on the Supramax/Ultramax asset class, which is part of the broader Handymax segment, defined as dry bulk vessels between 40,000 to 65,000 dwt. Supramax/Ultramax vessels range in size from approximately 50,000 to 65,000 dwt. These vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility offered by their on-board cranes, while the cargo carrying capacity approaches that of Panamax, which ranges in size between 72,000 and 83,000 dwt and which require onshore facilities to load and offload their cargoes. We believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the Supramax/Ultramax class makes it the preferred type of ship attractive to potential charterers. All 47 of our owned vessels, as of December 31, 2017, range in size between 50,000 and 64,000 dwt.\nThe supply of dry bulk vessels depends primarily on the level of the orderbook, the fleet age profile, and the operating efficiency of the existing fleet. As of December 2017, 8% of the world Handymax fleet was 20 years or older, while the newbuilding orderbook stood at 6.5% of the (Handymax) on-the-water fleet. The 47 vessels in our operating fleet have an average age of approximately 8.2 years as of December 31, 2017. The typical trading life of a Handymax vessel is approximately 25 years.\nThe Handymax Market\nIn 2017, drybulk global market continued to recover from a historic market low from early 2016. Trade demand grew by 4% in 2017, as compared to an increase of 1.2% in 2016. The improvement in demand was primarily driven by an increase in trades relating to iron ore, coal and grain as well as the minor bulks. On the supply side, net fleet growth (newbuilding deliveries less scrapping) amounted to 2.9% for 2017, as compared to 2.3% for the year prior. Although 2017 newbuilding deliveries decreased by 108 vessels, or 20% from the prior year, scrapping decreased by a greater amount causing net fleet growth to increase slightly year-on-year. Scrapping totaled 214 vessels in 2017, as compared to 408 in 2016, representing a drop of 48%. The Baltic Supramax Index ( BSI\u201d), a dry bulk index based on 52,000 dwt vessels, averaged $9,185 for 2017. The improvement in rates during the year was driven by increased demolition (of older vessels), lower supply growth, and higher iron ore and coal flows into China.\nLooking ahead, newbuilding deliveries for 2018 (and beyond) are expected to continue their downward trend, with the orderbook currently standing at approximately 10% of the existing fleet. Drybulk trade, which tends to be correlated to global GDP, is expected to improve by approximately 2% in 2018, driven by increased flows in iron ore, coal, grains, and minor bulks.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d or GAAP\u201d). The preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nCritical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies, because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application. For a description of all our accounting policies, see Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are generated from time charters, voyage charters and commercial pool arrangements. Time charter revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective time charter agreements as service is provided. Voyage revenues for cargo transportation are recognized ratably over the estimated relative transit time of each voyage. Voyage revenue is deemed to commence upon the completion of discharge of the previous charterer's cargo and is deemed to end upon the completion of discharge of the current cargo, provided an agreed non-cancellable charter between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue under voyage charters will not be recognized until a charter has been agreed even if the vessel has discharged its previous cargo and is proceeding to an anticipated port of loading.\nRevenues generated from time charters linked to the Baltic Supramax index and/or revenues generated from profit sharing arrangements are recognized over the term of the respective time charter agreements as service is provided and the profit sharing is fixed and determinable.\nFor the Company's vessel operating in a Commercial Pool, revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and allocated to each pool participant under a time charter agreement basis in accordance with an agreed-upon formula. The formula in the pool agreement for allocating gross shipping revenues net of voyage expenses is based on points allocated to participants' vessels based on cargo carrying capacity and other technical characteristics, such as speed and fuel consumption. We had one vessel operating in a commercial pool until April 2017.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, and shall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update provides further guidance on applying collectability criterion to assess whether the contract is valid and represents a substantive transaction on the basis whether a customer has the ability and intention to pay the promised consideration. The requirements of this standard include an increase in required disclosures. Management has not yet selected a transition method and is currently analyzing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements, including assessing changes that might be necessary to information technology systems, processes and internal controls to capture new data and address changes in financial reporting. The Company believes that the adoption of the standard will impact the timing of recognition of revenue. Management will apply the modified retrospective transition method and will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting this standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted. The Company continues to make progress in its implementation and assessment of the new revenue standard. While the assessment is still ongoing, based on the progress made to date, the Company expects that the timing of recognition of revenue for certain ongoing charter contracts will be impacted as well as the timing of recognition of certain voyage related costs. While the assessment of certain effects of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 are ongoing, the timing of recognition will primarily impact spot voyage charters. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue will be recognized from when the vessel arrives at the load port\nuntil the completion of discharge at the discharge port instead of recognizing revenue from the discharge of the previous voyage provided an agreed non-cancellable charter between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The financial impact of adoption will depend on the number of spot voyages and time charter arrangements as well as their percentage of completion at January 1, 2018. The Company expects that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will result in an increase in the opening Accumulated Deficit balance as of January 1, 2018 in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $0.5 million to $1.3 million as a result of the adjustment of Revenue and Voyage expenses. The above estimate could potentially change upon further evaluation. Additionally, the Company is currently evaluating the adjustment, if any, to other expenses such as Vessel expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the additional presentation and disclosure requirements of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is based on contracted charter parties, including spot-market related time charters for which rates fluctuate based on changes in the spot market. However, there is always the possibility of dispute over terms and payment of hires and freights. In particular, disagreements may arise as to the responsibility for third party costs incurred by the customer and revenue due to us as a result. Additionally, there are certain performance parameters included in contracted charter parties, which if not met, can result in customer claims. Accordingly, we periodically assess the recoverability of amounts outstanding and estimate a provision if there is a possibility of non-recoverability. At each balance sheet date, we provide a provision based on a review of all outstanding charter receivables. Although we believe our provisions to be reasonable at the time they are made, it is possible that an amount under dispute is not ultimately recovered and the estimated provision for doubtful accounts is inadequate.\nVessel Lives and Impairment\nThe Company estimates the useful life of the Company's vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner. In addition, the Company estimates the scrap rate to be $300 per lwt, to compute each vessel's salvage value, which is based on the 15-year average scrap value of steel.\nThe carrying values of the Company's vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of new buildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. We evaluate the carrying amounts and periods over which long-lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives. In evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long-lived assets, we review certain indicators of potential impairment, such as vessel sales and purchases, business plans and overall market conditions.\nIf indicators of impairment are present, we perform an analysis of the undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for each vessel and compare it to the vessel's carrying value. This assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available. In developing estimates of future cash flows, the Company must make assumptions about future charter rates, ship-operating expenses, and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, we utilize the rates currently in effect for the duration of their current time charters, without assuming additional profit sharing. For periods of time where our vessels are not fixed on time charters, we utilize an estimated daily time charter equivalent for our vessels' unfixed days based on a historical average of the last twenty five years of one to three years' time charters, though we consider whether using a ten or fifteen year average would result in a materially different conclusion. Actual equivalent dry bulk shipping rates are currently lower than the estimated rate. We believe current rates have been driven by short-term disruptions in demand and a slowdown in the availability of global credit. The projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the future charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days and for the unfixed days, projected FFA rates up to 2019 and an estimated daily time charter equivalent over the estimated remaining life of the vessel, assumed to be 25 years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard, reduced by brokerage commissions, expected outflows for vessels' maintenance and vessel operating expenses (including planned drydocking and special survey expenditures) and capital expenditures adjusted annually for inflation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company evaluated if any impairment indicators existed as of December 31, 2017. Based on the evaluation, the Company determined that there were impairment indicators for 22 vessels in the Company's fleet for which the vessel prices based on vessel valuations received from third party brokers were lower than their carrying values. The Company considered this to be an impairment indicator and performed an impairment test on the 22 vessels.\nOf the inputs that the Company uses for its impairment analysis, future time charter rates are the most significant and most volatile. We utilize historical averages as discussed above in our impairment tests due to the highly cyclical nature of the drybulk shipping industry. Our vessels range from very new to fifteen years old, and we believe that utilizing rates\nover a long period of time incorporates numerous shipping cycles and reflects our strategy of operating our vessels over a long time period, and in line with the overall useful economic life of our vessels. As disclosed elsewhere herein, we also consider whether utilizing ten or fifteen year averages would impact our impairment assessment. Then ten and fifteen year averages are higher than our estimate and therefore will impact our impairment test positively. Our vessels remain fully utilized and have a relatively long average remaining useful life of approximately 16.8 years in which to provide sufficient cash flows on an undiscounted basis to recover their carrying values as of December 31, 2017. Management will continue to monitor developments in charter rates in our participatory markets with respect to the expectation of future rates over an extended period.\nA comparison of the average estimated daily time charter equivalent rate used in our impairment analysis with the average break even rate at which the undiscounted cash flows for all of our vessels will be lower than their carrying value as of December 31, 2017 ( average break even rate\u201d) for our vessels is presented below:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel Class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average estimated daily time charter rate used\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage decline from\naverage estimated daily\ntime charter rate used in impairment test at which\npoint impairment would\nbe recorded\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supramax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the purpose of presenting our investors with additional information to determine how the Company's future results of operations may be impacted in the event that daily time charter rates do not improve from their current levels in future periods, we set forth in the table below analysis that shows the 1 year, 3 year, 5 year and 10 year averages blended rates and the effect of the use of each of these rates would have on the Company's impairment analysis:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Incremental\nnumber of vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential Incremental\nImpairment $ (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>15 year historical average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement does not believe that one year, three year, and five year historical average is reflective of the cyclical nature of shipping business, which tends to have cycles much longer than one, three or five years.\nBased on our impairment analysis, we determined that as of December 31, 2017, the future cash flows expected to be earned by the 22 vessels on an undiscounted basis would exceed their carrying value and therefore no impairment charges were recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as part of our fleet renewal program, management considered it probable that we would divest some of our older vessels as well as certain less efficient vessels from its fleet to achieve operating cost savings. The Company identified two groups of vessels. Group 1 vessels were selected based on the shipyard they were built and their technical specifications. The group consists of five sister ships constructed in the Dayang shipyard with 53,000 dwt. These vessels were identified by management as having poorer fuel efficiency, among other reasons, compared to their peers. The second group of 11 vessels are older than 13 years and less than 53,000 dwt. Based on our projected undiscounted cash flows prior to sale, factoring the probability of sale, such vessels were determined to be impaired, and written down to their current fair value as of December 31, 2016, which was determined by obtaining broker quotes from two unaffiliated shipbrokers. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $122,860,600 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The carrying value of these vessels prior to impairment was $234,860,600. In addition to the above, in 2015, we identified six vessels as probable sales, and recognized an impairment charge in 2015 of $50,872,734. As the value of such vessels further declined in the first quarter of 2016, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $6,167,262 in that quarter. Out of the six vessels initially identified in 2015, all vessels have been sold as of December 31, 2017. Out of the sixteen vessels impaired in 2016, two vessels were sold during 2017 and a memorandum of sale agreement was signed on the third one. The Company expects to deliver the vessel to the buyers in the second quarter of 2018.\nAlthough management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective. Charter rates may remain at depressed levels for some time, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, and future assessments of vessel impairment. In the event that any future impairment were to occur, we would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations performed on an individual vessel basis. Such valuations are not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale, which may be more or less, and should not be relied upon as such.\nThe table set forth below indicates the carrying value of each of our vessels as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, which we believe, based on broker quotes recently obtained, have a basic charter free market value below its carrying value. Noted below the table is the aggregate difference between the carrying value and the basic market value, which represents the approximate amount by which we believe we would have to reduce our net income if we sold all of such vessels, excluding commissions, as of December 31, 2017, on industry standard terms, in cash transactions, and to a willing buyer where we are not under any compulsion to sell, and where the buyer is not under any compulsion to buy. Additionally, given the current dynamic in the dry bulk market, were we to sell a vessel, we might not be able to realize proceeds consistent with the amounts disclosed below.\nTable 153:

</tr>\n</table>\n*Indicates dry bulk carriers for which we believe, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the basic charter-free market value is lower than the vessel's carrying value. We believe that the aggregate carrying value of these vessels exceed their December 31, 2017 and 2016 aggregate basic charter-free market value by approximately $122 million and $180 million, respectively.\nDeferred Drydock Cost\nThere are two methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings: (a) the deferral method where drydock costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period to the next scheduled drydock; and (b) expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred. We use the deferral method of accounting for drydock expenses. Under the deferral method, drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis until the next drydock, which we estimate to be a period of two to five years. We believe the deferral method better matches costs with revenue than expensing the costs as incurred. We use judgment when estimating the period between drydock performed, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessels in the period when contracted. We expect that our vessels will be required to be drydocked approximately every 30 months for vessels older than 15 years and 60 months for vessels younger than 15 years.\nCosts deferred as part of the drydocking include direct costs that are incurred as part of the drydocking to meet regulatory requirements. During drydocking, we capitalize into the cost basis of the vessel any expenditures that add economic life to the vessel, increase the vessel's earnings capacity or improve the vessel's efficiency. Expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs, whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not, are expensed as incurred. Unamortized drydocking costs are written off as drydocking expense if the vessels are drydocked earlier than the applicable amortization period.\nVessel Acquisitions\nWhere we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel, we record all identified tangible and intangible assets or liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to market data and the amount of expected future cash flows. We value any asset or liability arising from the market value of the time charters assumed when an acquired vessel is delivered to us.\nWhere we have assumed an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are less than market charter rates, we record a liability in fair value below contract value of time charters acquired based on the difference between the assumed charter rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent vessel. Conversely, where we assume an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are above market charter rates, we record an asset in fair value above contract value of time charters acquired, based on the difference between the market charter rate and the contracted charter rate for an equivalent vessel. This determination is made at the time the vessel is delivered to us, and such assets and liabilities are amortized to revenue over the remaining period of the charter. The determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates of many variables including market charter rates, expected future charter rates, future vessel operation expenses, the level of utilization of our vessels and our weighted average cost of capital. The use of different assumptions could result in a material change in the fair value of these items, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In the event that the market charter rates relating to the acquired vessels are lower than the contracted charter rates at the time of their respective deliveries to us, our net earnings for the remainder of the terms of the charters may be adversely affected although our cash flows will not be so affected.\nResults of Operations for years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nThe following tables represent the operating data and certain financial statement data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 on a consolidated basis.\nWe believe that the important measures for analyzing future trends in our results of operations consist of the following:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ownership Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chartered-in Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fleet Utilization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Ownership days: We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period. \n \u2022 Chartered-in Days: The Company defines chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which the Company chartered-in vessels. \n \u2022 Available days: We define available days, which the Company has recently updated and is reflected in the above table to better reflect the way management views the business, as the number of our ownership days and chartered-in days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to vessel familiarization upon acquisition, repairs, vessel upgrades or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. We drydocked three vessels in 2017, nine vessels in 2016 and nineteen vessels in 2015. \n \u2022 Operating days: We define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues. \n \u2022 Fleet utilization: We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys or vessel positioning. Our fleet continues to perform at very high utilization rates. \nTime Charter and Voyage Revenue\nShipping revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by a company and the trades in which those vessels operate. In the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry, rates for the transportation of dry bulk cargoes such as ores, grains, steel, fertilizers, and similar commodities, are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for such commodities, the distance that cargoes must be transported, and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported. The demand for shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy and in discrete geographical areas. The number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service, principally because of scrapping.\nThe mix of charters between spot or voyage charters and mid-term time charters also affects revenues. Because the mix between voyage charters and time charters significantly affects shipping revenues and voyage expenses, vessel revenues are benchmarked based on net charter hire income. Net charter hire income comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters, and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating on voyage charters in the spot market and charter hire expenses. Net charter hire serves as a measure of analyzing fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue.\nThe following table represents the reconciliation of Net charter hire income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,784,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,492,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,856,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voyage Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,351,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,093,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,832,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charter hire expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,283,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,845,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,125,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charter hire revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,149,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,553,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,898,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of Net charter hire from\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time charter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voyage charter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial pool\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur economic decisions are based on anticipated Net charter hire rates and we evaluate financial performance based on Net charter rates achieved. Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of days during which our vessels operate and the net charter hire that our vessels earn under charters, which, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including:\n \u2022 the duration of our charters; \n \u2022 our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals; \n \u2022 the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels; \n \u2022 the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs; \n \u2022 maintenance and upgrade work; \n \u2022 the age, condition and specifications of our vessels; \n \u2022 levels of supply and demand in the dry bulk shipping industry; and \n \u2022 other factors affecting spot market charter rates for dry bulk carriers. \nOur revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were earned from time charters, voyage charters and vessel pools. As is common in the shipping industry, we pay commissions ranging from 1.25% to 5% of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers and in-house brokers associated with the charterers, depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the charter.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $236,784,625, an increase of 90% compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in charter hire rates attributable to an improvement in the dry bulk market and increase in available days. The increase in available days was due to the acquisition of 10 Ultramax vessels and an increase in chartered-in days offset by the sale of four vessels during 2017. The chartered-in days for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 3,353 compared to 1,494 in the prior year.\nNet revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $124,492,844 and $103,856,876, respectively. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 20% higher than net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the increase in the number of freight voyages performed and increase in available days. The charter rates year over year have remained flat. The increase in available days was due to the charter-in of vessels and the delivery of a 2016 built Ultramax 61,530 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016 offset by the sale of four vessels during 2016. Our fleet utilization increased from 97.6% during 2015 to 98.7% during 2016.\nVoyage Expenses\nTo the extent that we employ our vessels on voyage charters, we incur expenses that include bunkers, port charges, canal tolls, cargo handling operations and brokerage commissions, as these expenses are borne by the vessel owner on voyage charters. Bunkers, port charges, and canal toll expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters.\nVoyage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $62,351,252, compared with $42,093,714 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Voyage expenses have primarily increased due to an increase in bunker prices as well as an increased number of freight voyages performed in the current year compared to the prior year.\nVoyage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $42,093,714, compared with $23,832,457 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Voyage expenses have primarily increased due to an increase in bunker prices as well as an increased number of freight voyages performed in 2016 compared to 2015.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses include expenses relating to crewing costs, vessel operations, general vessel maintenance, regulatory and classification society compliance, repairs, stores, supplies, spare parts and technical consultants.\nVessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $78,607,244, which represents an increase of $4,590,481, compared with $74,016,763 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in vessel expenses is attributable to the increase in the owned fleet due to the purchase of 10 Ultramax vessels offset by the sale of four vessels during 2017 and four vessels during 2016. The ownership days for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 16,293 compared to 15,408 for the prior year ended December 31, 2016.\nVessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $74,016,763, which represents a decrease of $12,312,297 compared with $86,329,060 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower vessel expenses are attributable to the efficiencies achieved through in-house technical management of vessels as well as sale of the Falcon, Harrier, Peregrine and Kittiwake during 2016, and the sale of the Kite during 2015 offset by the purchase of a 2016 built Ultramax 61,530 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe believe daily vessel operating expenses are a good measure for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation.\nAverage daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4,825 compared to $4,803 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet decreased by $530 per day to $4,803 during 2016 as compared to $5,334 in 2015. The decrease in daily vessel operating expenses was primarily due to lower vessel insurance and cost of lubes.\nInsurance expense varies with overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured's loss record, level of insurance and desired coverage. The main insurance expenses include hull and machinery insurance (i.e. asset insurance) costs, Protection, and Indemnity (\"P & I\") insurance (i.e. liability insurance) costs. Certain other insurances, such as basic war risk premiums based on voyages into designated war risk areas are often for the account of the charterers for time charter voyages and on owners' account for voyage charters.\nOur vessel expenses, which generally represent costs under the vessel operating budgets, cost of insurance and vessel registry and other regulatory fees, will increase with the enlargement of our fleet. Other factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the shipping industry in general, may also cause these expenses to increase, including, for instance, developments relating to market prices for crew, insurance and petroleum-based lubricants and supplies.\nCharter Hire Expense\nThe charter hire expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $31,283,956 compared to $12,845,468 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in charter hire expenses in 2017 compared with 2016 was mainly due to an increase in short term chartered-in vessels resulting from successful implementation of our business strategy. The chartered-in operating days for 2017 were 3,353 compared to 1,494 in 2016. The Company currently charters in one vessel on a long term basis.\nThe charter hire expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $12,845,468 compared to $4,125,766 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in charter hire expense in 2016 compared with 2015 was principally the result of the delivery of a 63,000 dwt new building vessel in May 2016 for a period of nine to fourteen months and a 61,000 dwt new building vessel that was delivered in July 2016 for a period of eleven to thirteen months. In addition, the Company chartered in vessels on a short-term basis as needed. The total charter in days for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 1,494, compared to 382, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel. Depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner. On October 15, 2014, as part of fresh-start reporting, we revalued our vessels, which resulted in a decrease in vessel assets and drydocking assets. We estimate the scrap rate to be $300/lwt to compute each vessel's salvage value.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $33,690,686 and $38,884,322, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a lower depreciation base after the impairment write down of $122.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale of four vessels during 2017 and five vessels during 2016 offset by the purchase of ten Ultramax vessels during 2017 and one Ultramax vessel during the fourth quarter of 2016. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $29,354,017 of depreciation and $4,336,669 of deferred drydocking amortization. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $35,556,911 of depreciation and $3,327,411 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $38,884,322, which represents a decrease of $4,116,419 compared with $43,000,741 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was substantially due to the operation of a smaller fleet resulting from the sale of four vessels in 2016, impairment of six vessels in 2015 reducing the depreciation base and sale of one vessel in 2015 offset by an increase in drydock amortization and the addition of a 2016 built Ultramax 62,350 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $35,556,911 of depreciation and $3,327,411 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs. Total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $41,044,397 of depreciation and $1,956,344 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs.\nDrydocking relates to our regularly scheduled maintenance program necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years for vessels older than 15 years and every five years for vessels younger than 15 years, accordingly, these expenses are deferred and amortized over that period.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses include onshore vessel administration related expenses such as technical management, legal and professional expenses and recurring administrative and other expenses including payroll and expenses relating to our executive officers and office staff, office rent and expenses, directors fees, and directors and officers insurance. General and administrative expenses also include stock-based compensation expenses.\nWe historically entered into technical management agreements for some of our vessels with independent technical managers. On August 24, 2015, the Company provided three months' notice to V. Ships Limited to terminate the technical management contract. The Company completed the transfer of all vessels to in-house technical management during the first quarter of 2016. The technical management fees of $229,062 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $6,110,489 for the year ended December 31, 2015 are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $33,126,310 and $22,905,802, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses due to additional stock grants in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017 and compensation expense due to increased head count. The higher General and administrative expenses are reflective of the expansion of our operating platform.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $22,905,802 and $25,537,007, respectively. The decrease in General and administrative expenses in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower\noffice lease expense, advisors' fees, stock-based compensation expenses and third party technical manager fees offset by lower third party management fees received due to the cancellation of the management agreement with Delphin Shipping LLC.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation charges of $8,738,615 and $2,206,690, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. These stock-based compensation charges relate to the stock options and restricted stock units granted to members of management and certain directors of the Company under the 2014 Plan and the 2016 Plan (see Note 13 Stock Incentive Plans\u201d in the consolidated financial statements).\nInterest and Finance Costs\nInterest Expense consisted of:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Lien Facility / Exit Financing Facility Interest *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,305,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,938,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,781,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,927,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,532,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,146,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment-in-Kind interest on Second Lien Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,098,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,327,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultraco Debt Facility Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Norwegian Bond Debt interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,558,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New First Lien Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility - commitment fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,376,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,799,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,927,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* The Exit Financing Facility was amended and restated on March 30, 2016 as a result of entering into the First Lien Facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, interest rates on our outstanding debt under First Lien Facility ranged from 4.77% to 5.35%, including a margin over LIBOR and commitment fees of 40% of the margin on the undrawn portion of the facility.

The weighted average effective interest rate including the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs for this period was 5.06%.\nForward freight agreements\nThe Company trades in FFAs and bunkers swaps, with the objective of utilizing this market as economic hedging instruments that reduce the risk of specific vessels to changes in the freight market. The Company's FFAs and bunker swaps have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment. As such, unrealized and realized gains are recognized as a component of other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe effect of non-designated derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives not\ndesignated as hedging\ninstruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location of gain/(loss)\nrecognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFAs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other income/(expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(284,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(541,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bunker Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other income/(expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>413,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other income/(expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(561,495\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\n</td> <td>Balance Sheet location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair value of Derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFAs - Unrealized loss\n</td> <td>Fair value of Derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(73,170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bunker Swaps - Unrealized gain\n</td> <td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Collateral Disclosures\nThe Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives by the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral.

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company posted cash collateral related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $178,836 and zero, respectively, which is recorded within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nLoss on extinguishment\nOn December 8, 2017, the Company paid outstanding debt of approximately $265.0 million under the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility through the New First Lien Facility of $65.0 million and issuance of $200.0 million Senior Secured Bonds. As a result, the Company recognized a $15.0 million loss on debt extinguishment in the fourth quarter of 2017. Please see \"Note 8.

The increase in cash flow provided by operations resulted from an increase in the charter hire rates achieved by the Company coupled with an improving dry bulk market offset by negative working capital changes as an increasing percentage of our revenue is earned on voyage charters as opposed to time charters.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $45,434,310, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $43,786,769 in 2015. The increase in cash flow used in operations resulted from negative working capital changes offset by lower drydock expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $155,249,639, compared to $9,280,391 in the prior year. During 2017, the Company purchased ten Ultramax vessels for $174.4 million and advance on purchase of one Ultramax vessel of $2.2 million partially offset by the proceeds from sale of four vessels for $26.0 million. Please refer to \"Note 4.Vessels\" to the consolidated financial statements. During 2017, the Company purchased a certificate of deposit maturing in one year of $4.5 million. During 2016, the Company purchased a 2016 built Ultramax for $18.9 million. In addition, the Company paid $1.9 million as an advance payment for the acquisition of a 2017 built Ultramax. The Company sold four vessels during 2016 for net proceeds of $13.0 million during the year. In 2015, the Company received $7.8 million from the sale of its investment in Korea Line Corporation and $4.2 million from sale of one vessel (the Kite).\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $127,595,602, compared to $106,334,650 in the prior year ended December 31, 2016. The Company received net proceeds of $96.0 million in the December Private Placement, which closed on January 20, 2017 and repaid $13.0 million of its term loan under the First Lien Facility from the proceeds of the sale of the vessels Redwing, Sparrow, Woodstar and Wren. Additionally, the Company completed a refinancing of approximately $191.0 million under the First Lien Facility and $77.4 million under the Second Lien Facility through the New First Lien Facility of $65.0 million and issuance of $200.0 million Senior Secured Bonds issued at a discount of $1.9 million. The Company received $61.2 million from the Ultraco Debt Facility in the second quarter of 2017 and paid $0.9 million to the lender. The Company paid $0.9 million to the lenders of the New First Lien Facility as part of the debt refinancing transaction. The Company also paid $5.2 million in other financing costs in connection with the refinancing transaction. Please see \"Note 8. Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2016, the Company received net proceeds of $85.7 million from a private common stock placement, which closed on August 10, 2016, $60.0 million received from our Second Lien Loan Facility and $15.2 million from the revolver under the First Lien Facility offset by repayment of $21.3 million of our term loan and $30.2 million of our revolver each under the First Lien Facility. The Company also paid $3.1 million in deferred financing costs.\nDuring 2015, we borrowed $40,000,000 from our revolving credit facility under the Exit Financing Facility and repaid $19,625,000 toward the term loan facility under the Exit Financing Facility. In August 2015, we also paid $500,000 to our lenders to amend our Exit Financing Facility and $1,419,228 to settle taxes on net share equity awards.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $56,251,044 compared to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $76,516,110 at December 31, 2016. In addition, our restricted cash balance includes $74,917 for collateralizing letters of credit relating to our office leases as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's debt consisted of $200,000,000 in senior secured bonds, net of $6,049,671 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the Norwegian Bond Debt, $65,000,000 in term loan and revolver, net of $1,241,815 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the New First Lien Facility and $61,200,000, net of $1,224,838 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the Ultraco Debt Facility. In addition, we have $15 million in undrawn revolver available under the Super Senior Facility.\nOur principal sources of funds are operating cash flows, long-term bank borrowings and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our principal use of funds is capital expenditures to establish and grow our fleet, maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, fund working capital requirements and repayments of interest on our outstanding loan facilities. See -Overview-Norwegian Bond Debt\u201d and -Overview-New First Lien Facility and \"-Overview-Ultraco Debt Facility\" for additional information concerning our loan facilities and other debt.\nWe believe that our current financial resources, together with the undrawn revolver under the Super Senior Facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing business needs and other obligations over the next twelve months. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control including, among other things, continuing to improve the profitability of its operations and future cash flows, which contemplates an improvement in charter rates.\nDividends\nThe Company did not make any dividend payments in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In the future, the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will always be subject to the discretion of the board of directors, restrictions contained in the Norwegian Bond Debt terms, the New First Lien Facility and the Ultraco Debt Facility, and the requirements of Marshall Islands law. The timing and amount of any dividends declared will depend on, among other things, the Company's earnings, financial condition and cash requirements and availability, the ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by the Company's growth strategy, the terms of its outstanding indebtedness and the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. The Company does not currently expect to pay dividends in the near term.\nDebt Agreements\nRefer to Note 8 Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements above for a summary of our credit agreements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our expected contractual obligations and their maturity dates as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Within\nOne\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to\nThree\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank Loans(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and borrowing fees(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Norwegian Bond Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chartering agreement (2,3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel acquisition (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>462,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See Note 8. \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements. Interest is based on LIBOR assumption of 1.85%. The Company increased its draw down under the Ultraco Debt Facility by $8.6 million in January 2018 in connection with the acquisition of an UItramax vessel. \n (2) Does not include obligations of chartered-in vessels less than one year. \n (3) On May 10, 2017, we signed an agreement to charter-in a 61,400 dwt, 2013 built Japanese vessel for approximately four years with options for two additional years. The hire rate for the first four years is $12,800 per day. \n (4) On December 19, 2017, the Company, through Ultraco, signed a memorandum of agreement to acquire a 2015 built 64,000 dwt CROWN-63 Ultramax dry bulk vessel constructed at Chengxi Shipyard Co., Ltd for $21.2 million. The Company \ntook delivery of the vessel, the New London Eagle, on January 9, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the Company paid a deposit of $2.2 million for the purchase of the vessel. The Company increased its draw down under the Ultraco Debt Facility by $8.6 million in connection with the acquisition.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures relate to the purchase of vessels and capital improvements to our vessels, which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels.\nIn addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, the Company's other major capital expenditures include funding the Company's program of regularly scheduled drydocking necessary to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Although the Company has some flexibility regarding the timing of its drydocking, the costs are relatively predictable. Management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years for vessels older than 15 years and five years for vessels younger than 15 years. Funding of these requirements is anticipated to be met with cash from operations. We anticipate that this process of recertification will require us to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities, which will reduce our available days and operating days during that period.\nDrydocking costs incurred are deferred and amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the period through the date of the next scheduled drydocking for those vessels. In 2017, three of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $2,579,111 in drydocking related costs. In 2016, nine of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $3,688,711 in drydocking related costs. In 2015, nineteen of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $11,141,561 in drydocking related costs.\nThe following table represents certain information about the estimated costs for anticipated vessel drydockings in the next four quarters, along with the anticipated off-hire days:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ending\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Off-hire Days(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected Costs(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.95 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.95 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.60 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.30 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Actual duration of drydocking will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed.\nContracted Time Charter Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have time charter contracts currently for all our vessels in the operating fleet.

Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report.\nGeneral Overview\nWe are Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc., a Marshall Islands corporation incorporated on March 23, 2005 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. We own one of the largest fleets of Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk vessels in the world. Supramax/Ultramax vessels dry bulk are vessels which are constructed with on-board cranes, ranging in size from approximately 50,000 to 59,000 dwt and Ultramax dry bulk vessels range in size from 60,000 to 65,000 dwt. They are considered a sub-category of the Handymax segment typically defined as 40,000 to 65,000 dwt. We transport a broad range of major and minor bulk cargoes, including but not limited to coal, grain, ore, petcoke, cement and fertilizer, along worldwide shipping routes. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated a modern fleet of 47 Handymax dry bulk vessels. We chartered-in a 61,400 dwt, 2013 built newbuilding Japanese vessel for approximately four years. In addition, the Company charters-in third-party vessels on a short to medium term basis.\nWe are focused on maintaining a high quality fleet that is concentrated primarily in Supramax/ Ultramax dry bulk carriers. These vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on-board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of Panamax dry bulk vessels, which range in size from 72,000 to 83,000 dwt and rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes. We believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the Supramax class vessels make them attractive to cargo interests and vessel charterers. The 47 vessels in our operating fleet, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 2,683,751 dwt, have an average age of 8.2 years as of December 31, 2017.\nRefinancing\nOn December 8, 2017, the Company, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, completed a refinancing of approximately $265,000,000 under (i) the First Lien Facility and (ii) the Second Lien Facility, through (a) the New First Lien Facility of $65,000,000, and (b) the issuance by Shipco, the Norwegian Bond Debt of $200,000,000. In addition, Shipco entered into the Super Senior Facility of $15,000,000. For more information about the terms of the New First Lien Facility, the Norwegian Bank Debt and the Super Senior Facility, see Note 8. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nCorporate Reorganization\nIn connection with the refinancing transactions, the Company consummated an internal reorganization. As part of the internal reorganization, Eagle Shipping transferred ownership of certain wholly-owned vessel-owning subsidiaries to Shipco, such that Shipco became the parent to 28 vessel-owning subsidiaries. Additionally, all management and technical services will now be conducted under Eagle Bulk Management LLC, a newly-formed limited liability company existing under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nUltraco Debt Facility\nOn June 28, 2017, Ultraco entered into the Ultraco Debt Facility, which provided for a multi-draw senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to the lesser of (i) $61,200,000 and (ii) 40% of the lesser of (1) the purchase price of the nine Greenship Vessels, and (2) the fair market value of the Greenship Vessels. The proceeds of the Ultraco Debt Facility were used for the purpose of financing a part of the acquisition cost of the Greenship Vessels.\nOn December 29, 2017, Ultraco entered into the First Amendment to the Ultraco Debt Facility to increase the commitments for the purpose of financing the acquisition of an additional vessel by New London Eagle LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ultraco and additional guarantor under the Ultraco Debt Facility. The increase in the commitments was $8.6 million. Ultraco took delivery of the vessel in January 2018 and drew down $8.6 million. The Company paid a deposit of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company has drawn $61.2 million under the Ultraco Debt Facility.\nFor more information about the terms of the Ultraco Debt Facility and the First Amendment, see Note 8. Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following are certain significant events with respect to our vessels that occurred during 2016 and 2017:\n \u2022 On April 26, 2016, the Company sold the vessel Peregrine for $2.6 million, after brokerage commissions and associated selling expenses, and recorded a net loss of approximately $150,000 in the second quarter of 2016.

The vessel is expected to be delivered to the buyers in the second quarter of 2018. The Company expects to recognize a gain of $0.3 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company reported the carrying amount of the vessel as vessel held for sale in its consolidated balance sheet. \n \u2022 On December 19. 2017, the Company, through Ultraco, signed a memorandum of agreement to acquire a 2015 built 64,000 dwt CROWN-83 Ultramax dry bulk vessel constructed at Chengxi Shipyard Co., Ltd for $21.2 million. The Company took delivery of the vessel, the New London Eagle, on January 9, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the Company paid a deposit of $2.2 million for the purchase of the vessel. \nThe following are certain significant events with respect to our vessels that occurred during 2015:\n \u2022 In April 2015, the Company decided to sell the Kite, a 1997-built Handymax, and reached an agreement to sell the vessel for $4.3 million after brokerage commissions payable to a third party. On May 7, 2015, the Company sold the vessel and realized a net loss of approximately $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. \n \u2022 On May 20, 2015, the Company delivered a 90 day termination notice to Navig8 Pool to terminate the pool arrangements for all of its vessels in the Navig8 Pool. The notice of termination was given pursuant to the terms of the Company's pool agreement. \n \u2022 On August 24, 2015, the Company provided three months' notice to V. Ships Limited to terminate the technical management contract. The Company completed the transfer of all vessels to in-house technical management during the first quarter of 2016. \nBusiness Strategy and Outlook:\nWe believe our strong balance sheet allows us the flexibility to opportunistically make investments in the dry bulk segment that will drive shareholder growth. In order to accomplish this, we intend to:\n \u2022 Maintain a highly efficient and the high quality fleet in the dry bulk segment. \n \u2022 Maintain a revenue strategy that takes advantage of a rising rate environment and at the same time mitigate risk in a declining rate environment. \n \u2022 Maintain a cost structure that allow us to be competitive in all economic cycles without sacrificing safety and maintenance. \n \u2022 Continue to grow our relationships with our charterers and vendors \n \u2022 Continue to invest in our on-shore operations and development of processes. \nOur financial performance is based on the following key elements of our business strategy:\n (1) concentration in one vessel category: Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk vessels, which we believe offer certain size, operational and geographical advantages relative to other classes of dry bulk vessels, such as Handymax, Panamax and Capesize vessels, \n (2) An active owner-operator model where we seek to operate our own fleet and develop contractual relationships directly with cargo interests. These relationships and the related cargo contracts have the dual benefit of providing greater operational efficiencies and act as a balance to the Company's naturally long position to the market. Notwithstanding the focus on voyage chartering, we consistently monitor the dry bulk shipping market and, based on market conditions, will consider taking advantage of long-term time charters at higher rates when appropriate. \n (3) Maintain high quality vessels and improve standards of operation through improved standards and procedures, crew training and repair and maintenance procedures. \nWe have employed all of our vessels on time and voyage charters. The following table represents certain information about our revenue earning charters on our operating fleet as of December 31, 2017:\n\n\n\n (1) The vessel is contracted to perform a time charter after the drydock at a rate of $11,400. \n (2) The vessel is contracted to continue the existing time charter at an increased charter rate of $11,000 after January 14, 2018. \n (3) The vessel is contracted to continue the existing time charter at an increased charter rate of $11,000 after January 23, 2018. \n (4) The vessel is contracted to continue the existing time charter at an increased charter rate of $12,000 after January 16, 2018. \n (5) The vessel is contracted to continue the existing time charter at an increased charter rate of $10,000 after March 10, 2018. \n (6) The vessel is contracted to continue the existing time charter at an increased charter rate of $10,500 after March 10, 2018. \n (7) The vessel is contracted to continue the existing time charter at an increased charter rate of $10,500 after February 18, 2018. \n (8) The vessel is contracted to continue the existing time charter at an increased charter rate of $9,500 after February 28, 2018. \nMarket Overview\nThe international shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented with no single owner accounting for more than 5% of the on-the-water fleet. As of December 31, 2017, there are approximately 11,116 dry bulk carriers (over 10,000 dwt) totaling 817 million dwt. We compete with other (primarily private) owners of dry bulk vessels in the Handysize, Supramax, and Panamax asset classes.\nCompetition in the dry bulk trade is robust. Demand is a function of world economic conditions and the consequent requirement for commodities, production and consumption patterns, as well as events, which interrupt production, trade routes, and consumption. We compete for charters based on price, vessel location, size, age, and condition, as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator. Customers, or charterers, tend to prefer modern vessels (over older ships) due to their greater operational reliability, lower fuel consumption, and improved built-designs complying with more recent regulation standards. Consequently, owners of large modern fleets tend to have a competitive advantage over owners operating older ships.\nOur strategy is to focus on the Supramax/Ultramax asset class, which is part of the broader Handymax segment, defined as dry bulk vessels between 40,000 to 65,000 dwt. Supramax/Ultramax vessels range in size from approximately 50,000 to 65,000 dwt. These vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility offered by their on-board cranes, while the cargo carrying capacity approaches that of Panamax, which ranges in size between 72,000 and 83,000 dwt and which require onshore facilities to load and offload their cargoes. We believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the Supramax/Ultramax class makes it the preferred type of ship attractive to potential charterers. All 47 of our owned vessels, as of December 31, 2017, range in size between 50,000 and 64,000 dwt.\nThe supply of dry bulk vessels depends primarily on the level of the orderbook, the fleet age profile, and the operating efficiency of the existing fleet. As of December 2017, 8% of the world Handymax fleet was 20 years or older, while the newbuilding orderbook stood at 6.5% of the (Handymax) on-the-water fleet. The 47 vessels in our operating fleet have an average age of approximately 8.2 years as of December 31, 2017. The typical trading life of a Handymax vessel is approximately 25 years.\nThe Handymax Market\nIn 2017, drybulk global market continued to recover from a historic market low from early 2016. Trade demand grew by 4% in 2017, as compared to an increase of 1.2% in 2016. The improvement in demand was primarily driven by an increase in trades relating to iron ore, coal and grain as well as the minor bulks. On the supply side, net fleet growth (newbuilding deliveries less scrapping) amounted to 2.9% for 2017, as compared to 2.3% for the year prior. Although 2017 newbuilding deliveries decreased by 108 vessels, or 20% from the prior year, scrapping decreased by a greater amount causing net fleet growth to increase slightly year-on-year. Scrapping totaled 214 vessels in 2017, as compared to 408 in 2016, representing a drop of 48%. The Baltic Supramax Index ( BSI\u201d), a dry bulk index based on 52,000 dwt vessels, averaged $9,185 for 2017. The improvement in rates during the year was driven by increased demolition (of older vessels), lower supply growth, and higher iron ore and coal flows into China.\nLooking ahead, newbuilding deliveries for 2018 (and beyond) are expected to continue their downward trend, with the orderbook currently standing at approximately 10% of the existing fleet. Drybulk trade, which tends to be correlated to global GDP, is expected to improve by approximately 2% in 2018, driven by increased flows in iron ore, coal, grains, and minor bulks.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d or GAAP\u201d). The preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nCritical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies, because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application. For a description of all our accounting policies, see Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are generated from time charters, voyage charters and commercial pool arrangements. Time charter revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective time charter agreements as service is provided. Voyage revenues for cargo transportation are recognized ratably over the estimated relative transit time of each voyage. Voyage revenue is deemed to commence upon the completion of discharge of the previous charterer's cargo and is deemed to end upon the completion of discharge of the current cargo, provided an agreed non-cancellable charter between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue under voyage charters will not be recognized until a charter has been agreed even if the vessel has discharged its previous cargo and is proceeding to an anticipated port of loading.\nRevenues generated from time charters linked to the Baltic Supramax index and/or revenues generated from profit sharing arrangements are recognized over the term of the respective time charter agreements as service is provided and the profit sharing is fixed and determinable.\nFor the Company's vessel operating in a Commercial Pool, revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and allocated to each pool participant under a time charter agreement basis in accordance with an agreed-upon formula. The formula in the pool agreement for allocating gross shipping revenues net of voyage expenses is based on points allocated to participants' vessels based on cargo carrying capacity and other technical characteristics, such as speed and fuel consumption. We had one vessel operating in a commercial pool until April 2017.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, and shall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update provides further guidance on applying collectability criterion to assess whether the contract is valid and represents a substantive transaction on the basis whether a customer has the ability and intention to pay the promised consideration. The requirements of this standard include an increase in required disclosures. Management has not yet selected a transition method and is currently analyzing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements, including assessing changes that might be necessary to information technology systems, processes and internal controls to capture new data and address changes in financial reporting. The Company believes that the adoption of the standard will impact the timing of recognition of revenue. Management will apply the modified retrospective transition method and will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting this standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted. The Company continues to make progress in its implementation and assessment of the new revenue standard. While the assessment is still ongoing, based on the progress made to date, the Company expects that the timing of recognition of revenue for certain ongoing charter contracts will be impacted as well as the timing of recognition of certain voyage related costs. While the assessment of certain effects of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 are ongoing, the timing of recognition will primarily impact spot voyage charters. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue will be recognized from when the vessel arrives at the load port\nuntil the completion of discharge at the discharge port instead of recognizing revenue from the discharge of the previous voyage provided an agreed non-cancellable charter between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The financial impact of adoption will depend on the number of spot voyages and time charter arrangements as well as their percentage of completion at January 1, 2018. The Company expects that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will result in an increase in the opening Accumulated Deficit balance as of January 1, 2018 in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $0.5 million to $1.3 million as a result of the adjustment of Revenue and Voyage expenses. The above estimate could potentially change upon further evaluation. Additionally, the Company is currently evaluating the adjustment, if any, to other expenses such as Vessel expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the additional presentation and disclosure requirements of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is based on contracted charter parties, including spot-market related time charters for which rates fluctuate based on changes in the spot market. However, there is always the possibility of dispute over terms and payment of hires and freights. In particular, disagreements may arise as to the responsibility for third party costs incurred by the customer and revenue due to us as a result. Additionally, there are certain performance parameters included in contracted charter parties, which if not met, can result in customer claims. Accordingly, we periodically assess the recoverability of amounts outstanding and estimate a provision if there is a possibility of non-recoverability. At each balance sheet date, we provide a provision based on a review of all outstanding charter receivables. Although we believe our provisions to be reasonable at the time they are made, it is possible that an amount under dispute is not ultimately recovered and the estimated provision for doubtful accounts is inadequate.\nVessel Lives and Impairment\nThe Company estimates the useful life of the Company's vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner. In addition, the Company estimates the scrap rate to be $300 per lwt, to compute each vessel's salvage value, which is based on the 15-year average scrap value of steel.\nThe carrying values of the Company's vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of new buildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. We evaluate the carrying amounts and periods over which long-lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives. In evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long-lived assets, we review certain indicators of potential impairment, such as vessel sales and purchases, business plans and overall market conditions.\nIf indicators of impairment are present, we perform an analysis of the undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for each vessel and compare it to the vessel's carrying value. This assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available. In developing estimates of future cash flows, the Company must make assumptions about future charter rates, ship-operating expenses, and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, we utilize the rates currently in effect for the duration of their current time charters, without assuming additional profit sharing. For periods of time where our vessels are not fixed on time charters, we utilize an estimated daily time charter equivalent for our vessels' unfixed days based on a historical average of the last twenty five years of one to three years' time charters, though we consider whether using a ten or fifteen year average would result in a materially different conclusion. Actual equivalent dry bulk shipping rates are currently lower than the estimated rate. We believe current rates have been driven by short-term disruptions in demand and a slowdown in the availability of global credit. The projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the future charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days and for the unfixed days, projected FFA rates up to 2019 and an estimated daily time charter equivalent over the estimated remaining life of the vessel, assumed to be 25 years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard, reduced by brokerage commissions, expected outflows for vessels' maintenance and vessel operating expenses (including planned drydocking and special survey expenditures) and capital expenditures adjusted annually for inflation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company evaluated if any impairment indicators existed as of December 31, 2017. Based on the evaluation, the Company determined that there were impairment indicators for 22 vessels in the Company's fleet for which the vessel prices based on vessel valuations received from third party brokers were lower than their carrying values. The Company considered this to be an impairment indicator and performed an impairment test on the 22 vessels.\nOf the inputs that the Company uses for its impairment analysis, future time charter rates are the most significant and most volatile. We utilize historical averages as discussed above in our impairment tests due to the highly cyclical nature of the drybulk shipping industry. Our vessels range from very new to fifteen years old, and we believe that utilizing rates\nover a long period of time incorporates numerous shipping cycles and reflects our strategy of operating our vessels over a long time period, and in line with the overall useful economic life of our vessels. As disclosed elsewhere herein, we also consider whether utilizing ten or fifteen year averages would impact our impairment assessment. Then ten and fifteen year averages are higher than our estimate and therefore will impact our impairment test positively. Our vessels remain fully utilized and have a relatively long average remaining useful life of approximately 16.8 years in which to provide sufficient cash flows on an undiscounted basis to recover their carrying values as of December 31, 2017. Management will continue to monitor developments in charter rates in our participatory markets with respect to the expectation of future rates over an extended period.\nA comparison of the average estimated daily time charter equivalent rate used in our impairment analysis with the average break even rate at which the undiscounted cash flows for all of our vessels will be lower than their carrying value as of December 31, 2017 ( average break even rate\u201d) for our vessels is presented below:\n\nFor the purpose of presenting our investors with additional information to determine how the Company's future results of operations may be impacted in the event that daily time charter rates do not improve from their current levels in future periods, we set forth in the table below analysis that shows the 1 year, 3 year, 5 year and 10 year averages blended rates and the effect of the use of each of these rates would have on the Company's impairment analysis:\n\nManagement does not believe that one year, three year, and five year historical average is reflective of the cyclical nature of shipping business, which tends to have cycles much longer than one, three or five years.\nBased on our impairment analysis, we determined that as of December 31, 2017, the future cash flows expected to be earned by the 22 vessels on an undiscounted basis would exceed their carrying value and therefore no impairment charges were recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as part of our fleet renewal program, management considered it probable that we would divest some of our older vessels as well as certain less efficient vessels from its fleet to achieve operating cost savings. The Company identified two groups of vessels. Group 1 vessels were selected based on the shipyard they were built and their technical specifications. The group consists of five sister ships constructed in the Dayang shipyard with 53,000 dwt. These vessels were identified by management as having poorer fuel efficiency, among other reasons, compared to their peers. The second group of 11 vessels are older than 13 years and less than 53,000 dwt. Based on our projected undiscounted cash flows prior to sale, factoring the probability of sale, such vessels were determined to be impaired, and written down to their current fair value as of December 31, 2016, which was determined by obtaining broker quotes from two unaffiliated shipbrokers. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $122,860,600 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The carrying value of these vessels prior to impairment was $234,860,600. In addition to the above, in 2015, we identified six vessels as probable sales, and recognized an impairment charge in 2015 of $50,872,734. As the value of such vessels further declined in the first quarter of 2016, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $6,167,262 in that quarter. Out of the six vessels initially identified in 2015, all vessels have been sold as of December 31, 2017. Out of the sixteen vessels impaired in 2016, two vessels were sold during 2017 and a memorandum of sale agreement was signed on the third one. The Company expects to deliver the vessel to the buyers in the second quarter of 2018.\nAlthough management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective. Charter rates may remain at depressed levels for some time, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, and future assessments of vessel impairment. In the event that any future impairment were to occur, we would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations performed on an individual vessel basis. Such valuations are not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale, which may be more or less, and should not be relied upon as such.\nThe table set forth below indicates the carrying value of each of our vessels as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, which we believe, based on broker quotes recently obtained, have a basic charter free market value below its carrying value. Noted below the table is the aggregate difference between the carrying value and the basic market value, which represents the approximate amount by which we believe we would have to reduce our net income if we sold all of such vessels, excluding commissions, as of December 31, 2017, on industry standard terms, in cash transactions, and to a willing buyer where we are not under any compulsion to sell, and where the buyer is not under any compulsion to buy. Additionally, given the current dynamic in the dry bulk market, were we to sell a vessel, we might not be able to realize proceeds consistent with the amounts disclosed below.\n\n*Indicates dry bulk carriers for which we believe, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the basic charter-free market value is lower than the vessel's carrying value. We believe that the aggregate carrying value of these vessels exceed their December 31, 2017 and 2016 aggregate basic charter-free market value by approximately $122 million and $180 million, respectively.\nDeferred Drydock Cost\nThere are two methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings: (a) the deferral method where drydock costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period to the next scheduled drydock; and (b) expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred. We use the deferral method of accounting for drydock expenses. Under the deferral method, drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis until the next drydock, which we estimate to be a period of two to five years. We believe the deferral method better matches costs with revenue than expensing the costs as incurred. We use judgment when estimating the period between drydock performed, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessels in the period when contracted. We expect that our vessels will be required to be drydocked approximately every 30 months for vessels older than 15 years and 60 months for vessels younger than 15 years.\nCosts deferred as part of the drydocking include direct costs that are incurred as part of the drydocking to meet regulatory requirements. During drydocking, we capitalize into the cost basis of the vessel any expenditures that add economic life to the vessel, increase the vessel's earnings capacity or improve the vessel's efficiency. Expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs, whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not, are expensed as incurred. Unamortized drydocking costs are written off as drydocking expense if the vessels are drydocked earlier than the applicable amortization period.\nVessel Acquisitions\nWhere we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel, we record all identified tangible and intangible assets or liabilities at fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to market data and the amount of expected future cash flows. We value any asset or liability arising from the market value of the time charters assumed when an acquired vessel is delivered to us.\nWhere we have assumed an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are less than market charter rates, we record a liability in fair value below contract value of time charters acquired based on the difference between the assumed charter rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent vessel. Conversely, where we assume an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are above market charter rates, we record an asset in fair value above contract value of time charters acquired, based on the difference between the market charter rate and the contracted charter rate for an equivalent vessel. This determination is made at the time the vessel is delivered to us, and such assets and liabilities are amortized to revenue over the remaining period of the charter. The determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates of many variables including market charter rates, expected future charter rates, future vessel operation expenses, the level of utilization of our vessels and our weighted average cost of capital. The use of different assumptions could result in a material change in the fair value of these items, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In the event that the market charter rates relating to the acquired vessels are lower than the contracted charter rates at the time of their respective deliveries to us, our net earnings for the remainder of the terms of the charters may be adversely affected although our cash flows will not be so affected.\nResults of Operations for years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nThe following tables represent the operating data and certain financial statement data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 on a consolidated basis.\nWe believe that the important measures for analyzing future trends in our results of operations consist of the following:\n\n \u2022 Ownership days: We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period. \n \u2022 Chartered-in Days: The Company defines chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which the Company chartered-in vessels. \n \u2022 Available days: We define available days, which the Company has recently updated and is reflected in the above table to better reflect the way management views the business, as the number of our ownership days and chartered-in days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to vessel familiarization upon acquisition, repairs, vessel upgrades or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. We drydocked three vessels in 2017, nine vessels in 2016 and nineteen vessels in 2015. \n \u2022 Operating days: We define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues. \n \u2022 Fleet utilization: We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys or vessel positioning. Our fleet continues to perform at very high utilization rates. \nTime Charter and Voyage Revenue\nShipping revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by a company and the trades in which those vessels operate. In the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry, rates for the transportation of dry bulk cargoes such as ores, grains, steel, fertilizers, and similar commodities, are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for such commodities, the distance that cargoes must be transported, and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported. The demand for shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy and in discrete geographical areas. The number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service, principally because of scrapping.\nThe mix of charters between spot or voyage charters and mid-term time charters also affects revenues. Because the mix between voyage charters and time charters significantly affects shipping revenues and voyage expenses, vessel revenues are benchmarked based on net charter hire income. Net charter hire income comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters, and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating on voyage charters in the spot market and charter hire expenses. Net charter hire serves as a measure of analyzing fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue.\nThe following table represents the reconciliation of Net charter hire income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n\nOur economic decisions are based on anticipated Net charter hire rates and we evaluate financial performance based on Net charter rates achieved. Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of days during which our vessels operate and the net charter hire that our vessels earn under charters, which, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including:\n \u2022 the duration of our charters; \n \u2022 our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals; \n \u2022 the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels; \n \u2022 the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs; \n \u2022 maintenance and upgrade work; \n \u2022 the age, condition and specifications of our vessels; \n \u2022 levels of supply and demand in the dry bulk shipping industry; and \n \u2022 other factors affecting spot market charter rates for dry bulk carriers. \nOur revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were earned from time charters, voyage charters and vessel pools. As is common in the shipping industry, we pay commissions ranging from 1.25% to 5% of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers and in-house brokers associated with the charterers, depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the charter.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $236,784,625, an increase of 90% compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in charter hire rates attributable to an improvement in the dry bulk market and increase in available days. The increase in available days was due to the acquisition of 10 Ultramax vessels and an increase in chartered-in days offset by the sale of four vessels during 2017. The chartered-in days for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 3,353 compared to 1,494 in the prior year.\nNet revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $124,492,844 and $103,856,876, respectively. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 20% higher than net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the increase in the number of freight voyages performed and increase in available days. The charter rates year over year have remained flat. The increase in available days was due to the charter-in of vessels and the delivery of a 2016 built Ultramax 61,530 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016 offset by the sale of four vessels during 2016. Our fleet utilization increased from 97.6% during 2015 to 98.7% during 2016.\nVoyage Expenses\nTo the extent that we employ our vessels on voyage charters, we incur expenses that include bunkers, port charges, canal tolls, cargo handling operations and brokerage commissions, as these expenses are borne by the vessel owner on voyage charters. Bunkers, port charges, and canal toll expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters.\nVoyage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $62,351,252, compared with $42,093,714 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Voyage expenses have primarily increased due to an increase in bunker prices as well as an increased number of freight voyages performed in the current year compared to the prior year.\nVoyage expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $42,093,714, compared with $23,832,457 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Voyage expenses have primarily increased due to an increase in bunker prices as well as an increased number of freight voyages performed in 2016 compared to 2015.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses include expenses relating to crewing costs, vessel operations, general vessel maintenance, regulatory and classification society compliance, repairs, stores, supplies, spare parts and technical consultants.\nVessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $78,607,244, which represents an increase of $4,590,481, compared with $74,016,763 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in vessel expenses is attributable to the increase in the owned fleet due to the purchase of 10 Ultramax vessels offset by the sale of four vessels during 2017 and four vessels during 2016. The ownership days for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 16,293 compared to 15,408 for the prior year ended December 31, 2016.\nVessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $74,016,763, which represents a decrease of $12,312,297 compared with $86,329,060 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower vessel expenses are attributable to the efficiencies achieved through in-house technical management of vessels as well as sale of the Falcon, Harrier, Peregrine and Kittiwake during 2016, and the sale of the Kite during 2015 offset by the purchase of a 2016 built Ultramax 61,530 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe believe daily vessel operating expenses are a good measure for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation.\nAverage daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4,825 compared to $4,803 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet decreased by $530 per day to $4,803 during 2016 as compared to $5,334 in 2015. The decrease in daily vessel operating expenses was primarily due to lower vessel insurance and cost of lubes.\nInsurance expense varies with overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured's loss record, level of insurance and desired coverage. The main insurance expenses include hull and machinery insurance (i.e. asset insurance) costs, Protection, and Indemnity (\"P & I\") insurance (i.e. liability insurance) costs. Certain other insurances, such as basic war risk premiums based on voyages into designated war risk areas are often for the account of the charterers for time charter voyages and on owners' account for voyage charters.\nOur vessel expenses, which generally represent costs under the vessel operating budgets, cost of insurance and vessel registry and other regulatory fees, will increase with the enlargement of our fleet. Other factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the shipping industry in general, may also cause these expenses to increase, including, for instance, developments relating to market prices for crew, insurance and petroleum-based lubricants and supplies.\nCharter Hire Expense\nThe charter hire expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $31,283,956 compared to $12,845,468 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in charter hire expenses in 2017 compared with 2016 was mainly due to an increase in short term chartered-in vessels resulting from successful implementation of our business strategy. The chartered-in operating days for 2017 were 3,353 compared to 1,494 in 2016. The Company currently charters in one vessel on a long term basis.\nThe charter hire expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $12,845,468 compared to $4,125,766 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in charter hire expense in 2016 compared with 2015 was principally the result of the delivery of a 63,000 dwt new building vessel in May 2016 for a period of nine to fourteen months and a 61,000 dwt new building vessel that was delivered in July 2016 for a period of eleven to thirteen months. In addition, the Company chartered in vessels on a short-term basis as needed. The total charter in days for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 1,494, compared to 382, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel. Depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner. On October 15, 2014, as part of fresh-start reporting, we revalued our vessels, which resulted in a decrease in vessel assets and drydocking assets. We estimate the scrap rate to be $300/lwt to compute each vessel's salvage value.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $33,690,686 and $38,884,322, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a lower depreciation base after the impairment write down of $122.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale of four vessels during 2017 and five vessels during 2016 offset by the purchase of ten Ultramax vessels during 2017 and one Ultramax vessel during the fourth quarter of 2016. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $29,354,017 of depreciation and $4,336,669 of deferred drydocking amortization. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $35,556,911 of depreciation and $3,327,411 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $38,884,322, which represents a decrease of $4,116,419 compared with $43,000,741 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was substantially due to the operation of a smaller fleet resulting from the sale of four vessels in 2016, impairment of six vessels in 2015 reducing the depreciation base and sale of one vessel in 2015 offset by an increase in drydock amortization and the addition of a 2016 built Ultramax 62,350 dwt vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $35,556,911 of depreciation and $3,327,411 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs. Total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $41,044,397 of depreciation and $1,956,344 of amortization of deferred drydocking costs.\nDrydocking relates to our regularly scheduled maintenance program necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years for vessels older than 15 years and every five years for vessels younger than 15 years, accordingly, these expenses are deferred and amortized over that period.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses include onshore vessel administration related expenses such as technical management, legal and professional expenses and recurring administrative and other expenses including payroll and expenses relating to our executive officers and office staff, office rent and expenses, directors fees, and directors and officers insurance. General and administrative expenses also include stock-based compensation expenses.\nWe historically entered into technical management agreements for some of our vessels with independent technical managers. On August 24, 2015, the Company provided three months' notice to V. Ships Limited to terminate the technical management contract. The Company completed the transfer of all vessels to in-house technical management during the first quarter of 2016. The technical management fees of $229,062 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $6,110,489 for the year ended December 31, 2015 are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $33,126,310 and $22,905,802, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses due to additional stock grants in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017 and compensation expense due to increased head count. The higher General and administrative expenses are reflective of the expansion of our operating platform.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $22,905,802 and $25,537,007, respectively. The decrease in General and administrative expenses in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower\noffice lease expense, advisors' fees, stock-based compensation expenses and third party technical manager fees offset by lower third party management fees received due to the cancellation of the management agreement with Delphin Shipping LLC.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation charges of $8,738,615 and $2,206,690, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. These stock-based compensation charges relate to the stock options and restricted stock units granted to members of management and certain directors of the Company under the 2014 Plan and the 2016 Plan (see Note 13 Stock Incentive Plans\u201d in the consolidated financial statements).\nInterest and Finance Costs\nInterest Expense consisted of:\n\n* The Exit Financing Facility was amended and restated on March 30, 2016 as a result of entering into the First Lien Facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, interest rates on our outstanding debt under First Lien Facility ranged from 4.77% to 5.35%, including a margin over LIBOR and commitment fees of 40% of the margin on the undrawn portion of the facility. The weighted average effective interest rate was 6.18%. The interest rates on our outstanding debt under Ultraco Debt Facility ranged from 4.19% to 4.28%, including a margin over LIBOR applicable under the terms of the Ultraco Debt Facility which was entered into on June 28, 2017. The weighted average effective interest rate was 4.71%. The Norwegian Bond debt carries an interest rate of 8.25%. The weighted average effective interest rate on the same was 8.84%. The interest rate on our outstanding debt under New First Lien Facility was 4.83% including a margin over LIBOR applicable under the terms of the New First Lien Facility which was entered into on December 8, 2017. The weighted average effective interest rate was 5.21%.\nFor 2016, interest rates on our outstanding debt ranged from 3.86% to 4.99%, including a margin over LIBOR applicable under the terms of the First Lien Facility. The weighted average effective interest rate, including the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs for this period was 6.83%.\nFor 2015, interest rates on our outstanding debt ranged from 3.696% to 4.08%, including a margin over LIBOR applicable under the terms of the First Lien Facility. The weighted average effective interest rate including the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs for this period was 5.06%.\nForward freight agreements\nThe Company trades in FFAs and bunkers swaps, with the objective of utilizing this market as economic hedging instruments that reduce the risk of specific vessels to changes in the freight market. The Company's FFAs and bunker swaps have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment. As such, unrealized and realized gains are recognized as a component of other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe effect of non-designated derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows:\n\n\nCash Collateral Disclosures\nThe Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives by the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral. The amount of collateral to be posted is defined in the terms of respective master agreement executed with counterparties or exchanges and is required when agreed upon threshold limits are exceeded. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company posted cash collateral related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $178,836 and zero, respectively, which is recorded within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nLoss on extinguishment\nOn December 8, 2017, the Company paid outstanding debt of approximately $265.0 million under the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility through the New First Lien Facility of $65.0 million and issuance of $200.0 million Senior Secured Bonds. As a result, the Company recognized a $15.0 million loss on debt extinguishment in the fourth quarter of 2017. Please see \"Note 8. Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe Company does not believe that inflation has had or is likely, in the near future, to have a significant impact on vessel operating expenses, drydocking expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents the cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7,388,971, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $45,434,310 in 2016. The increase in cash flow provided by operations resulted from an increase in the charter hire rates achieved by the Company coupled with an improving dry bulk market offset by negative working capital changes as an increasing percentage of our revenue is earned on voyage charters as opposed to time charters.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $45,434,310, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $43,786,769 in 2015. The increase in cash flow used in operations resulted from negative working capital changes offset by lower drydock expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $155,249,639, compared to $9,280,391 in the prior year. During 2017, the Company purchased ten Ultramax vessels for $174.4 million and advance on purchase of one Ultramax vessel of $2.2 million partially offset by the proceeds from sale of four vessels for $26.0 million. Please refer to \"Note 4.Vessels\" to the consolidated financial statements. During 2017, the Company purchased a certificate of deposit maturing in one year of $4.5 million. During 2016, the Company purchased a 2016 built Ultramax for $18.9 million. In addition, the Company paid $1.9 million as an advance payment for the acquisition of a 2017 built Ultramax. The Company sold four vessels during 2016 for net proceeds of $13.0 million during the year. In 2015, the Company received $7.8 million from the sale of its investment in Korea Line Corporation and $4.2 million from sale of one vessel (the Kite).\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $127,595,602, compared to $106,334,650 in the prior year ended December 31, 2016. The Company received net proceeds of $96.0 million in the December Private Placement, which closed on January 20, 2017 and repaid $13.0 million of its term loan under the First Lien Facility from the proceeds of the sale of the vessels Redwing, Sparrow, Woodstar and Wren. Additionally, the Company completed a refinancing of approximately $191.0 million under the First Lien Facility and $77.4 million under the Second Lien Facility through the New First Lien Facility of $65.0 million and issuance of $200.0 million Senior Secured Bonds issued at a discount of $1.9 million. The Company received $61.2 million from the Ultraco Debt Facility in the second quarter of 2017 and paid $0.9 million to the lender. The Company paid $0.9 million to the lenders of the New First Lien Facility as part of the debt refinancing transaction. The Company also paid $5.2 million in other financing costs in connection with the refinancing transaction. Please see \"Note 8. Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2016, the Company received net proceeds of $85.7 million from a private common stock placement, which closed on August 10, 2016, $60.0 million received from our Second Lien Loan Facility and $15.2 million from the revolver under the First Lien Facility offset by repayment of $21.3 million of our term loan and $30.2 million of our revolver each under the First Lien Facility. The Company also paid $3.1 million in deferred financing costs.\nDuring 2015, we borrowed $40,000,000 from our revolving credit facility under the Exit Financing Facility and repaid $19,625,000 toward the term loan facility under the Exit Financing Facility. In August 2015, we also paid $500,000 to our lenders to amend our Exit Financing Facility and $1,419,228 to settle taxes on net share equity awards.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $56,251,044 compared to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $76,516,110 at December 31, 2016. In addition, our restricted cash balance includes $74,917 for collateralizing letters of credit relating to our office leases as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's debt consisted of $200,000,000 in senior secured bonds, net of $6,049,671 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the Norwegian Bond Debt, $65,000,000 in term loan and revolver, net of $1,241,815 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the New First Lien Facility and $61,200,000, net of $1,224,838 debt discount and debt issuance costs under the Ultraco Debt Facility. In addition, we have $15 million in undrawn revolver available under the Super Senior Facility.\nOur principal sources of funds are operating cash flows, long-term bank borrowings and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our principal use of funds is capital expenditures to establish and grow our fleet, maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, fund working capital requirements and repayments of interest on our outstanding loan facilities. See -Overview-Norwegian Bond Debt\u201d and -Overview-New First Lien Facility and \"-Overview-Ultraco Debt Facility\" for additional information concerning our loan facilities and other debt.\nWe believe that our current financial resources, together with the undrawn revolver under the Super Senior Facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing business needs and other obligations over the next twelve months. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control including, among other things, continuing to improve the profitability of its operations and future cash flows, which contemplates an improvement in charter rates.\nDividends\nThe Company did not make any dividend payments in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In the future, the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will always be subject to the discretion of the board of directors, restrictions contained in the Norwegian Bond Debt terms, the New First Lien Facility and the Ultraco Debt Facility, and the requirements of Marshall Islands law. The timing and amount of any dividends declared will depend on, among other things, the Company's earnings, financial condition and cash requirements and availability, the ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by the Company's growth strategy, the terms of its outstanding indebtedness and the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. The Company does not currently expect to pay dividends in the near term.\nDebt Agreements\nRefer to Note 8 Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements above for a summary of our credit agreements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our expected contractual obligations and their maturity dates as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) See Note 8. \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements. Interest is based on LIBOR assumption of 1.85%. The Company increased its draw down under the Ultraco Debt Facility by $8.6 million in January 2018 in connection with the acquisition of an UItramax vessel. \n (2) Does not include obligations of chartered-in vessels less than one year. \n (3) On May 10, 2017, we signed an agreement to charter-in a 61,400 dwt, 2013 built Japanese vessel for approximately four years with options for two additional years. The hire rate for the first four years is $12,800 per day. \n (4) On December 19, 2017, the Company, through Ultraco, signed a memorandum of agreement to acquire a 2015 built 64,000 dwt CROWN-63 Ultramax dry bulk vessel constructed at Chengxi Shipyard Co., Ltd for $21.2 million. The Company \ntook delivery of the vessel, the New London Eagle, on January 9, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the Company paid a deposit of $2.2 million for the purchase of the vessel. The Company increased its draw down under the Ultraco Debt Facility by $8.6 million in connection with the acquisition.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures relate to the purchase of vessels and capital improvements to our vessels, which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels.\nIn addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, the Company's other major capital expenditures include funding the Company's program of regularly scheduled drydocking necessary to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Although the Company has some flexibility regarding the timing of its drydocking, the costs are relatively predictable. Management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years for vessels older than 15 years and five years for vessels younger than 15 years. Funding of these requirements is anticipated to be met with cash from operations. We anticipate that this process of recertification will require us to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities, which will reduce our available days and operating days during that period.\nDrydocking costs incurred are deferred and amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the period through the date of the next scheduled drydocking for those vessels. In 2017, three of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $2,579,111 in drydocking related costs. In 2016, nine of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $3,688,711 in drydocking related costs. In 2015, nineteen of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $11,141,561 in drydocking related costs.\nThe following table represents certain information about the estimated costs for anticipated vessel drydockings in the next four quarters, along with the anticipated off-hire days:\n\nWe have time charter contracts currently for all our vessels in the operating fleet.

report:\n\n- Eagle Bulk Shipping owns and operates a fleet of Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk vessels. As of December 31, 2017, they had 47 vessels with total carrying capacity of 2.7 million dwt.\n\n- 2017 net revenues were $236.8 million, up 90% from 2016. This increase was driven by higher charter rates and more available days due to vessel acquisitions.\n\n- In 2017, the company purchased 10 Ultramax vessels for $174.4 million and sold 4 older vessels for $26 million. They also refinanced debt, reducing debt levels and interest costs. \n\n- At December 31, 2017, total debt outstanding was $326.2 million, consisting of bonds, term loans and a revolving credit facility. Cash and equivalents were $56.3 million.\n\n- The company believes its current financial resources, together with cash from operations, will be sufficient to meet business needs and obligations over the next 12 months.\n\n- Looking ahead, the dry bulk shipping market is expected to continue improving in 2018 based on increased demand and slower fleet growth. The company aims to opportunistically grow and modernize its fleet to capitalize on the recovery.\n\nIn summary, Eagle Bulk Shipping showed strong improvement in 2017 through higher rates, vessel acquisitions and debt refinancing. The outlook is positive due to an improving dry bulk market."}
