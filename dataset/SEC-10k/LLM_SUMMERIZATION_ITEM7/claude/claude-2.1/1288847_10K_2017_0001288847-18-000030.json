Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a pioneer and leading provider of cloud software for contact centers, facilitating more than three billion interactions between our more than 2,000 clients and their customers per year. We believe we achieved this leadership position through our expertise and technology, which has empowered us to help organizations of all sizes transition from legacy on-premise contact center systems to our cloud solution. Our solution, which is comprised of our VCC cloud platform and applications, allows simultaneous management and optimization of customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile channels, either directly or through our APIs. Our VCC cloud platform routes each customer interaction to an appropriate agent resource, and delivers relevant customer data to the agent in real-time to optimize the customer experience. Unlike legacy on-premise contact center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment and can be rapidly deployed and adjusted depending on our client's requirements.\nSince founding our business in 2001, we have focused exclusively on delivering cloud contact center software. We initially targeted smaller contact center opportunities with our telesales team and, over time, invested in expanding the breadth and depth of the functionality of our cloud platform to meet the evolving requirements of our clients. In 2009, we made a strategic decision to expand our market opportunity to include larger contact centers. This decision drove further investments in research and development and the establishment of our field sales team to meet the requirements of these larger contact centers. We believe this shift has helped us diversify our client base, while significantly enhancing our opportunity for future revenue growth. To complement these efforts, we have also focused on building client awareness and driving adoption of our solution through marketing activities, which include internet advertising, digital marketing campaigns, social marketing, trade shows, industry events and telemarketing.\nWe provide our solution through a SaaS business model with recurring subscriptions. We offer a comprehensive suite of applications delivered on our VCC cloud platform that are designed to enable our clients to manage and optimize interactions across inbound and outbound contact centers. We primarily generate revenue by\nselling subscriptions and related usage of our VCC cloud platform. We charge our clients monthly subscription fees for access to our solution, primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific functionalities and applications our clients deploy. We define agent seats as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access our solution. Our clients typically have more named agents than agent seats, and multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of our clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage from us. A small percentage of our clients subscribe to our platform but purchase telephony usage directly from wholesale telecommunications service providers. We do not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes for inbound and outbound interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, where the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to our clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice. Our larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including bundled plans, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, subscription and related usage fees accounted for 94%, 95% and 96% of our revenue, respectively. The remainder was comprised of professional services revenue from the implementation and optimization of our solution.\nOur revenue increased to $200.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $162.1 million and $128.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue growth has primarily been driven by our larger clients. For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 2,000 clients across multiple industries. Our clients' subscriptions generally range in size from fewer than 10 agent seats to approximately 2,000 agent seats. We had net loss of $9.0 million, $11.9 million and $25.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe have continued to make significant expenditures and investments, including in sales and marketing, research and development and infrastructure. We primarily evaluate the success of our business based on revenue growth and the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments. The growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to expand our client base to include larger opportunities, grow revenue from our existing client base, innovate and expand internationally. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, they also pose risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. In order to pursue these opportunities, we anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term.\nDue to our continuing investments to grow our business, increase our sales and marketing efforts, pursue new opportunities, enhance our solution and build our technology, we expect our cost of revenue and operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. However, we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue and gain economies of scale by increasing our client base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers.\nKey Operating and Financial Performance Metrics\nIn addition to measures of financial performance presented in our consolidated financial statements, we monitor the key metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies.\nAnnual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\nWe believe that our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our clients, and is a measure of the long-term value of our client relationships. Our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate is calculated by dividing our Retained Net Invoicing by our Retention Base Net Invoicing on a monthly basis, which we then average using the rates for the trailing twelve months for the period being presented. We define Retention Base Net Invoicing as recurring net invoicing from all clients in the comparable prior year period, and we define Retained Net Invoicing as recurring net invoicing from that same group of clients in the current period. We define recurring net invoicing as subscription and related usage revenue excluding the impact of\nservice credits, reserves and deferrals. Historically, the difference between recurring net invoicing and our subscription and related usage revenue has been within 10%.\nThe following table shows our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate for the periods presented:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Dollar-Based Retention Rate declined from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the prior year period benefiting from the ramp of one of our largest customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe monitor adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to analyze our financial results and believe that it is useful to investors, as a supplement to U.S. GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA helps illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income or expenses that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA. Furthermore, we use this measure to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We also believe that adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from that of other companies in our industry. We compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted EBITDA through disclosure of these limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, net loss. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) interest income, expense and other, (4) provision for income taxes, and (5) other unusual items that do not directly affect what we consider to be our core operating performance.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,969\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,860\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (income) and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal settlement (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and indemnification fees related to settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reversal of interest and penalties on accrued federal fees (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reversal of accrued federal fees (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Out of period adjustment for sales tax liability (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,267\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See ITEM 6 of this Form 10-K for depreciation and amortization expenses included in our results of operations for the periods presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>See Note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for stock-based compensation expense included in our results of operations for the periods presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>See Legal Matters\u201d in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Included in general and administrative expense.

We consider our subscription and related usage to be recurring revenue. This recurring revenue includes fixed subscription fees for the delivery and support of our VCC cloud platform, as well as related usage fees. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes for inbound and outbound client interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, where the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts for our clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice.\nFixed subscription fees, including plans with bundled usage, are generally billed monthly in advance, while variable usage fees are billed in arrears. Fixed subscription fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, predominantly the monthly contractual billing period. Support activities include technical assistance for our solution and upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis, which are not billed separately. Variable subscription related usage fees for non-bundled plans are billed in arrears based on client-specific per minute rate plans and are recognized as actual usage occurs. We generally require advance deposits from clients based on estimated usage. All fees, except usage deposits, are non-refundable.\nIn addition, we generate professional services revenue from assisting clients in implementing our solution and optimizing use. These services include application configuration, system integration and education and training services. Professional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are typically performed by us directly. In limited cases, our clients choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers to perform such services. Professional services are recognized as the services are performed using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on labor hours, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.\nWe do not expect the adoption of ASC 606, the new revenue recognition guidance, in January 2018 to have a material impact on the recognition or timing of revenue. See Note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation), fees that we pay to telecommunications providers for usage, USF contributions and other regulatory costs, depreciation and related expenses of the servers and equipment, costs to build out and maintain co-location data centers, and allocated office and facility costs and amortization of acquired technology. Cost of revenue can fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the fees we pay to telecommunications providers, which vary depending on our clients' usage\nof our VCC cloud platform, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges and changes in headcount. We expect to continue investing in our network infrastructure and operations and client support function to maintain high quality and availability of service, resulting in absolute dollar increases in our cost of revenue. As our business grows, we expect to realize economies of scale in network infrastructure, personnel and client support.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses as research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for personnel related to the development of improvements and expanded features for our services, as well as quality assurance, testing, product management and allocated overhead. We expense research and development expenses as they are incurred except for internal use software development costs that qualify for capitalization. We believe that continued investment in our solution is important for our future growth, and we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for personnel in sales and marketing, sales commissions, as well as advertising, marketing, corporate communications, travel costs and allocated overhead. We currently expense sales commissions associated with the acquisition of new client contracts as incurred in the period the contract is acquired. Beginning in January 2018, we anticipate a significant amount of sales commission expense will be deferred over an expected related benefit period of five years as required by ASC 340 - Other Assets and Deferred Costs. See Note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information. We believe it is important to continue investing in sales and marketing to continue to generate revenue growth. Accordingly, while we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth initiatives, with the adoption of ASC 606 in January 2018, we also expect sales and marketing expense to decrease on our consolidated statements of operations commencing in the first quarter of 2018 due to the deferral of a significant portion of sales commissions as required by ASC 340.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for management, finance and accounting, legal, information systems and human resources personnel, professional fees, compliance costs, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that general and administrative expenses will fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period but decline as a percentage of revenue over time.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense associated with our debt and capital leases. We expect interest expense for our outstanding debt to decrease due to a lower interest rate for our new revolving credit facility compared to the 2014 loan and security agreement and the 2013 loan and security agreement (see Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report). We expect interest expense for our capital leases to increase as a result of our continued capital spending funded by capital leases.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes consists primarily of corporate income taxes resulting from profits generated in foreign jurisdictions by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, along with state income taxes payable in the United States. We do not expect the new legislation signed into law by President Trump in December 2017 to have a significant impact on our future income tax provision. See Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nBased on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss set forth in this annual report, the following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$200,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$162,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$38,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in revenue for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to our larger clients, driven by an increase in our sales and marketing activities and our improved brand awareness.

See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. The increase was also driven by a $2.5 million increase in third party hosted software costs, a $1.9 million increase in data center costs, and a $0.9 million\nincrease in USF contributions and other federal telecommunication service fees, all of which were due primarily to increased client activities. The $1.5 million increase in facility-related and overhead allocation costs also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue.\nGross Profit\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$117,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$95,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$21,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross profit for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in subscription and higher amounts charged for, and better efficiencies in, professional services.

The loss was comprised of $0.4 million in prepayment penalties, a $0.4 million write-off of unamortized debt discounts, and a $0.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. This increase was partially offset by lower interest expense related to lower interest rates under the 2016 Loan and Security Agreement compared to the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have financed our operations, primarily through sales of our solution, lease facilities and net proceeds from our equity and debt financings. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $68.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $32.6 million outstanding under our New Revolving Credit Facility as described in the following. On August 1, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement ( 2016 Loan and Security Agreement\u201d) with two lenders for a new revolving credit facility ( New Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $50.0 million. The New Revolving Credit Facility matures August 1, 2019. Under the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility, the balance outstanding cannot exceed our trailing four months of MRR (monthly recurring revenue including subscription and usage) multiplied by the average trailing 12 month dollar based retention rate (calculated on the same basis as set forth in Item 7 of this report, see Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\u201d). The New Revolving Credit Facility carries a variable annual interest rate of the prime rate plus 0.50%, subject to a 0.25% increase if our adjusted EBITDA is negative at the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, we are required to maintain $25.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents deposited with two lenders in connection with our 2016 Loan and Security Agreement. See Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. As of December 31, 2017, the amount available for additional borrowings was $17.4 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and the amount available for borrowing under our New Revolving Credit Facility (or any refinancing of the facility) will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, continuing market acceptance of our solution, client retention, our ability to gain new clients, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the outcome of any pending or future litigation or other claims by third parties or governmental entities, the expansion of sales and marketing activities and the introduction of new and enhanced offerings. We may also acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies and intellectual property rights, which may increase our future capital requirements, both to pay acquisition costs and to support our combined operations. We may raise additional equity or debt financing at any time. We may not be able to raise additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired or required, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, if our operating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we will be subject to increased debt service obligations and could also be subject to new or additional restrictive covenants and other operating restrictions that could harm our ability to conduct our business.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,650\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,397\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,803\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,556\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(362\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by or used in operating activities is primarily influenced by our personnel-related expenditures, data center and telecommunications carrier costs, office and facility related costs, USF contributions and other regulatory costs and the amount and timing of client payments. Our largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our clients for subscription and related usage services. Payments from clients for our solutions and usage services are typically received monthly. If we continue to improve our financial results, we expect net cash provided by operating activities to increase.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.1 million compared to $6.8 million for the same period of 2016. The increase of $4.3 million was primarily due to an $8.0 million favorable impact from a decrease in net loss after adjusting for non-cash expenses, offset by a $3.7 million decrease in net cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash outflows during 2017 included total payments of $1.8 million for settlement, legal and indemnification fees related to the Melcher litigation. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1.3 million compared to cash inflows of $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. This unfavorable change was primarily due to a $1.8 million unfavorable change in accounts receivable driven by increased sales, a $1.1 million unfavorable change in prepaid expenses and other current assets mainly due to higher deferred cost of revenue, and a $1.2 million unfavorable change in accrued and other current liabilities primarily related to accrued cash-based personnel-related cost driven by headcount and the timing of payments for accrued liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.8 million compared to net cash used of $12.9 million for the same period of 2015. The $19.8 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $14.6 million favorable impact from a decrease in net loss after adjusting for non-cash expenses and a $5.2 million favorable change in net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2.4 million compared to cash outflows of $2.8 million for the same period in 2015, resulted in an overall improvement of $5.2 million. This improvement was primarily due to a $2.6 million favorable change in deferred revenue mainly attributable to increased billings, $2.4 million favorable change in accounts payable related to timing of payments, and $1.8 million favorable change in accrued and other current liabilities primarily due to employee paid-time off, sales commissions and bonus, driven by our improved sales and financial performance and increased headcount. This improvement was offset in part primarily by an unfavorable change of $1.0 million in accounts receivable due to increased sales.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. The 0.3 million increase in cash used was primarily driven by the $1.5 million increase in purchase of property and equipment, offset primarily by our purchase of $1.2 million in convertible notes held for investment in 2016. Our most significant capital expenditures have been investments in our software and equipment for our data centers. We expect such capital investment will continue in the future to support our expected growth.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $22.1 million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by our 2015 activities, including the proceeds of $40.0 million received in 2015 from the maturity of our short-term investments, $0.8 million release in restricted cash in 2015 due to the release of two letters of credit related to our office lease obligation and an insurance policy, offset in part by the $20.0 million purchase of short-term investments in 2015. The purchase of $1.2 million in convertible notes held for investment in 2016 also contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in 2016.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used of $4.8 million for the same period in 2016. This $7.2 million favorable change was primarily driven by a $1.7 million increase in cash received from stock option exercises in 2017, a $2.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan in 2017, and our debt refinancing activities in 2016 including the $36.9 million repayments on notes payable and revolving line of credit as part of our cancellation of the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement, offset in part by the cash received from the $32.6 million drawdown under our New Revolving Credit Facility in 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $1.8 million favorable change was primarily driven by the $3.0 million increase in cash received from stock option exercises, a $0.6 million increase in cash received from the\nsale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, and by our 2016 debt refinancing activities including the cash received from the $32.6 million drawdown in 2016 under our New Revolving Credit Facility, offset in part by the repayments of $36.9 million in notes payable and our revolving line of credit as part of our cancellation of the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement during 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8, Note 1, of this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue consists of subscription services and related usage as well as professional services. We charge clients monthly subscription fees for access to our VCC solution. Monthly subscription fees are primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific VCC functionalities and applications deployed by the client. Agent seats are defined as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access the VCC cloud platform. Clients typically have more named agents than agent seats. Multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of our clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage. A small percentage of our clients subscribe to our platform but purchase telephony usage directly from a wholesale telecommunications service provider. We do not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes used for inbound and outbound customer interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments whereby the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. Professional services revenue is derived primarily from implementations, including application configuration, system integration, optimization, education and training services. Clients are not permitted to take possession of our software.\nWe offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats and sometimes with a minimum number of agent seats requirement. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice. Larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including plans bundled with usage, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. Support activities include technical assistance and upgrades and enhancements to our solution on a when-and-if-available basis, which are not billed separately.\nWe generally require advance deposits from our clients based on estimated usage. Fees for certain clients' usage are applied against the advance deposit resulting in continuous consumption and requiring frequent replenishment of the deposit. Any unused portion of the deposit is refundable to the client upon termination of the arrangement, provided all amounts due have been paid. All fees, except usage deposits, are non-refundable.\nProfessional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by us directly or, alternatively, clients may also choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers.\nOur sales arrangements generally involve multiple deliverables, including subscription services and related usage as well as professional services, all of which have standalone value to the client. We allocate arrangement consideration to these deliverables based on the relative standalone selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE\u201d) if available; (ii) Third Party Evidence ( TPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available; and (iii) Best Estimate of Selling Price ( BESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nVSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element to\neither the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately. We have not met the criteria to establish selling prices based on VSOE.\nTPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Our services are significantly differentiated such that the comparable pricing of deliverables with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine the standalone selling prices of similar deliverables sold by competitors. As a result, we have not met the criteria to establish selling prices based on TPE.\nBESP. Since we are unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, pricing policies, market conditions, and competitive landscape. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables.\nWe recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria have been met:\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>delivery has occurred;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fee is fixed or determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>collection is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Revenue allocated to the separate accounting units is recognized as follows:\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fixed subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, predominantly the monthly contractual billing period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>variable usage revenue is recognized as actual usage occurs. Usage revenue in subscription arrangements that include bundled usage is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, as the Company cannot reliably estimate client usage patterns; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on labor hours, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> At the time of each revenue transaction, we assess whether fees under the arrangement are fixed or determinable and whether collection is probable. For arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue as these amounts become due and payable. We assess collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the client. If we determine that collection of fees is not reasonably assured, we defer the revenue and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment. We maintain a revenue reserve for potential credits to be issued in accordance with service level agreements or for other revenue adjustments.\nSignificant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. Generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. Key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer which may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added and excise taxes. We record USF contributions and other regulatory costs on a gross basis in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and record surcharges and sales, use and excise taxes billed to our clients on a net basis. The cost of gross USF contributions payable to USAC and\nsuppliers is presented as a cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Surcharges and sales, use and excise taxes incurred in excess of amounts billed to our clients are presented in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nContractual Obligations\nCommitments\nOur principal contractual obligations consist of future payment obligations under debt, capital leases to finance data centers and other computer and networking equipment, operating leases for office space, research and development, and sales and marketing facilities, and agreements with third parties to provide co-location hosting, telecommunication usage and equipment maintenance services.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands).\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving line of credit (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hosting services (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Telecommunication usage (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment maintenance (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the outstanding principal balance under a promissory note with USAC.

Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify clients, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. Other than as described below, there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOn October 27, 2016, we received notice from Lance Fried, a former officer and director of Face It, of his claim for indemnification by us (as successor in interest to Face It), and for advancement of all legal fees and expenses he incurs in connection with the defense of the Melcher litigation. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K for detail. As of May 31, 2017, we had advanced Mr. Fried $62 thousand in connection with this claim. However, we dispute that Mr. Fried is entitled to advancement in connection with the Melcher Litigation. On July 31, 2017, Mr. Fried filed a complaint against us in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, in which he alleges that we breached advancement obligations to him. In the lawsuit, Mr. Fried seeks advancement of his legal fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the Melcher litigation, payment of his legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with his advancement action, and interest. We believe the action is without merit and are defending against it vigorously. On December 7, 2017, the Delaware Chancery Court stayed Mr. Fried's advancement lawsuit, in favor of arbitration. On January 9, 2018, we received Mr. Fried's demand for arbitration against us with respect to the same matter. Regardless of the outcome of Mr. Fried's advancement action against us, Mr. Fried is required to reimburse us for any amounts advanced to him if it is ultimately determined that Mr. Fried is not entitled to indemnification in connection with the Melcher litigation. In addition, we believe we have indemnification rights against the former stockholders of Face It (including Mr. Fried) for all losses that are incurred by us in connection with the Melcher litigation, including without limitation, amounts incurred to indemnify or advance the legal fees and expenses of Mr. Fried pursuant to his indemnification claim against us.\nContingencies - Legal and Regulatory\nWe are subject to certain legal and regulatory proceedings, and from time to time may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings relating to contractual disputes, intellectual property rights, employment matters, regulatory compliance matters, and other litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of business. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing specific litigation and regulatory matters using reasonably available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel, which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes, assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies. Legal fees are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K for details.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a pioneer and leading provider of cloud software for contact centers, facilitating more than three billion interactions between our more than 2,000 clients and their customers per year. We believe we achieved this leadership position through our expertise and technology, which has empowered us to help organizations of all sizes transition from legacy on-premise contact center systems to our cloud solution. Our solution, which is comprised of our VCC cloud platform and applications, allows simultaneous management and optimization of customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile channels, either directly or through our APIs. Our VCC cloud platform routes each customer interaction to an appropriate agent resource, and delivers relevant customer data to the agent in real-time to optimize the customer experience. Unlike legacy on-premise contact center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment and can be rapidly deployed and adjusted depending on our client's requirements.\nSince founding our business in 2001, we have focused exclusively on delivering cloud contact center software. We initially targeted smaller contact center opportunities with our telesales team and, over time, invested in expanding the breadth and depth of the functionality of our cloud platform to meet the evolving requirements of our clients. In 2009, we made a strategic decision to expand our market opportunity to include larger contact centers. This decision drove further investments in research and development and the establishment of our field sales team to meet the requirements of these larger contact centers. We believe this shift has helped us diversify our client base, while significantly enhancing our opportunity for future revenue growth. To complement these efforts, we have also focused on building client awareness and driving adoption of our solution through marketing activities, which include internet advertising, digital marketing campaigns, social marketing, trade shows, industry events and telemarketing.\nWe provide our solution through a SaaS business model with recurring subscriptions. We offer a comprehensive suite of applications delivered on our VCC cloud platform that are designed to enable our clients to manage and optimize interactions across inbound and outbound contact centers. We primarily generate revenue by\nselling subscriptions and related usage of our VCC cloud platform. We charge our clients monthly subscription fees for access to our solution, primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific functionalities and applications our clients deploy. We define agent seats as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access our solution. Our clients typically have more named agents than agent seats, and multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of our clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage from us. A small percentage of our clients subscribe to our platform but purchase telephony usage directly from wholesale telecommunications service providers. We do not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes for inbound and outbound interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, where the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to our clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice. Our larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including bundled plans, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, subscription and related usage fees accounted for 94%, 95% and 96% of our revenue, respectively. The remainder was comprised of professional services revenue from the implementation and optimization of our solution.\nOur revenue increased to $200.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $162.1 million and $128.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue growth has primarily been driven by our larger clients. For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 2,000 clients across multiple industries. Our clients' subscriptions generally range in size from fewer than 10 agent seats to approximately 2,000 agent seats. We had net loss of $9.0 million, $11.9 million and $25.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe have continued to make significant expenditures and investments, including in sales and marketing, research and development and infrastructure. We primarily evaluate the success of our business based on revenue growth and the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments. The growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to expand our client base to include larger opportunities, grow revenue from our existing client base, innovate and expand internationally. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, they also pose risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. In order to pursue these opportunities, we anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term.\nDue to our continuing investments to grow our business, increase our sales and marketing efforts, pursue new opportunities, enhance our solution and build our technology, we expect our cost of revenue and operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. However, we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue and gain economies of scale by increasing our client base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers.\nKey Operating and Financial Performance Metrics\nIn addition to measures of financial performance presented in our consolidated financial statements, we monitor the key metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies.\nAnnual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\nWe believe that our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our clients, and is a measure of the long-term value of our client relationships. Our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate is calculated by dividing our Retained Net Invoicing by our Retention Base Net Invoicing on a monthly basis, which we then average using the rates for the trailing twelve months for the period being presented. We define Retention Base Net Invoicing as recurring net invoicing from all clients in the comparable prior year period, and we define Retained Net Invoicing as recurring net invoicing from that same group of clients in the current period. We define recurring net invoicing as subscription and related usage revenue excluding the impact of\nservice credits, reserves and deferrals. Historically, the difference between recurring net invoicing and our subscription and related usage revenue has been within 10%.\nThe following table shows our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate for the periods presented:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Dollar-Based Retention Rate declined from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the prior year period benefiting from the ramp of one of our largest customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe monitor adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to analyze our financial results and believe that it is useful to investors, as a supplement to U.S. GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA helps illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income or expenses that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA. Furthermore, we use this measure to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We also believe that adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from that of other companies in our industry. We compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted EBITDA through disclosure of these limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, net loss. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) interest income, expense and other, (4) provision for income taxes, and (5) other unusual items that do not directly affect what we consider to be our core operating performance.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,969\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,860\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (income) and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal settlement (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and indemnification fees related to settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reversal of interest and penalties on accrued federal fees (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reversal of accrued federal fees (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Out of period adjustment for sales tax liability (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,267\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See ITEM 6 of this Form 10-K for depreciation and amortization expenses included in our results of operations for the periods presented. \n (2) See Note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for stock-based compensation expense included in our results of operations for the periods presented. \n (3) See Legal Matters\u201d in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n (4) Included in general and administrative expense.

The 2015 amount represents immaterial out of period adjustments recorded in the first two quarters of 2015 for 2011 through 2014. \nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of subscription and related usage as well as professional services. We consider our subscription and related usage to be recurring revenue. This recurring revenue includes fixed subscription fees for the delivery and support of our VCC cloud platform, as well as related usage fees. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes for inbound and outbound client interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, where the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts for our clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice.\nFixed subscription fees, including plans with bundled usage, are generally billed monthly in advance, while variable usage fees are billed in arrears. Fixed subscription fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, predominantly the monthly contractual billing period. Support activities include technical assistance for our solution and upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis, which are not billed separately. Variable subscription related usage fees for non-bundled plans are billed in arrears based on client-specific per minute rate plans and are recognized as actual usage occurs. We generally require advance deposits from clients based on estimated usage. All fees, except usage deposits, are non-refundable.\nIn addition, we generate professional services revenue from assisting clients in implementing our solution and optimizing use. These services include application configuration, system integration and education and training services. Professional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are typically performed by us directly. In limited cases, our clients choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers to perform such services. Professional services are recognized as the services are performed using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on labor hours, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.\nWe do not expect the adoption of ASC 606, the new revenue recognition guidance, in January 2018 to have a material impact on the recognition or timing of revenue. See Note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation), fees that we pay to telecommunications providers for usage, USF contributions and other regulatory costs, depreciation and related expenses of the servers and equipment, costs to build out and maintain co-location data centers, and allocated office and facility costs and amortization of acquired technology. Cost of revenue can fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the fees we pay to telecommunications providers, which vary depending on our clients' usage\nof our VCC cloud platform, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges and changes in headcount. We expect to continue investing in our network infrastructure and operations and client support function to maintain high quality and availability of service, resulting in absolute dollar increases in our cost of revenue. As our business grows, we expect to realize economies of scale in network infrastructure, personnel and client support.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses as research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for personnel related to the development of improvements and expanded features for our services, as well as quality assurance, testing, product management and allocated overhead. We expense research and development expenses as they are incurred except for internal use software development costs that qualify for capitalization. We believe that continued investment in our solution is important for our future growth, and we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for personnel in sales and marketing, sales commissions, as well as advertising, marketing, corporate communications, travel costs and allocated overhead. We currently expense sales commissions associated with the acquisition of new client contracts as incurred in the period the contract is acquired. Beginning in January 2018, we anticipate a significant amount of sales commission expense will be deferred over an expected related benefit period of five years as required by ASC 340 - Other Assets and Deferred Costs. See Note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information. We believe it is important to continue investing in sales and marketing to continue to generate revenue growth. Accordingly, while we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth initiatives, with the adoption of ASC 606 in January 2018, we also expect sales and marketing expense to decrease on our consolidated statements of operations commencing in the first quarter of 2018 due to the deferral of a significant portion of sales commissions as required by ASC 340.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for management, finance and accounting, legal, information systems and human resources personnel, professional fees, compliance costs, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that general and administrative expenses will fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period but decline as a percentage of revenue over time.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense associated with our debt and capital leases. We expect interest expense for our outstanding debt to decrease due to a lower interest rate for our new revolving credit facility compared to the 2014 loan and security agreement and the 2013 loan and security agreement (see Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report). We expect interest expense for our capital leases to increase as a result of our continued capital spending funded by capital leases.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes consists primarily of corporate income taxes resulting from profits generated in foreign jurisdictions by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, along with state income taxes payable in the United States. We do not expect the new legislation signed into law by President Trump in December 2017 to have a significant impact on our future income tax provision. See Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nBased on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss set forth in this annual report, the following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$200,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$162,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$38,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in revenue for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to our larger clients, driven by an increase in our sales and marketing activities and our improved brand awareness.

See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. The increase was also driven by a $2.5 million increase in third party hosted software costs, a $1.9 million increase in data center costs, and a $0.9 million\nincrease in USF contributions and other federal telecommunication service fees, all of which were due primarily to increased client activities.

The loss was comprised of $0.4 million in prepayment penalties, a $0.4 million write-off of unamortized debt discounts, and a $0.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. This increase was partially offset by lower interest expense related to lower interest rates under the 2016 Loan and Security Agreement compared to the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have financed our operations, primarily through sales of our solution, lease facilities and net proceeds from our equity and debt financings. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $68.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $32.6 million outstanding under our New Revolving Credit Facility as described in the following. On August 1, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement ( 2016 Loan and Security Agreement\u201d) with two lenders for a new revolving credit facility ( New Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $50.0 million. The New Revolving Credit Facility matures August 1, 2019. Under the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility, the balance outstanding cannot exceed our trailing four months of MRR (monthly recurring revenue including subscription and usage) multiplied by the average trailing 12 month dollar based retention rate (calculated on the same basis as set forth in Item 7 of this report, see Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\u201d). The New Revolving Credit Facility carries a variable annual interest rate of the prime rate plus 0.50%, subject to a 0.25% increase if our adjusted EBITDA is negative at the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, we are required to maintain $25.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents deposited with two lenders in connection with our 2016 Loan and Security Agreement. See Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. As of December 31, 2017, the amount available for additional borrowings was $17.4 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and the amount available for borrowing under our New Revolving Credit Facility (or any refinancing of the facility) will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, continuing market acceptance of our solution, client retention, our ability to gain new clients, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the outcome of any pending or future litigation or other claims by third parties or governmental entities, the expansion of sales and marketing activities and the introduction of new and enhanced offerings. We may also acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies and intellectual property rights, which may increase our future capital requirements, both to pay acquisition costs and to support our combined operations. We may raise additional equity or debt financing at any time. We may not be able to raise additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired or required, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, if our operating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we will be subject to increased debt service obligations and could also be subject to new or additional restrictive covenants and other operating restrictions that could harm our ability to conduct our business.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,650\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,397\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,803\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,556\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(362\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by or used in operating activities is primarily influenced by our personnel-related expenditures, data center and telecommunications carrier costs, office and facility related costs, USF contributions and other regulatory costs and the amount and timing of client payments. Our largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our clients for subscription and related usage services. Payments from clients for our solutions and usage services are typically received monthly. If we continue to improve our financial results, we expect net cash provided by operating activities to increase.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.1 million compared to $6.8 million for the same period of 2016. The increase of $4.3 million was primarily due to an $8.0 million favorable impact from a decrease in net loss after adjusting for non-cash expenses, offset by a $3.7 million decrease in net cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash outflows during 2017 included total payments of $1.8 million for settlement, legal and indemnification fees related to the Melcher litigation. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1.3 million compared to cash inflows of $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. This unfavorable change was primarily due to a $1.8 million unfavorable change in accounts receivable driven by increased sales, a $1.1 million unfavorable change in prepaid expenses and other current assets mainly due to higher deferred cost of revenue, and a $1.2 million unfavorable change in accrued and other current liabilities primarily related to accrued cash-based personnel-related cost driven by headcount and the timing of payments for accrued liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.8 million compared to net cash used of $12.9 million for the same period of 2015. The $19.8 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $14.6 million favorable impact from a decrease in net loss after adjusting for non-cash expenses and a $5.2 million favorable change in net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2.4 million compared to cash outflows of $2.8 million for the same period in 2015, resulted in an overall improvement of $5.2 million. This improvement was primarily due to a $2.6 million favorable change in deferred revenue mainly attributable to increased billings, $2.4 million favorable change in accounts payable related to timing of payments, and $1.8 million favorable change in accrued and other current liabilities primarily due to employee paid-time off, sales commissions and bonus, driven by our improved sales and financial performance and increased headcount. This improvement was offset in part primarily by an unfavorable change of $1.0 million in accounts receivable due to increased sales.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. The 0.3 million increase in cash used was primarily driven by the $1.5 million increase in purchase of property and equipment, offset primarily by our purchase of $1.2 million in convertible notes held for investment in 2016. Our most significant capital expenditures have been investments in our software and equipment for our data centers. We expect such capital investment will continue in the future to support our expected growth.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $22.1 million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by our 2015 activities, including the proceeds of $40.0 million received in 2015 from the maturity of our short-term investments, $0.8 million release in restricted cash in 2015 due to the release of two letters of credit related to our office lease obligation and an insurance policy, offset in part by the $20.0 million purchase of short-term investments in 2015. The purchase of $1.2 million in convertible notes held for investment in 2016 also contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in 2016.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used of $4.8 million for the same period in 2016. This $7.2 million favorable change was primarily driven by a $1.7 million increase in cash received from stock option exercises in 2017, a $2.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan in 2017, and our debt refinancing activities in 2016 including the $36.9 million repayments on notes payable and revolving line of credit as part of our cancellation of the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement, offset in part by the cash received from the $32.6 million drawdown under our New Revolving Credit Facility in 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $1.8 million favorable change was primarily driven by the $3.0 million increase in cash received from stock option exercises, a $0.6 million increase in cash received from the\nsale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, and by our 2016 debt refinancing activities including the cash received from the $32.6 million drawdown in 2016 under our New Revolving Credit Facility, offset in part by the repayments of $36.9 million in notes payable and our revolving line of credit as part of our cancellation of the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement during 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8, Note 1, of this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue consists of subscription services and related usage as well as professional services. We charge clients monthly subscription fees for access to our VCC solution. Monthly subscription fees are primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific VCC functionalities and applications deployed by the client. Agent seats are defined as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access the VCC cloud platform. Clients typically have more named agents than agent seats. Multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of our clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage. A small percentage of our clients subscribe to our platform but purchase telephony usage directly from a wholesale telecommunications service provider. We do not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes used for inbound and outbound customer interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments whereby the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. Professional services revenue is derived primarily from implementations, including application configuration, system integration, optimization, education and training services. Clients are not permitted to take possession of our software.\nWe offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats and sometimes with a minimum number of agent seats requirement. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice. Larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including plans bundled with usage, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. Support activities include technical assistance and upgrades and enhancements to our solution on a when-and-if-available basis, which are not billed separately.\nWe generally require advance deposits from our clients based on estimated usage. Fees for certain clients' usage are applied against the advance deposit resulting in continuous consumption and requiring frequent replenishment of the deposit. Any unused portion of the deposit is refundable to the client upon termination of the arrangement, provided all amounts due have been paid. All fees, except usage deposits, are non-refundable.\nProfessional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by us directly or, alternatively, clients may also choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers.\nOur sales arrangements generally involve multiple deliverables, including subscription services and related usage as well as professional services, all of which have standalone value to the client. We allocate arrangement consideration to these deliverables based on the relative standalone selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE\u201d) if available; (ii) Third Party Evidence ( TPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available; and (iii) Best Estimate of Selling Price ( BESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nVSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element to\neither the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately. We have not met the criteria to establish selling prices based on VSOE.\nTPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Our services are significantly differentiated such that the comparable pricing of deliverables with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine the standalone selling prices of similar deliverables sold by competitors. As a result, we have not met the criteria to establish selling prices based on TPE.\nBESP. Since we are unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, pricing policies, market conditions, and competitive landscape. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables.\nWe recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria have been met:\n \u2022 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u2022 delivery has occurred; \n \u2022 the fee is fixed or determinable; and \n \u2022 collection is reasonably assured.  Revenue allocated to the separate accounting units is recognized as follows:\n \u2022 fixed subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, predominantly the monthly contractual billing period; \n \u2022 variable usage revenue is recognized as actual usage occurs. Usage revenue in subscription arrangements that include bundled usage is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, as the Company cannot reliably estimate client usage patterns; and \n \u2022 professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on labor hours, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  At the time of each revenue transaction, we assess whether fees under the arrangement are fixed or determinable and whether collection is probable. For arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue as these amounts become due and payable. We assess collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the client. If we determine that collection of fees is not reasonably assured, we defer the revenue and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment. We maintain a revenue reserve for potential credits to be issued in accordance with service level agreements or for other revenue adjustments.\nSignificant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. Generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. Key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer which may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added and excise taxes. We record USF contributions and other regulatory costs on a gross basis in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and record surcharges and sales, use and excise taxes billed to our clients on a net basis. The cost of gross USF contributions payable to USAC and\nsuppliers is presented as a cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Surcharges and sales, use and excise taxes incurred in excess of amounts billed to our clients are presented in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nContractual Obligations\nCommitments\nOur principal contractual obligations consist of future payment obligations under debt, capital leases to finance data centers and other computer and networking equipment, operating leases for office space, research and development, and sales and marketing facilities, and agreements with third parties to provide co-location hosting, telecommunication usage and equipment maintenance services.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands).\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving line of credit (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hosting services (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Telecommunication usage (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment maintenance (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the outstanding principal balance under a promissory note with USAC.

Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify clients, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. Other than as described below, there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOn October 27, 2016, we received notice from Lance Fried, a former officer and director of Face It, of his claim for indemnification by us (as successor in interest to Face It), and for advancement of all legal fees and expenses he incurs in connection with the defense of the Melcher litigation. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K for detail. As of May 31, 2017, we had advanced Mr. Fried $62 thousand in connection with this claim. However, we dispute that Mr. Fried is entitled to advancement in connection with the Melcher Litigation. On July 31, 2017, Mr. Fried filed a complaint against us in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, in which he alleges that we breached advancement obligations to him. In the lawsuit, Mr. Fried seeks advancement of his legal fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the Melcher litigation, payment of his legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with his advancement action, and interest. We believe the action is without merit and are defending against it vigorously. On December 7, 2017, the Delaware Chancery Court stayed Mr. Fried's advancement lawsuit, in favor of arbitration. On January 9, 2018, we received Mr. Fried's demand for arbitration against us with respect to the same matter. Regardless of the outcome of Mr. Fried's advancement action against us, Mr. Fried is required to reimburse us for any amounts advanced to him if it is ultimately determined that Mr. Fried is not entitled to indemnification in connection with the Melcher litigation. In addition, we believe we have indemnification rights against the former stockholders of Face It (including Mr. Fried) for all losses that are incurred by us in connection with the Melcher litigation, including without limitation, amounts incurred to indemnify or advance the legal fees and expenses of Mr. Fried pursuant to his indemnification claim against us.\nContingencies - Legal and Regulatory\nWe are subject to certain legal and regulatory proceedings, and from time to time may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings relating to contractual disputes, intellectual property rights, employment matters, regulatory compliance matters, and other litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of business. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing specific litigation and regulatory matters using reasonably available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel, which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes, assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies. Legal fees are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K for details.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a pioneer and leading provider of cloud software for contact centers, facilitating more than three billion interactions between our more than 2,000 clients and their customers per year. We believe we achieved this leadership position through our expertise and technology, which has empowered us to help organizations of all sizes transition from legacy on-premise contact center systems to our cloud solution. Our solution, which is comprised of our VCC cloud platform and applications, allows simultaneous management and optimization of customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile channels, either directly or through our APIs. Our VCC cloud platform routes each customer interaction to an appropriate agent resource, and delivers relevant customer data to the agent in real-time to optimize the customer experience. Unlike legacy on-premise contact center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment and can be rapidly deployed and adjusted depending on our client's requirements.\nSince founding our business in 2001, we have focused exclusively on delivering cloud contact center software. We initially targeted smaller contact center opportunities with our telesales team and, over time, invested in expanding the breadth and depth of the functionality of our cloud platform to meet the evolving requirements of our clients. In 2009, we made a strategic decision to expand our market opportunity to include larger contact centers. This decision drove further investments in research and development and the establishment of our field sales team to meet the requirements of these larger contact centers. We believe this shift has helped us diversify our client base, while significantly enhancing our opportunity for future revenue growth. To complement these efforts, we have also focused on building client awareness and driving adoption of our solution through marketing activities, which include internet advertising, digital marketing campaigns, social marketing, trade shows, industry events and telemarketing.\nWe provide our solution through a SaaS business model with recurring subscriptions. We offer a comprehensive suite of applications delivered on our VCC cloud platform that are designed to enable our clients to manage and optimize interactions across inbound and outbound contact centers. We primarily generate revenue by\nselling subscriptions and related usage of our VCC cloud platform. We charge our clients monthly subscription fees for access to our solution, primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific functionalities and applications our clients deploy. We define agent seats as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access our solution. Our clients typically have more named agents than agent seats, and multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of our clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage from us. A small percentage of our clients subscribe to our platform but purchase telephony usage directly from wholesale telecommunications service providers. We do not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes for inbound and outbound interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, where the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to our clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice. Our larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including bundled plans, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, subscription and related usage fees accounted for 94%, 95% and 96% of our revenue, respectively. The remainder was comprised of professional services revenue from the implementation and optimization of our solution.\nOur revenue increased to $200.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $162.1 million and $128.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue growth has primarily been driven by our larger clients. For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 2,000 clients across multiple industries. Our clients' subscriptions generally range in size from fewer than 10 agent seats to approximately 2,000 agent seats. We had net loss of $9.0 million, $11.9 million and $25.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe have continued to make significant expenditures and investments, including in sales and marketing, research and development and infrastructure. We primarily evaluate the success of our business based on revenue growth and the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments. The growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to expand our client base to include larger opportunities, grow revenue from our existing client base, innovate and expand internationally. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, they also pose risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. In order to pursue these opportunities, we anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term.\nDue to our continuing investments to grow our business, increase our sales and marketing efforts, pursue new opportunities, enhance our solution and build our technology, we expect our cost of revenue and operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. However, we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue and gain economies of scale by increasing our client base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers.\nKey Operating and Financial Performance Metrics\nIn addition to measures of financial performance presented in our consolidated financial statements, we monitor the key metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies.\nAnnual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\nWe believe that our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our clients, and is a measure of the long-term value of our client relationships. Our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate is calculated by dividing our Retained Net Invoicing by our Retention Base Net Invoicing on a monthly basis, which we then average using the rates for the trailing twelve months for the period being presented. We define Retention Base Net Invoicing as recurring net invoicing from all clients in the comparable prior year period, and we define Retained Net Invoicing as recurring net invoicing from that same group of clients in the current period. We define recurring net invoicing as subscription and related usage revenue excluding the impact of\nservice credits, reserves and deferrals. Historically, the difference between recurring net invoicing and our subscription and related usage revenue has been within 10%.\nThe following table shows our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate for the periods presented:\n\nOur Dollar-Based Retention Rate declined from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the prior year period benefiting from the ramp of one of our largest customers.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe monitor adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to analyze our financial results and believe that it is useful to investors, as a supplement to U.S. GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA helps illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income or expenses that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA. Furthermore, we use this measure to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We also believe that adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from that of other companies in our industry. We compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted EBITDA through disclosure of these limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, net loss. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) interest income, expense and other, (4) provision for income taxes, and (5) other unusual items that do not directly affect what we consider to be our core operating performance.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\n (1) See ITEM 6 of this Form 10-K for depreciation and amortization expenses included in our results of operations for the periods presented. \n (2) See Note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for stock-based compensation expense included in our results of operations for the periods presented. \n (3) See Legal Matters\u201d in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n (4) Included in general and administrative expense. Amount represents the reversal of accrued interest and penalties related to the Universal Services Fund (\"USF\") liability following a favorable ruling from the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau. See Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n (5) Included in cost of revenue. Amount represents a credit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 following a favorable ruling from the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau. See Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K. \n (6) Included in general and administrative expense. The 2015 amount represents immaterial out of period adjustments recorded in the first two quarters of 2015 for 2011 through 2014. \nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of subscription and related usage as well as professional services. We consider our subscription and related usage to be recurring revenue. This recurring revenue includes fixed subscription fees for the delivery and support of our VCC cloud platform, as well as related usage fees. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes for inbound and outbound client interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, where the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts for our clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice.\nFixed subscription fees, including plans with bundled usage, are generally billed monthly in advance, while variable usage fees are billed in arrears. Fixed subscription fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, predominantly the monthly contractual billing period. Support activities include technical assistance for our solution and upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis, which are not billed separately. Variable subscription related usage fees for non-bundled plans are billed in arrears based on client-specific per minute rate plans and are recognized as actual usage occurs. We generally require advance deposits from clients based on estimated usage. All fees, except usage deposits, are non-refundable.\nIn addition, we generate professional services revenue from assisting clients in implementing our solution and optimizing use. These services include application configuration, system integration and education and training services. Professional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are typically performed by us directly. In limited cases, our clients choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers to perform such services. Professional services are recognized as the services are performed using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on labor hours, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.\nWe do not expect the adoption of ASC 606, the new revenue recognition guidance, in January 2018 to have a material impact on the recognition or timing of revenue. See Note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation), fees that we pay to telecommunications providers for usage, USF contributions and other regulatory costs, depreciation and related expenses of the servers and equipment, costs to build out and maintain co-location data centers, and allocated office and facility costs and amortization of acquired technology. Cost of revenue can fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the fees we pay to telecommunications providers, which vary depending on our clients' usage\nof our VCC cloud platform, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges and changes in headcount. We expect to continue investing in our network infrastructure and operations and client support function to maintain high quality and availability of service, resulting in absolute dollar increases in our cost of revenue. As our business grows, we expect to realize economies of scale in network infrastructure, personnel and client support.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses as research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for personnel related to the development of improvements and expanded features for our services, as well as quality assurance, testing, product management and allocated overhead. We expense research and development expenses as they are incurred except for internal use software development costs that qualify for capitalization. We believe that continued investment in our solution is important for our future growth, and we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for personnel in sales and marketing, sales commissions, as well as advertising, marketing, corporate communications, travel costs and allocated overhead. We currently expense sales commissions associated with the acquisition of new client contracts as incurred in the period the contract is acquired. Beginning in January 2018, we anticipate a significant amount of sales commission expense will be deferred over an expected related benefit period of five years as required by ASC 340 - Other Assets and Deferred Costs. See Note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information. We believe it is important to continue investing in sales and marketing to continue to generate revenue growth. Accordingly, while we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth initiatives, with the adoption of ASC 606 in January 2018, we also expect sales and marketing expense to decrease on our consolidated statements of operations commencing in the first quarter of 2018 due to the deferral of a significant portion of sales commissions as required by ASC 340.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for management, finance and accounting, legal, information systems and human resources personnel, professional fees, compliance costs, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that general and administrative expenses will fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period but decline as a percentage of revenue over time.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense associated with our debt and capital leases. We expect interest expense for our outstanding debt to decrease due to a lower interest rate for our new revolving credit facility compared to the 2014 loan and security agreement and the 2013 loan and security agreement (see Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report). We expect interest expense for our capital leases to increase as a result of our continued capital spending funded by capital leases.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes consists primarily of corporate income taxes resulting from profits generated in foreign jurisdictions by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, along with state income taxes payable in the United States. We do not expect the new legislation signed into law by President Trump in December 2017 to have a significant impact on our future income tax provision. See Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nBased on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss set forth in this annual report, the following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\n\nThe increase in revenue for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to our larger clients, driven by an increase in our sales and marketing activities and our improved brand awareness. We do not expect the adoption of ASC 606 in January 2018 to have a material impact on the recognition or timing of revenue.\nCost of Revenue\n\nThe increase in cost of revenue for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $7.0 million increase in personnel costs including stock-based compensation costs, driven by increased headcount and higher fair value of employee equity awards due mainly to our increased stock price, and a $3.1 million reversal of accrued USF charges recorded in 2016 resulted from a favorable ruling from the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. The increase was also driven by a $2.5 million increase in third party hosted software costs, a $1.9 million increase in data center costs, and a $0.9 million\nincrease in USF contributions and other federal telecommunication service fees, all of which were due primarily to increased client activities. The $1.5 million increase in facility-related and overhead allocation costs also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue.\nGross Profit\n\nThe increase in gross profit for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in subscription and higher amounts charged for, and better efficiencies in, professional services. The slight decrease in gross margin for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to higher stock-based compensation costs due mainly to an increase in the fair value of employee equity awards driven by our increased stock price.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\n\nThe increase in research and development expenses for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $1.9 million increase in cash-based personnel-related cost driven by increased headcount and a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation costs mainly due to higher fair value of employee equity awards driven by our increased stock price.\nSales and Marketing\n\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $4.8 million increase in cash-based personnel costs driven by increased headcount, a $3.8 million increase in commissions paid to sales personnel driven by growth in sales and bookings of our solution, a $2.0 million increase in stock-based compensation costs mainly due to higher fair value of employee equity awards driven by our increased stock price, a $1.0 million increase in discretionary and other marketing-related expenses, and a $0.9 million increase in business travel and related expenses. These increases, as well as the remainder of the increase, were primarily due to the execution of our growth strategy to acquire new clients, to increase the number of agent seats within our existing client base, and to establish brand awareness.\nWith the adoption of ASC 606 in January 2018, we expect sales and marketing expense for 2018 to decrease between $5.0 million and $7.0 million due to the deferral of a significant portion of sales commissions as required by ASC 340.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in cash-based personnel-related costs driven by increased headcount, a $2.0 million increase in settlement and associated legal costs incurred in 2017, and a $1.9 million increase in stock-based compensation costs due mainly to higher fair value of employee equity awards driven by our increased stock price and the modification of equity awards held by a former executive. See Note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. These increases were offset in part by a $1.4 million decrease in facilities and allocated overhead costs and a $2.1 million reversal of interest and penalties on the accrued federal fees during 2017 following a favorable ruling from the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for more information.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nThe favorable change in other income (expense), net for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $1.0 million loss on the refinancing of debt recorded in the third quarter of 2016 in connection with the repayment of amounts due under the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement. See Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. The favorable change was also driven by lower interest expense resulting from lower interest rates under the 2016 Loan and Security Agreement versus the prior loan and security agreements, partially offset by the $0.4 million non-cash adjustment on investment for 2017.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\n\nThe increase in revenue for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to our larger clients, driven by an increase in our sales and marketing activities and our improved brand awareness. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the majority of our revenues and revenue growth has been from our larger clients as we move to larger average deals sizes and maintain strong customer retention rates.\nCost of Revenue\n\nThe increase in cost of revenue for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $4.0 million increase in cash-based personnel costs driven by increased headcount, a $2.2 million increase in third party hosted software costs due to increased client activities, a $1.5 million increase in USF contributions and other federal telecommunication service fees primarily due to increased client usage, a $1.3 million increase in facility-related costs, a $0.7 million increase in data center costs due to increased client activities, a $0.6 million increase in depreciation expenses, a $0.6 million increase in travel expenses, and a $0.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to our business growth. These increases were offset in part by a $1.3 million decrease in telecommunication carrier costs relating to our clients' long distance call usage due to improved usage efficiencies and by a $3.1 million reversal in the fourth quarter of 2016 of accrued USF charges due to a favorable ruling from the FCC's Competition Wireline Bureau.\nGross Profit\n\nThe increases in gross profit and gross margin for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to economies of scale for subscription, improved efficiencies in usage, and higher amounts charged for, and better efficiencies in, professional services. In addition, the reversal of $3.1 million in USF charges during the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the favorable ruling from the FCC's Competition Wireline Bureau resulted in an increase in gross profit and gross margin for 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effect of the USF reversal, the increase in gross margin for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher amounts charged for, and better efficiencies in, professional services, improved efficiencies in usage, and economies of scale for subscription.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\n\nThe increase in research and development expenses for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $0.4 million increase in consulting expenses, a $0.3 million increase in depreciation expenses, a $0.3 million increase in travel expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses.\nSales and Marketing\n\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $4.2 million increase in cash-based personnel costs driven by increased headcount, a $3.0 million increase in commissions paid to sales personnel due to increased bookings, a $1.5 million increase in discretionary and other marketing-related expenses, a $0.8 million increase in travel expenses, a $0.6 million increase in facilities and allocated overhead costs, and a $0.6 million increase in stock-based compensation. These increases as well as the remainder of the increase were primarily due to the execution of our growth strategy to acquire new clients, grow the number of agent seats within our existing client base and establish brand awareness. The increase in stock-based compensation was also due to an increase in the fair value of employee equity awards.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $0.8 million adjustment recorded in the first and the second quarters of 2015 for additional sales taxes for certain revenue earned during the period 2011 through the first quarter of 2015, a $0.7 million decrease in facilities and allocated overhead costs, a decrease of $0.5 million in legal and consulting expenses, and a decrease of $0.4 million related to the reversal of contingent sales tax liabilities. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million in cash-based personnel costs driven by increased headcount, an increase of $0.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, and an increase of $0.4 million due to the one time benefit in the second quarter of 2015 related to our entry into a consent decree with the FCC.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nThe increase in interest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $1.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in connection with the repayment of amounts due under the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement. The loss was comprised of $0.4 million in prepayment penalties, a $0.4 million write-off of unamortized debt discounts, and a $0.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. This increase was partially offset by lower interest expense related to lower interest rates under the 2016 Loan and Security Agreement compared to the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have financed our operations, primarily through sales of our solution, lease facilities and net proceeds from our equity and debt financings. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $68.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $32.6 million outstanding under our New Revolving Credit Facility as described in the following. On August 1, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement ( 2016 Loan and Security Agreement\u201d) with two lenders for a new revolving credit facility ( New Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $50.0 million. The New Revolving Credit Facility matures August 1, 2019. Under the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility, the balance outstanding cannot exceed our trailing four months of MRR (monthly recurring revenue including subscription and usage) multiplied by the average trailing 12 month dollar based retention rate (calculated on the same basis as set forth in Item 7 of this report, see Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\u201d). The New Revolving Credit Facility carries a variable annual interest rate of the prime rate plus 0.50%, subject to a 0.25% increase if our adjusted EBITDA is negative at the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, we are required to maintain $25.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents deposited with two lenders in connection with our 2016 Loan and Security Agreement. See Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. As of December 31, 2017, the amount available for additional borrowings was $17.4 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and the amount available for borrowing under our New Revolving Credit Facility (or any refinancing of the facility) will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, continuing market acceptance of our solution, client retention, our ability to gain new clients, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the outcome of any pending or future litigation or other claims by third parties or governmental entities, the expansion of sales and marketing activities and the introduction of new and enhanced offerings. We may also acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies and intellectual property rights, which may increase our future capital requirements, both to pay acquisition costs and to support our combined operations. We may raise additional equity or debt financing at any time. We may not be able to raise additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired or required, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, if our operating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we will be subject to increased debt service obligations and could also be subject to new or additional restrictive covenants and other operating restrictions that could harm our ability to conduct our business.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by or used in operating activities is primarily influenced by our personnel-related expenditures, data center and telecommunications carrier costs, office and facility related costs, USF contributions and other regulatory costs and the amount and timing of client payments. Our largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our clients for subscription and related usage services. Payments from clients for our solutions and usage services are typically received monthly. If we continue to improve our financial results, we expect net cash provided by operating activities to increase.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.1 million compared to $6.8 million for the same period of 2016. The increase of $4.3 million was primarily due to an $8.0 million favorable impact from a decrease in net loss after adjusting for non-cash expenses, offset by a $3.7 million decrease in net cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash outflows during 2017 included total payments of $1.8 million for settlement, legal and indemnification fees related to the Melcher litigation. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1.3 million compared to cash inflows of $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. This unfavorable change was primarily due to a $1.8 million unfavorable change in accounts receivable driven by increased sales, a $1.1 million unfavorable change in prepaid expenses and other current assets mainly due to higher deferred cost of revenue, and a $1.2 million unfavorable change in accrued and other current liabilities primarily related to accrued cash-based personnel-related cost driven by headcount and the timing of payments for accrued liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.8 million compared to net cash used of $12.9 million for the same period of 2015. The $19.8 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $14.6 million favorable impact from a decrease in net loss after adjusting for non-cash expenses and a $5.2 million favorable change in net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2.4 million compared to cash outflows of $2.8 million for the same period in 2015, resulted in an overall improvement of $5.2 million. This improvement was primarily due to a $2.6 million favorable change in deferred revenue mainly attributable to increased billings, $2.4 million favorable change in accounts payable related to timing of payments, and $1.8 million favorable change in accrued and other current liabilities primarily due to employee paid-time off, sales commissions and bonus, driven by our improved sales and financial performance and increased headcount. This improvement was offset in part primarily by an unfavorable change of $1.0 million in accounts receivable due to increased sales.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. The 0.3 million increase in cash used was primarily driven by the $1.5 million increase in purchase of property and equipment, offset primarily by our purchase of $1.2 million in convertible notes held for investment in 2016. Our most significant capital expenditures have been investments in our software and equipment for our data centers. We expect such capital investment will continue in the future to support our expected growth.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $22.1 million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by our 2015 activities, including the proceeds of $40.0 million received in 2015 from the maturity of our short-term investments, $0.8 million release in restricted cash in 2015 due to the release of two letters of credit related to our office lease obligation and an insurance policy, offset in part by the $20.0 million purchase of short-term investments in 2015. The purchase of $1.2 million in convertible notes held for investment in 2016 also contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in 2016.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used of $4.8 million for the same period in 2016. This $7.2 million favorable change was primarily driven by a $1.7 million increase in cash received from stock option exercises in 2017, a $2.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan in 2017, and our debt refinancing activities in 2016 including the $36.9 million repayments on notes payable and revolving line of credit as part of our cancellation of the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement, offset in part by the cash received from the $32.6 million drawdown under our New Revolving Credit Facility in 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $1.8 million favorable change was primarily driven by the $3.0 million increase in cash received from stock option exercises, a $0.6 million increase in cash received from the\nsale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, and by our 2016 debt refinancing activities including the cash received from the $32.6 million drawdown in 2016 under our New Revolving Credit Facility, offset in part by the repayments of $36.9 million in notes payable and our revolving line of credit as part of our cancellation of the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the 2014 Loan and Security Agreement during 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8, Note 1, of this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue consists of subscription services and related usage as well as professional services. We charge clients monthly subscription fees for access to our VCC solution. Monthly subscription fees are primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific VCC functionalities and applications deployed by the client. Agent seats are defined as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access the VCC cloud platform. Clients typically have more named agents than agent seats. Multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of our clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage. A small percentage of our clients subscribe to our platform but purchase telephony usage directly from a wholesale telecommunications service provider. We do not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes used for inbound and outbound customer interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments whereby the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. Professional services revenue is derived primarily from implementations, including application configuration, system integration, optimization, education and training services. Clients are not permitted to take possession of our software.\nWe offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to clients, generally with 30 days' notice required for changes in the number of agent seats and sometimes with a minimum number of agent seats requirement. Our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. As a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice. Larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including plans bundled with usage, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. Support activities include technical assistance and upgrades and enhancements to our solution on a when-and-if-available basis, which are not billed separately.\nWe generally require advance deposits from our clients based on estimated usage. Fees for certain clients' usage are applied against the advance deposit resulting in continuous consumption and requiring frequent replenishment of the deposit. Any unused portion of the deposit is refundable to the client upon termination of the arrangement, provided all amounts due have been paid. All fees, except usage deposits, are non-refundable.\nProfessional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by us directly or, alternatively, clients may also choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers.\nOur sales arrangements generally involve multiple deliverables, including subscription services and related usage as well as professional services, all of which have standalone value to the client. We allocate arrangement consideration to these deliverables based on the relative standalone selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE\u201d) if available; (ii) Third Party Evidence ( TPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available; and (iii) Best Estimate of Selling Price ( BESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nVSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element to\neither the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately. We have not met the criteria to establish selling prices based on VSOE.\nTPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Our services are significantly differentiated such that the comparable pricing of deliverables with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine the standalone selling prices of similar deliverables sold by competitors. As a result, we have not met the criteria to establish selling prices based on TPE.\nBESP. Since we are unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, pricing policies, market conditions, and competitive landscape. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables.\nWe recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria have been met:\n \u2022 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u2022 delivery has occurred; \n \u2022 the fee is fixed or determinable; and \n \u2022 collection is reasonably assured.  Revenue allocated to the separate accounting units is recognized as follows:\n \u2022 fixed subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, predominantly the monthly contractual billing period; \n \u2022 variable usage revenue is recognized as actual usage occurs. Usage revenue in subscription arrangements that include bundled usage is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable term, as the Company cannot reliably estimate client usage patterns; and \n \u2022 professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on labor hours, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  At the time of each revenue transaction, we assess whether fees under the arrangement are fixed or determinable and whether collection is probable. For arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue as these amounts become due and payable. We assess collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the client. If we determine that collection of fees is not reasonably assured, we defer the revenue and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment. We maintain a revenue reserve for potential credits to be issued in accordance with service level agreements or for other revenue adjustments.\nSignificant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period. Generally, we are able to estimate whether collection is probable, but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination. Key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment, including public information, historical and current financial statements and past collection history. If our experience were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer which may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added and excise taxes. We record USF contributions and other regulatory costs on a gross basis in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and record surcharges and sales, use and excise taxes billed to our clients on a net basis. The cost of gross USF contributions payable to USAC and\nsuppliers is presented as a cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Surcharges and sales, use and excise taxes incurred in excess of amounts billed to our clients are presented in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nContractual Obligations\nCommitments\nOur principal contractual obligations consist of future payment obligations under debt, capital leases to finance data centers and other computer and networking equipment, operating leases for office space, research and development, and sales and marketing facilities, and agreements with third parties to provide co-location hosting, telecommunication usage and equipment maintenance services.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands).\n\n(1) Represents the outstanding principal balance under a promissory note with USAC. Interest on these obligations is described in Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K.\n(2) Represents outstanding principal balance under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Interest on this obligation is described in Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K.\n(3) Represents financing of computer and networking equipment and software purchases for our co-location data centers.\n(4) Represents our obligations to make payments under the lease agreements for our office facilities and office equipment leases.\n(5) Represents guaranteed minimum payments for co-location facilities and services.\n(6) Represents guaranteed minimum payments for telecommunication services.\n(7) Represents our payment obligations under maintenance services contracts for certain data center equipment.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify clients, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. Other than as described below, there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOn October 27, 2016, we received notice from Lance Fried, a former officer and director of Face It, of his claim for indemnification by us (as successor in interest to Face It), and for advancement of all legal fees and expenses he incurs in connection with the defense of the Melcher litigation. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K for detail. As of May 31, 2017, we had advanced Mr. Fried $62 thousand in connection with this claim. However, we dispute that Mr. Fried is entitled to advancement in connection with the Melcher Litigation. On July 31, 2017, Mr. Fried filed a complaint against us in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, in which he alleges that we breached advancement obligations to him. In the lawsuit, Mr. Fried seeks advancement of his legal fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the Melcher litigation, payment of his legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with his advancement action, and interest. We believe the action is without merit and are defending against it vigorously. On December 7, 2017, the Delaware Chancery Court stayed Mr. Fried's advancement lawsuit, in favor of arbitration. On January 9, 2018, we received Mr. Fried's demand for arbitration against us with respect to the same matter. Regardless of the outcome of Mr. Fried's advancement action against us, Mr. Fried is required to reimburse us for any amounts advanced to him if it is ultimately determined that Mr. Fried is not entitled to indemnification in connection with the Melcher litigation. In addition, we believe we have indemnification rights against the former stockholders of Face It (including Mr. Fried) for all losses that are incurred by us in connection with the Melcher litigation, including without limitation, amounts incurred to indemnify or advance the legal fees and expenses of Mr. Fried pursuant to his indemnification claim against us.\nContingencies - Legal and Regulatory\nWe are subject to certain legal and regulatory proceedings, and from time to time may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings relating to contractual disputes, intellectual property rights, employment matters, regulatory compliance matters, and other litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of business. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing specific litigation and regulatory matters using reasonably available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel, which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes, assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies. Legal fees are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
