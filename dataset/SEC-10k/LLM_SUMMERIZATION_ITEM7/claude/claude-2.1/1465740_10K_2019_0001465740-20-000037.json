Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral\nWe are a Maryland corporation focused on investing in and managing Agency residential mortgage-backed securities, or Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We are externally managed by PRCM Advisers LLC, or PRCM Advisers, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine River Capital Management L.P., or Pine River.\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Agency RMBS (which includes inverse interest-only Agency securities classified as Agency Derivatives\u201d for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP), meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (or Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (or Fannie Mae), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac), or collectively, the government sponsored entities, or GSEs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-Agency securities, meaning securities that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>MSR; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We generally view our target assets in two strategies that are based on our core competencies of understanding and managing prepayment and credit risk. Our rates strategy includes assets that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds, specifically Agency RMBS and MSR. Our credit strategy includes assets that are primarily sensitive to changes in inherent credit risk, including non-Agency securities. Other assets include financial and mortgage-related assets other than the target assets in our rates and credit strategies, including certain non-hedging transactions that may produce non-qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests.\nWithin our MSR business, we purchase the right to control the servicing of residential mortgage loans and the obligation to service the loans in accordance with relevant standards from high-quality originators. We do not directly service the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with appropriately licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer.\nOn April 26, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we would acquire CYS Investments, Inc., or CYS, a Maryland corporation investing in primarily Agency RMBS and treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The transaction was approved by the stockholders of both Two Harbors and CYS on July 27, 2018, and the merger was completed on July 31, 2018, at which time CYS became our wholly owned subsidiary. In exchange for all of the shares of CYS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, we issued approximately 72.6 million new shares of common stock, as well as aggregate cash consideration of $15.0 million, to CYS common stockholders. In addition, we issued 3 million shares of newly classified Series D cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 8 million shares of newly classified Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock in exchange for all shares of CYS's Series A and Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding prior to the effective time of the merger. The financial results of CYS since the closing date of the acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe our investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the mortgage market, with a focus on asset selection and the implementation of a relative value investment approach. In making our capital allocation decisions, we take into consideration a number of factors, including the opportunities available in the marketplace, the cost and availability of financing, and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, capital allocation reflects management's flexible approach to investing in the marketplace. The following table provides our capital allocation in each of our investment strategies as of December 31, 2019 and the four immediately preceding quarter-ends:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Capital Allocations(1) as of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rates strategy\n</td> <td>78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit strategy\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Capital allocation percentages reflect management's assessment regarding the extent to which each asset class contributes to total portfolio risk. Does not represent funding allocation or balance sheet financing of such assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs our capital allocation shifts, our annualized yields and cost of financing will also shift. At December 31, 2019, our capital allocation was 78% to our rates strategy and 22% to our credit strategy. Going forward, we intend to allocate capital to the most attractive investment opportunities in our target asset classes. We do not have a fixed allocation target between our rates and credit strategies. Our investment decisions are not driven solely by annualized yields, but rather a multitude of macroeconomic drivers, including market environments and their respective impacts (e.g., uncertainty of prepayment speeds, extension risk and credit events).\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2019, our net yield realized on the portfolio was slightly higher than the prior quarter, but lower than recent periods due to purchases of lower coupon/sales of higher coupon Agency RMBS and higher prepays on Agency RMBS, offset by a decrease in our cost of financing due to decreases in LIBOR. The following table provides the average annualized yield on our assets, including Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities and MSR for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average annualized portfolio yield (1)\n</td> <td>3.54%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.67%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.93%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.14%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of financing (2)\n</td> <td>2.35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.51%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.47%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.53%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net portfolio yield\n</td> <td>1.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.61%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Average annualized yield includes interest income on Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities and servicing income, net of amortization and servicing expenses on MSR and incorporates future prepayment, credit loss and other assumptions, all of which are estimates and subject to change.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Cost of financing includes swap and cap interest rate spread.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB. We also finance our MSR through repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes.\nOur Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while non-Agency securities and MSR, with less liquidity and/or more exposure to credit risk and prepayment, utilize lower levels of leverage. As a result, our debt-to-equity ratio is determined by our portfolio mix as well as many additional factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the availability and price of our financing, the diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. Over the past several quarters, we have generally maintained a debt-to-equity ratio range of 5.0 to 6.0 times to finance our securities portfolio and MSR, on a fully deployed capital basis. Our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the composition of our portfolio; specifically, the higher percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio is, while the higher percentage of non-Agency securities and MSR we hold, the lower our debt-to-equity ratio is. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from offerings we conduct. As we allocate capital toward Agency RMBS and deploy financing on MSR, our debt-to-equity ratio may increase beyond 6.0 times in the future. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Repurchase Agreements\u201d for further discussion.\nWe recognize that investing in our target assets is competitive and we compete with other entities for attractive investment opportunities. We rely on our management team and our dedicated team of investment professionals provided by our external manager to identify investment opportunities. We believe that our significant focus in the residential market, the extensive mortgage market expertise of our investment team, our strong analytics and our disciplined relative value investment approach give us a competitive advantage versus our peers.\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. While we do not currently originate or service residential mortgage loans, certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to own and manage MSR.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\nOur net interest income includes income from our securities portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of subservicing expenses, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results will also be affected by default rates and credit losses with respect to the mortgage loans underlying our non-Agency securities.\nFair Value Measurement\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and, therefore, our consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss) are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At December 31, 2019, approximately 93.3% of our total assets, or $33.5 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See Note 10 - Fair Value to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices.\nAny temporary change in the fair value of our available-for-sale, or AFS, securities, excluding certain Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and does not impact our earnings. Our reported earnings (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss), is affected, however, by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, including interest rate swap, cap and swaption agreements and certain other derivative instruments (i.e., TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, U.S. Treasury futures, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities), which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and MSR.\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire investment portfolio reported at fair value is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing vendors. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other securities, including interest-only Agency RMBS, inverse interest-only Agency RMBS, and non-Agency securities. We also receive three vendor quotes for the MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing vendors and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset periods, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For non-Agency securities, the third-party pricing vendors utilize both observable and unobservable inputs such as pool-specific characteristics (e.g., loan age, loan size, credit quality of borrowers, vintage, servicer quality), floating rate indices, prepayment and default assumptions, and recent trading of the same or similar securities. For MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, geographical location, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields and trading levels. Pricing vendors will customarily incorporate loan servicing cost, servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment.\nWe evaluate the prices we receive from both third-party brokers and pricing vendors by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge valuations from third-party brokers and pricing vendors to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of MSR based upon the average of prices received from third-party vendors, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures.\nWe utilize bid side\u201d pricing for our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the bid-offer\u201d spread. To the extent that this occurs, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets. The Company classified 6.0% of its total assets as Level 3 fair value assets at December 31, 2019.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities and MSR may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use inputs that are current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market dislocation, may have reduced transparency.\nClassification and Valuation of Available-for-Sale Securities\nOur securities investments consist primarily of Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities that we classify as available-for-sale, or AFS. All assets classified as AFS, excluding certain Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities, are reported at estimated fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity, on an after-tax basis. On July 1, 2015, we elected the fair value option for Agency interest-only securities acquired on or after such date. All Agency interest-only securities acquired on or after July 1, 2015 are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nWhen the estimated fair value of an AFS security is less than amortized cost, we consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of the security that is required to be recognized in GAAP net income (loss). The determination of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors. Consideration is given to whether we (i) have the intent to sell the investment securities, (ii) are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery, or (iii) do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities. Investments with unrealized losses are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired if we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time, to maturity if necessary, sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the amortized cost basis of the investments. If an impairment is determined to be solely driven by the inability to fully recover the entire amortized cost basis over the remaining life of the security, the security is further analyzed for credit loss (the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis). The credit loss, if any, is then recognized in GAAP net income (loss), while the balance of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nClassification and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe account for our MSR at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income (loss), rather than at amortized cost. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors. Although MSR transactions are observable in the marketplace, the details of those transactions are not necessarily reflective of the value of our MSR portfolio. Third-party vendors use both observable market data and unobservable market data (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, discount rates and cost to service) as inputs into models, which help to inform their best estimates of fair value market price.\nInterest Income Recognition\nOur interest income on our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method, as adjusted for actual prepayments. We estimate prepayments for our Agency interest-only securities, which represent our right to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest flows of specific Agency and collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMO, securities. As a result, if prepayments increase (or are expected to increase), we will accelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums. Conversely, if prepayments decrease (or are expected to decrease), we will decelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums.\nOur interest income on our non-Agency securities rated below AA, including unrated securities, is recognized in accordance with estimated cash flows. Cash flows from a security are estimated by applying assumptions used to determine the fair value of such security and the excess of the future cash flows over the investment are recognized as interest income under the effective yield method. We review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections at least quarterly and monitor these projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in interest income recognized on, or the carrying value of, such securities.\nFor non-Agency securities purchased at a discount, we account for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from our initial investment in debt securities acquired if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. We limit the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of an estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest, and other cash flows (cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected) over the initial investment. The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected (nonaccretable difference or designated credit reserve) is not recognized as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield over the remaining life of the security. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairments.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. The fair value adjustments of our current derivative instruments affect net income as the hedge for accounting purposes is being treated as an economic, or trading, hedge and not as a qualifying hedging instrument.\nDerivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. We utilize third-party pricing vendors and broker quotes to value our financial derivative instruments. If our hedging activities do not achieve their desired results, our reported GAAP net income (loss) may be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nOur financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes, except for those taxable benefits or provisions recognized by our TRSs. We estimate, based on existence of sufficient evidence, the ability to realize the remainder of any deferred tax asset our TRSs recognize. Any adjustments to such estimates will be made in the period such determination is made. We plan to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT. As a result of our expected REIT qualification, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level taxes. However, many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( TCJA\u201d) significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The TCJA requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the TCJA and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. Technical corrections or other amendments of the TCJA or administrative guidance interpreting the TCJA may be forthcoming at any time. While we do not anticipate a material effect on our operations, we continue to analyze and monitor the application of the TCJA to our business, our peers and the economic environment.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\n2019 delivered a significant drop in interest rates across the curve. In addition, the Federal Reserve, or Fed, cut interest rates three times during the year, moving from a stance of patience and neutrality to one more concerned with sustaining economic expansion. Worries about a global slowdown in GDP growth and the effect of trade wars were present throughout the year, and realized and implied volatilities increased sharply. Primary mortgage rates also moved lower, which had multiple effects on Agency RMBS including increased prepayment expectations and current coupon spread widening. At the same time, higher coupon RMBS performed well, as did prepay-protected securities.\nThe repo markets made headlines during the last half of the year. In response to the spike in overnight rates in September, the Fed established a series of term and overnight repo operations, and also began a series of Treasury bill purchases to rebuild its balance sheet and add reserves to the system. While rates remained elevated during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Fed's actions clearly stabilized the market. This was on display on the final day of the year, when overnight repo rates cleared below the Fed's target, which is highly unusual. Given the Fed's strong response, our expectation is that the funding markets will normalize over time.\nIn mortgage credit, home price appreciation has remained solid with around 3-4% growth year-over-year, and expectations are for continued slow but increasing home prices. We believe that increasing housing affordability can be a significant driver of total return performance for our legacy assets. While 10-year Treasury rates have fluctuated in a 200 basis point range since 2014, the effects of mortgage rates and income growth have conspired to keep overall affordability in a narrow range.\nWe believe our blended Agency and non-Agency securities portfolio and our investing expertise, as well as our operational capabilities to invest in MSR, will allow us to better navigate the dynamic mortgage market while future regulatory and policy activities take shape. Having a diversified portfolio allows us to mitigate a variety of risks, including interest rate and RMBS spread volatility.\nThe following table provides the carrying value of our investment portfolio by product type:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,763,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,665,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hybrid ARM\n</td> <td>14,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Agency\n</td> <td>27,778,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,685,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency Derivatives\n</td> <td>68,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior\n</td> <td>3,073,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,854,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mezzanine\n</td> <td>480,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>928,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-only securities\n</td> <td>74,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Non-Agency\n</td> <td>3,628,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,867,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights\n</td> <td>1,909,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,993,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,384,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,616,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates\nOur Agency RMBS portfolio is subject to inherent prepayment risk. We seek to offset a portion of our Agency pool exposure to prepayment speeds through our MSR and interest-only Agency RMBS portfolios. Generally, a decline in interest rates that leads to rising prepayment speeds will cause the market value of our RMBS purchased at a discount (including interest-only securities) and MSR to deteriorate, and our RMBS purchased at a premium to increase. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates increase and prepayments slow. The low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term. However, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, could cause prepayment speeds to increase on many RMBS, which could lead to less attractive reinvestment opportunities. Nonetheless, we believe our portfolio management approach, including our asset selection process, positions us to respond to a variety of market scenarios, including an overall faster prepayment environment.\nThe following table provides the three-month weighted average constant prepayment rate, or CPR, on our investment portfolio by type for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average CPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Agency securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we are unable to predict the movement in interest rates in 2020 and beyond, our diversified portfolio management strategy is intended to generate attractive yields with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles.\nOur Agency RMBS are collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage loans, or hybrid ARMs, which are mortgage loans that have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period and adjustable thereafter. Our Agency portfolio also includes securities with implicit or explicit prepayment protection, including lower loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $200,000 in initial principal balance), higher LTVs (securities collateralized by loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80%), certain geographic concentrations and lower FICO scores. Our overall allocation of Agency RMBS and holdings of pools with specific characteristics are viewed in the context of our aggregate rates strategy, including MSR and related derivative hedging instruments. Additionally, the selection of securities with certain attributes is driven by the perceived relative value of the securities, which factors in the opportunities in the marketplace, the cost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, Agency RMBS capital allocation reflects management's flexible approach to investing in the marketplace.\nThe following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by

We evaluate credit risk on our non-Agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process, which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk, including extensive initial modeling and scenario analysis. In addition, the discounted purchase prices paid for our non-Agency securities provide additional insulation from credit losses in the event we receive less than 100% of par on such assets. At purchase, we estimate the portion of the discount we do not expect to recover and factor that into our expected yield and accretion methodology. We may also record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a portion of our investment in a security to the extent we believe that the amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows. We review our non-Agency securities on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk-adjusted returns on such investments and through on-going asset surveillance. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, adversely impacting our operating results.\nCounterparty exposure and leverage ratio\nWe monitor counterparty exposure in our broker, banking and lending counterparties on a daily basis. We believe our broker and banking counterparties are well-capitalized organizations and we attempt to manage our cash balances across these organizations to reduce our exposure to any single counterparty.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had entered into repurchase agreements with 47 counterparties, 24 of which had outstanding balances at December 31, 2019. In addition, we held long-term secured advances from the FHLB, short- and long-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities, long-term term notes payable and long-term unsecured convertible senior notes. As of December 31, 2019, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 6.1:1.0.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $558.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $1.3 million of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and $1.6 billion of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $354.6 million of unpledged MSR. Overall, we had unused borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities of $1.2 billion. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided or the inability to meet lenders' eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. If borrowing rates and collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than if we carried higher leverage.\nWe also monitor exposure to our MSR counterparties. We may be required to make representations and warranties to investors in the loans underlying the MSR we own; however, some of our MSR were purchased on a bifurcated basis, meaning the representation and warranty obligations remain with the seller. If the representations and warranties we make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of our portfolio. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.\nProposed changes to LIBOR\nLIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark\u201d or reference rate\u201d for various commercial and financial contracts, including corporate and municipal bonds and loans, floating rate mortgages, asset-backed securities, consumer loans, and interest rate swaps and other derivatives. It is expected that a number of private-sector banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021 when their current reporting commitment ends, which could either cause LIBOR to stop publication immediately or cause LIBOR's regulator to determine that its quality has degraded to the degree that it is no longer representative of its underlying market. The U.S. and other countries are currently working to replace LIBOR with alternative reference rates. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Some market participants may continue to explore whether other U.S. dollar-based reference rates would be more appropriate for certain types of instruments. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR, and various organizations are currently working on industry wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. We have material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR and are monitoring this activity, evaluating the related risks and our exposure.\nSummary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders was $115.8 million and $248.2 million ($0.41 and $0.93 per diluted weighted average share) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders of $573.5 million and $109.7 million ($(2.31) and $(0.53) per diluted weighted average share) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were $59.0 million and net unrealized gains on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive income, net of tax, were $578.6 million, respectively. This, combined with GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders of $115.8 million and $248.2 million, resulted in comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders of $56.8 million and $826.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net unrealized gains on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive income, net of tax, were $265.5 million and net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive loss, net of tax were $233.9 million, respectively. This, combined with GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders of $573.5 million and $109.7 million, resulted in comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of $307.9 million and $343.6 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nOur book value per common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was $14.54 at December 31, 2019, an increase from $13.11 book value per common share at December 31, 2018. During this twelve month period, we issued 24,439,436 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $336.3 million and recognized comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders of $826.7 million, which drove the overall increase in book value in excess of the total distributions paid to common and preferred stockholders during the year.\nThe following tables present the components of

The analysis of our financial results during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is omitted from this Form 10-K and included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased from $252.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 to $238.4 million for the same period in 2019 due to purchases of lower coupon Agency RMBS, sales of higher coupon Agency RMBS and higher prepayments on Agency RMBS with unamortized premium. Interest income increased from $870.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $994.7 million for the same period in 2019 due to the growth of our Agency RMBS portfolio.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased from $162.3 million and $519.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, to $167.3 million and $714.3 million for the same periods in 2019 due to increased financing on AFS securities and on MSR due to portfolio growth, and the MSR securitization completed in 2019.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following tables present the components of interest income and average annualized net asset yield earned by asset type, the components of interest expense and average annualized cost of funds on borrowings incurred by liability and/or collateral type, and net interest income and average annualized net interest rate spread for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td>

Interest rates steadily increased throughout the year ended December 31, 2018 and remained generally flat throughout the first quarter of 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, interest rates began decreasing in anticipation of a rate cut by the Fed, which made its first rate cut of the year in August. The Fed subsequently made two more rate cuts in 2019 until rates stabilized toward the end of the year.\nThe decrease in yields on Agency AFS securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was predominantly driven by purchases of pools with lower yields and sales of pools with higher yields. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency AFS securities for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was the result of a decrease in average LIBOR through the respective periods. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily the result of the elevated repo/LIBOR spreads that persisted throughout the latter half of 2019.\nThe decrease in yields on non-Agency securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was driven by purchases of non-Agency securities at lower yields than our existing portfolio and the sale of higher yield bonds that we believed had realized their upside potential. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of non-Agency AFS securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was the result of lower borrowing spreads on the lower yielding securities.\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency Derivatives for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was the result of a decrease in average LIBOR through the respective periods. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency Derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily the result of the elevated repo/LIBOR spreads that persisted throughout the latter half of 2019.\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of MSR for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was the result of the issuance of term notes payable in June 2019, which incur lower amortization of deferred debt issuance costs due to their longer term to maturity and the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the termination of a financing facility and generally better financing terms offered by counterparties.\nOur convertible senior notes are unsecured and pay interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum. The cost of funds associated with our convertible senior notes for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was consistent.\nThe following tables present the components of the yield earned by investment type on our AFS securities portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross yield/stated coupon\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (premium amortization) discount accretion\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net yield (2)\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross yield/stated coupon\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (premium amortization) discount accretion\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net yield (2)\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes Agency Derivatives.

Since swaps, caps and swaptions are used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities.\n(Loss) Gain on Other Derivative Instruments\nThe following table provides a summary of the total (loss) gain recognized on other derivative instruments we hold for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, Markit IOS total return swaps, short U.S. treasuries, U.S. Treasury futures and inverse interest-only securities during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net of accretion, on inverse interest-only securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on short U.S. treasuries\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments (1)\n</td> <td>(12,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,018\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on other derivative instruments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,800\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,857\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor further details regarding our use of derivative instruments and related activity, refer to Note 7 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Income\nWe recorded other income of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and $0.3 million and $3.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.

The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. In connection with the acquisition of CYS effective July 31, 2018, the management agreement was amended to (i) reduce PRCM Advisers' base management fee with respect to the additional equity under management resulting from the merger to 0.75% from the effective time through the first anniversary of the effective time and (ii) for the fiscal quarter in which closing of the merger occurred, to make a one-time downward adjustment of Pine River's management fees payable by Two Harbors for such quarter by $15.0 million to offset the cash consideration payable to stockholders of CYS, plus an additional downward adjustment of up to $3.3 million for certain transaction-related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the total one-time downward adjustment to management fees was $17.5 million. Effective July 31, 2019, the management fee reduction on the equity acquired in the CYS transaction expired. We do not anticipate any further downward adjustments to management fees for transaction-related expenses.\nWe also incur servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of MSR and other operating expenses. The increase in servicing expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was largely the result of an increase in the size of our MSR portfolio. Included in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us, including compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our activities in accordance with the management agreement; we do not reimburse PRCM Advisers for any expenses related to the compensation of our chief executive officer or chief investment officer.\nWe have direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services, technology and certain office lease payments, but most of our expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nAcquisition Transaction Costs\nThe acquisition of CYS was treated as an asset purchase under U.S. GAAP. Given there were no meaningful nonfinancial assets and non-current assets acquired in the merger with CYS and no identified intangible assets to assign value, the excess consideration and costs associated with the transaction were recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as acquisition transaction costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these acquisition transaction costs totaled approximately $86.7 million.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn connection with the acquisition of CYS, we incurred restructuring charges, including termination benefits, contract terminations and other associated costs, of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of $2.4 million and $13.6 million, respectively, which was primarily due to losses recognized on MSR, offset by net gains recognized on derivative instruments held in the Company's TRSs. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our TRSs recognized a provision for income taxes of $6.7 million and $41.8 million, which was primarily due to realized gains on sales of AFS securities and gains recognized on MSR held in the TRSs as well as the write-down of net deferred tax assets resulting from the deemed liquidation of one of our TRSs due to its TRS election revocation, offset by net losses incurred on derivative instruments held in the TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nFinancial Condition\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value\nAgency RMBS\nOur Agency RMBS AFS portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS AFS were Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations that carry an implied rating of AAA,\u201d or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. government. The majority of these securities consist of whole pools in which we own all of the investment interests in the securities.\nThe tables below summarize certain characteristics of our Agency RMBS AFS at

We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve, as there remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays.\nDue to acquisitions of legacy\u201d non-Agency securities, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount increased from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 (as disclosed in Note 4 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). From December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount increased from 65.6% to 75.3%.\nA subprime bond may generally be considered higher risk; however, if purchased at a discount that reflects a high expectation of credit losses, it could be viewed as less risky than a prime bond, which is subject to unanticipated credit loss performance. Accordingly, we believe our risk profile in owning a heavily discounted subprime bond with known delinquencies affords us the ability to assume a higher percentage of expected credit loss with comparable risk-adjusted returns to a less discounted prime bond with a lower percentage of expected credit loss.\nThe following tables present certain information by investment type and, if

These borrowings are collateralized by our pledge of AFS securities, derivative instruments, MSR and certain cash balances. Substantially all of our Agency RMBS are currently pledged as collateral, and the majority of our non-Agency securities have been pledged as collateral, either through repurchase agreements or FHLB advances.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we formed a new trust entity, or the Issuer Trust, for the purpose of financing MSR through securitization. On June 27, 2019, we, through the Issuer Trust, completed an MSR securitization transaction pursuant to which, through two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, MSR is pledged to the Issuer Trust and in return, the Issuer Trust issued (a) an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in term notes to qualified institutional buyers and (b) a variable funding note, or VFN, with a maximum principal balance of $1.0 billion to one of the subsidiaries, in each case secured on a pari passu basis. The term notes bear interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 2.80% per annum. The term notes will mature on June 25, 2024 or, if extended pursuant to the terms of the related indenture supplement, June 25, 2026 (unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms).\nAdditionally, on January 19, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% convertible senior notes due 2022. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $282.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The majority of these proceeds were used to help fund our MSR assets, which previously had largely been funded with cash.\nAt December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes had the following characteristics:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

recorded in 2019 include dividends paid from the Company's TRSs to the REIT. Additionally, permanent tax differences recorded in both 2019 and 2018 include a recurring difference related to the intercompany sales of RMBS and a recurring difference in compensation expense related to restricted stock dividends. Temporary differences are principally timing differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting related to unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments, realized and unrealized gains and losses from MSR and accretion and amortization from Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018, there were both permanent and temporary tax differences resulting from the treatment of transaction costs and related expenses from the merger with CYS.\nChange in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities, do not impact our GAAP net (loss) income or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted for as trading instruments.\nDividends\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared cash dividends totaling $1.67 per share. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders, subject to certain distribution requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our board of directors elected to distribute the majority of our taxable income to avoid U.S. Federal Income taxes. As such, temporary differences between GAAP net income (loss) and taxable income can generate deterioration in book value on a permanent and temporary basis as taxable income is distributed that has not been earned for U.S. GAAP purposes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecasted on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could negatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls. We also believe that it gives us the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities and term notes payable to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\nOn March 21, 2019, we completed a public offering of 18,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.76 per share. On March 22, 2019, an additional 2,700,000 shares were sold to the underwriters of the offering pursuant to an overallotment option. The net proceeds were approximately $284.5 million, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $0.3 million.\nTo the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, MSR and other target assets and for other general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $558.1 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; $33.5 billion of AFS securities, MSR, and derivative assets held at fair value; and $30.3 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, increased from 5.3:10 to 6.1:1.0 and increased from 5.8:1.0 to 6.1:1.0, respectively. The increase was driven by increased financing on Agency RMBS purchases. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our economic debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes and implied debt on net TBA notional, increased from 7.2:10 to 7.5:1.0 for both periods.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $1.3 million of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and $1.6 billion of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $354.6 million of unpledged MSR. Overall, we had unused borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities of $1.2 billion, which includes the repurchase facility pursuant to which the Company may finance the VFN issued in connection with the MSR securitization transaction completed on June 27, 2019. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided or the inability to meet lenders' eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity. If borrowing rates and/or collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more leveraged organization.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not experience any restrictions to our funding sources, although balance sheet capacity of counterparties have tightened due to compliance with the Basel III regulatory capital reform rules as well as management of perceived risk in the current interest rate environment. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable, convertible notes and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had master repurchase agreements in place with 47 counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate additional counterparties to manage and optimize counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional assets or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and counterparty geographical concentration at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Counterparty Exposure(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Funding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Counterparty Exposure(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Funding\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,165,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,026,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,061,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,120,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe (2)\n</td> <td>7,519,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,728,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>646,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia (2)\n</td> <td>5,463,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,343,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,147,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,782,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,133,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,022,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the net carrying value of the assets sold under agreements to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or assets on deposit to secure the repurchase obligation, less the amount of the repurchase liability, including accrued interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Exposure to European and Asian domiciled banks and their U.S. subsidiaries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to our master repurchase agreements to fund our Agency and non-Agency securities, we have two repurchase facilities and one revolving credit facility that provide short- and long-term financing for our MSR portfolio.

As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. As of December 31, 2019, TH Insurance had $210.0 million in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of 2.00%.\nThe ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. Each advance requires approval by the FHLB and is secured by collateral in accordance with the FHLB's credit and collateral guidelines, as may be revised from time to time by the FHLB. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, Agency RMBS and certain non-Agency securities with a rating of A and above.\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the final rule excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a membership grace period that runs through February 19, 2021, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited; however, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to 40% of its total assets.\nWe are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements.

Our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities are generally actively traded and thus, in most circumstances, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including MSR, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as MSR may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain regulatory approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with regulatory requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our MSR, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises.\nIn addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities and term notes payable, a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources.\nThe following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Within 30 days\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,465,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,488,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 to 59 days\n</td> <td>6,300,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,077,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>60 to 89 days\n</td> <td>6,687,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,655,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>90 to 119 days\n</td> <td>4,740,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,938,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>120 to 364 days\n</td> <td>6,113,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,508,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One to three years\n</td> <td>584,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three to five years\n</td> <td>394,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five to ten years\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ten years and over\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,336,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,592,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our restricted and unrestricted cash balance increased approximately $519.1 million to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019.

We reimburse PRCM Advisers for (i) our allocable share of the compensation paid by PRCM Advisers to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and personnel employed by PRCM Advisers as in-house legal, tax, accounting, consulting, auditing, administrative, information technology, valuation, computer programming and development and back-office resources to us, and (ii) any amounts for personnel of PRCM Advisers' affiliates arising under a shared facilities and services agreement. We also have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for data services and technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nWe are also party to contracts that contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with brokers, underwriters, counterparties to lending agreements and investors in the RMBS we issued in connection with our previous residential mortgage loan securitization transactions, the term notes we issued in connection with our MSR securitization and the loans\nunderlying our MSR. The maximum potential future payment amount we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nInflation\nSubstantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.\nOther Matters\nWe intend to conduct our business so as to maintain our exempt status under, and not to become regulated as, an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we failed to maintain our exempt status under the 1940 Act and became regulated as an investment company, our ability to, among other things, use leverage would be substantially reduced and, as a result, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in Item 1, Business - Other Business - Regulation\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, we monitor our compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Tests of the 1940 Act in order to maintain our exempt status. As of December 31, 2019, we determined that we maintained compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Test requirements.\nWe calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code for the year ended December 31, 2019. We also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the 75% source of income test and for the 95% source of income test rules for the year ended December 31, 2019. Consequently, we met the REIT income and asset tests. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income. Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nThe TCJA made many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to businesses, including REITs and TRSs. Pursuant to the TCJA, as of January 1, 2018, the federal income tax rate applicable to corporations was reduced to 21% and the corporate alternative minimum tax was repealed. In addition, the deduction of net interest expense is limited for all businesses; provided that certain businesses, including real estate businesses, may elect not to be subject to such limitations and instead to depreciate their real property related assets over longer depreciable lives. This limitation could adversely affect our TRSs.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral\nWe are a Maryland corporation focused on investing in and managing Agency residential mortgage-backed securities, or Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We are externally managed by PRCM Advisers LLC, or PRCM Advisers, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine River Capital Management L.P., or Pine River.\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following:\n \u2022 Agency RMBS (which includes inverse interest-only Agency securities classified as Agency Derivatives\u201d for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP), meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (or Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (or Fannie Mae), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac), or collectively, the government sponsored entities, or GSEs; \n \u2022 Non-Agency securities, meaning securities that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; \n \u2022 MSR; and \n \u2022 Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio.  We generally view our target assets in two strategies that are based on our core competencies of understanding and managing prepayment and credit risk. Our rates strategy includes assets that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds, specifically Agency RMBS and MSR. Our credit strategy includes assets that are primarily sensitive to changes in inherent credit risk, including non-Agency securities. Other assets include financial and mortgage-related assets other than the target assets in our rates and credit strategies, including certain non-hedging transactions that may produce non-qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests.\nWithin our MSR business, we purchase the right to control the servicing of residential mortgage loans and the obligation to service the loans in accordance with relevant standards from high-quality originators. We do not directly service the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with appropriately licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer.\nOn April 26, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we would acquire CYS Investments, Inc., or CYS, a Maryland corporation investing in primarily Agency RMBS and treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The transaction was approved by the stockholders of both Two Harbors and CYS on July 27, 2018, and the merger was completed on July 31, 2018, at which time CYS became our wholly owned subsidiary. In exchange for all of the shares of CYS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, we issued approximately 72.6 million new shares of common stock, as well as aggregate cash consideration of $15.0 million, to CYS common stockholders. In addition, we issued 3 million shares of newly classified Series D cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 8 million shares of newly classified Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock in exchange for all shares of CYS's Series A and Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding prior to the effective time of the merger. The financial results of CYS since the closing date of the acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe our investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the mortgage market, with a focus on asset selection and the implementation of a relative value investment approach. In making our capital allocation decisions, we take into consideration a number of factors, including the opportunities available in the marketplace, the cost and availability of financing, and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, capital allocation reflects management's flexible approach to investing in the marketplace. The following table provides our capital allocation in each of our investment strategies as of December 31, 2019 and the four immediately preceding quarter-ends:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Capital Allocations(1) as of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rates strategy\n</td> <td>78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit strategy\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) Capital allocation percentages reflect management's assessment regarding the extent to which each asset class contributes to total portfolio risk. Does not represent funding allocation or balance sheet financing of such assets. \nAs our capital allocation shifts, our annualized yields and cost of financing will also shift. At December 31, 2019, our capital allocation was 78% to our rates strategy and 22% to our credit strategy. Going forward, we intend to allocate capital to the most attractive investment opportunities in our target asset classes. We do not have a fixed allocation target between our rates and credit strategies. Our investment decisions are not driven solely by annualized yields, but rather a multitude of macroeconomic drivers, including market environments and their respective impacts (e.g., uncertainty of prepayment speeds, extension risk and credit events).\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2019, our net yield realized on the portfolio was slightly higher than the prior quarter, but lower than recent periods due to purchases of lower coupon/sales of higher coupon Agency RMBS and higher prepays on Agency RMBS, offset by a decrease in our cost of financing due to decreases in LIBOR. The following table provides the average annualized yield on our assets, including Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities and MSR for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average annualized portfolio yield (1)\n</td> <td>3.54%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.67%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.93%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.14%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of financing (2)\n</td> <td>2.35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.51%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.47%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.53%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net portfolio yield\n</td> <td>1.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.61%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) Average annualized yield includes interest income on Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities and servicing income, net of amortization and servicing expenses on MSR and incorporates future prepayment, credit loss and other assumptions, all of which are estimates and subject to change. \n (2) Cost of financing includes swap and cap interest rate spread. \nWe seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB. We also finance our MSR through repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes.\nOur Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while non-Agency securities and MSR, with less liquidity and/or more exposure to credit risk and prepayment, utilize lower levels of leverage. As a result, our debt-to-equity ratio is determined by our portfolio mix as well as many additional factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the availability and price of our financing, the diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. Over the past several quarters, we have generally maintained a debt-to-equity ratio range of 5.0 to 6.0 times to finance our securities portfolio and MSR, on a fully deployed capital basis. Our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the composition of our portfolio; specifically, the higher percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio is, while the higher percentage of non-Agency securities and MSR we hold, the lower our debt-to-equity ratio is. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from offerings we conduct. As we allocate capital toward Agency RMBS and deploy financing on MSR, our debt-to-equity ratio may increase beyond 6.0 times in the future. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Repurchase Agreements\u201d for further discussion.\nWe recognize that investing in our target assets is competitive and we compete with other entities for attractive investment opportunities. We rely on our management team and our dedicated team of investment professionals provided by our external manager to identify investment opportunities. We believe that our significant focus in the residential market, the extensive mortgage market expertise of our investment team, our strong analytics and our disciplined relative value investment approach give us a competitive advantage versus our peers.\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. While we do not currently originate or service residential mortgage loans, certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to own and manage MSR.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\nOur net interest income includes income from our securities portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of subservicing expenses, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results will also be affected by default rates and credit losses with respect to the mortgage loans underlying our non-Agency securities.\nFair Value Measurement\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and, therefore, our consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss) are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At December 31, 2019, approximately 93.3% of our total assets, or $33.5 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See Note 10 - Fair Value to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices.\nAny temporary change in the fair value of our available-for-sale, or AFS, securities, excluding certain Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and does not impact our earnings. Our reported earnings (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss), is affected, however, by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, including interest rate swap, cap and swaption agreements and certain other derivative instruments (i.e., TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, U.S. Treasury futures, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities), which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and MSR.\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire investment portfolio reported at fair value is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing vendors. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other securities, including interest-only Agency RMBS, inverse interest-only Agency RMBS, and non-Agency securities. We also receive three vendor quotes for the MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing vendors and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset periods, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For non-Agency securities, the third-party pricing vendors utilize both observable and unobservable inputs such as pool-specific characteristics (e.g., loan age, loan size, credit quality of borrowers, vintage, servicer quality), floating rate indices, prepayment and default assumptions, and recent trading of the same or similar securities. For MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, geographical location, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields and trading levels. Pricing vendors will customarily incorporate loan servicing cost, servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment.\nWe evaluate the prices we receive from both third-party brokers and pricing vendors by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge valuations from third-party brokers and pricing vendors to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of MSR based upon the average of prices received from third-party vendors, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures.\nWe utilize bid side\u201d pricing for our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the bid-offer\u201d spread. To the extent that this occurs, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets. The Company classified 6.0% of its total assets as Level 3 fair value assets at December 31, 2019.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities and MSR may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use inputs that are current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market dislocation, may have reduced transparency.\nClassification and Valuation of Available-for-Sale Securities\nOur securities investments consist primarily of Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities that we classify as available-for-sale, or AFS. All assets classified as AFS, excluding certain Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities, are reported at estimated fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity, on an after-tax basis. On July 1, 2015, we elected the fair value option for Agency interest-only securities acquired on or after such date. All Agency interest-only securities acquired on or after July 1, 2015 are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nWhen the estimated fair value of an AFS security is less than amortized cost, we consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of the security that is required to be recognized in GAAP net income (loss). The determination of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors. Consideration is given to whether we (i) have the intent to sell the investment securities, (ii) are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery, or (iii) do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities. Investments with unrealized losses are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired if we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time, to maturity if necessary, sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the amortized cost basis of the investments. If an impairment is determined to be solely driven by the inability to fully recover the entire amortized cost basis over the remaining life of the security, the security is further analyzed for credit loss (the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis). The credit loss, if any, is then recognized in GAAP net income (loss), while the balance of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nClassification and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe account for our MSR at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income (loss), rather than at amortized cost. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors. Although MSR transactions are observable in the marketplace, the details of those transactions are not necessarily reflective of the value of our MSR portfolio. Third-party vendors use both observable market data and unobservable market data (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, discount rates and cost to service) as inputs into models, which help to inform their best estimates of fair value market price.\nInterest Income Recognition\nOur interest income on our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method, as adjusted for actual prepayments. We estimate prepayments for our Agency interest-only securities, which represent our right to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest flows of specific Agency and collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMO, securities. As a result, if prepayments increase (or are expected to increase), we will accelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums. Conversely, if prepayments decrease (or are expected to decrease), we will decelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums.\nOur interest income on our non-Agency securities rated below AA, including unrated securities, is recognized in accordance with estimated cash flows. Cash flows from a security are estimated by applying assumptions used to determine the fair value of such security and the excess of the future cash flows over the investment are recognized as interest income under the effective yield method. We review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections at least quarterly and monitor these projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in interest income recognized on, or the carrying value of, such securities.\nFor non-Agency securities purchased at a discount, we account for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from our initial investment in debt securities acquired if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. We limit the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of an estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest, and other cash flows (cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected) over the initial investment. The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected (nonaccretable difference or designated credit reserve) is not recognized as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield over the remaining life of the security. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairments.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. The fair value adjustments of our current derivative instruments affect net income as the hedge for accounting purposes is being treated as an economic, or trading, hedge and not as a qualifying hedging instrument.\nDerivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. We utilize third-party pricing vendors and broker quotes to value our financial derivative instruments. If our hedging activities do not achieve their desired results, our reported GAAP net income (loss) may be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nOur financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes, except for those taxable benefits or provisions recognized by our TRSs. We estimate, based on existence of sufficient evidence, the ability to realize the remainder of any deferred tax asset our TRSs recognize. Any adjustments to such estimates will be made in the period such determination is made. We plan to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT. As a result of our expected REIT qualification, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level taxes. However, many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( TCJA\u201d) significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The TCJA requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the TCJA and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. Technical corrections or other amendments of the TCJA or administrative guidance interpreting the TCJA may be forthcoming at any time. While we do not anticipate a material effect on our operations, we continue to analyze and monitor the application of the TCJA to our business, our peers and the economic environment.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\n2019 delivered a significant drop in interest rates across the curve. In addition, the Federal Reserve, or Fed, cut interest rates three times during the year, moving from a stance of patience and neutrality to one more concerned with sustaining economic expansion. Worries about a global slowdown in GDP growth and the effect of trade wars were present throughout the year, and realized and implied volatilities increased sharply. Primary mortgage rates also moved lower, which had multiple effects on Agency RMBS including increased prepayment expectations and current coupon spread widening. At the same time, higher coupon RMBS performed well, as did prepay-protected securities.\nThe repo markets made headlines during the last half of the year. In response to the spike in overnight rates in September, the Fed established a series of term and overnight repo operations, and also began a series of Treasury bill purchases to rebuild its balance sheet and add reserves to the system. While rates remained elevated during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Fed's actions clearly stabilized the market. This was on display on the final day of the year, when overnight repo rates cleared below the Fed's target, which is highly unusual. Given the Fed's strong response, our expectation is that the funding markets will normalize over time.\nIn mortgage credit, home price appreciation has remained solid with around 3-4% growth year-over-year, and expectations are for continued slow but increasing home prices. We believe that increasing housing affordability can be a significant driver of total return performance for our legacy assets. While 10-year Treasury rates have fluctuated in a 200 basis point range since 2014, the effects of mortgage rates and income growth have conspired to keep overall affordability in a narrow range.\nWe believe our blended Agency and non-Agency securities portfolio and our investing expertise, as well as our operational capabilities to invest in MSR, will allow us to better navigate the dynamic mortgage market while future regulatory and policy activities take shape. Having a diversified portfolio allows us to mitigate a variety of risks, including interest rate and RMBS spread volatility.\nThe following table provides the carrying value of our investment portfolio by product type:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,763,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,665,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hybrid ARM\n</td> <td>14,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Agency\n</td> <td>27,778,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,685,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency Derivatives\n</td> <td>68,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior\n</td> <td>3,073,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,854,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mezzanine\n</td> <td>480,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>928,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-only securities\n</td> <td>74,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Non-Agency\n</td> <td>3,628,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,867,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights\n</td> <td>1,909,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,993,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,384,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,616,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates\nOur Agency RMBS portfolio is subject to inherent prepayment risk. We seek to offset a portion of our Agency pool exposure to prepayment speeds through our MSR and interest-only Agency RMBS portfolios. Generally, a decline in interest rates that leads to rising prepayment speeds will cause the market value of our RMBS purchased at a discount (including interest-only securities) and MSR to deteriorate, and our RMBS purchased at a premium to increase. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates increase and prepayments slow. The low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term. However, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, could cause prepayment speeds to increase on many RMBS, which could lead to less attractive reinvestment opportunities. Nonetheless, we believe our portfolio management approach, including our asset selection process, positions us to respond to a variety of market scenarios, including an overall faster prepayment environment.\nThe following table provides the three-month weighted average constant prepayment rate, or CPR, on our investment portfolio by type for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average CPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Agency securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we are unable to predict the movement in interest rates in 2020 and beyond, our diversified portfolio management strategy is intended to generate attractive yields with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles.\nOur Agency RMBS are collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage loans, or hybrid ARMs, which are mortgage loans that have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period and adjustable thereafter. Our Agency portfolio also includes securities with implicit or explicit prepayment protection, including lower loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $200,000 in initial principal balance), higher LTVs (securities collateralized by loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80%), certain geographic concentrations and lower FICO scores. Our overall allocation of Agency RMBS and holdings of pools with specific characteristics are viewed in the context of our aggregate rates strategy, including MSR and related derivative hedging instruments. Additionally, the selection of securities with certain attributes is driven by the perceived relative value of the securities, which factors in the opportunities in the marketplace, the cost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, Agency RMBS capital allocation reflects management's flexible approach to investing in the marketplace.\nThe following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by

We evaluate credit risk on our non-Agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process, which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk, including extensive initial modeling and scenario analysis. In addition, the discounted purchase prices paid for our non-Agency securities provide additional insulation from credit losses in the event we receive less than 100% of par on such assets. At purchase, we estimate the portion of the discount we do not expect to recover and factor that into our expected yield and accretion methodology. We may also record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a portion of our investment in a security to the extent we believe that the amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows. We review our non-Agency securities on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk-adjusted returns on such investments and through on-going asset surveillance. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, adversely impacting our operating results.\nCounterparty exposure and leverage ratio\nWe monitor counterparty exposure in our broker, banking and lending counterparties on a daily basis. We believe our broker and banking counterparties are well-capitalized organizations and we attempt to manage our cash balances across these organizations to reduce our exposure to any single counterparty.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had entered into repurchase agreements with 47 counterparties, 24 of which had outstanding balances at December 31, 2019. In addition, we held long-term secured advances from the FHLB, short- and long-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities, long-term term notes payable and long-term unsecured convertible senior notes. As of December 31, 2019, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 6.1:1.0.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $558.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $1.3 million of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and $1.6 billion of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $354.6 million of unpledged MSR. Overall, we had unused borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities of $1.2 billion. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided or the inability to meet lenders' eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. If borrowing rates and collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than if we carried higher leverage.\nWe also monitor exposure to our MSR counterparties. We may be required to make representations and warranties to investors in the loans underlying the MSR we own; however, some of our MSR were purchased on a bifurcated basis, meaning the representation and warranty obligations remain with the seller. If the representations and warranties we make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of our portfolio. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.\nProposed changes to LIBOR\nLIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark\u201d or reference rate\u201d for various commercial and financial contracts, including corporate and municipal bonds and loans, floating rate mortgages, asset-backed securities, consumer loans, and interest rate swaps and other derivatives. It is expected that a number of private-sector banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021 when their current reporting commitment ends, which could either cause LIBOR to stop publication immediately or cause LIBOR's regulator to determine that its quality has degraded to the degree that it is no longer representative of its underlying market. The U.S. and other countries are currently working to replace LIBOR with alternative reference rates. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Some market participants may continue to explore whether other U.S. dollar-based reference rates would be more appropriate for certain types of instruments. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR, and various organizations are currently working on industry wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. We have material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR and are monitoring this activity, evaluating the related risks and our exposure.\nSummary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders was $115.8 million and $248.2 million ($0.41 and $0.93 per diluted weighted average share) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders of $573.5 million and $109.7 million ($(2.31) and $(0.53) per diluted weighted average share) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were $59.0 million and net unrealized gains on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive income, net of tax, were $578.6 million, respectively. This, combined with GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders of $115.8 million and $248.2 million, resulted in comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders of $56.8 million and $826.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net unrealized gains on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive income, net of tax, were $265.5 million and net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive loss, net of tax were $233.9 million, respectively. This, combined with GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders of $573.5 million and $109.7 million, resulted in comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of $307.9 million and $343.6 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nOur book value per common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was $14.54 at December 31, 2019, an increase from $13.11 book value per common share at December 31, 2018. During this twelve month period, we issued 24,439,436 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $336.3 million and recognized comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders of $826.7 million, which drove the overall increase in book value in excess of the total distributions paid to common and preferred stockholders during the year.\nThe following tables present the components of

The analysis of our financial results during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is omitted from this Form 10-K and included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased from $252.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 to $238.4 million for the same period in 2019 due to purchases of lower coupon Agency RMBS, sales of higher coupon Agency RMBS and higher prepayments on Agency RMBS with unamortized premium. Interest income increased from $870.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $994.7 million for the same period in 2019 due to the growth of our Agency RMBS portfolio.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased from $162.3 million and $519.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, to $167.3 million and $714.3 million for the same periods in 2019 due to increased financing on AFS securities and on MSR due to portfolio growth, and the MSR securitization completed in 2019.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following tables present the components of interest income and average annualized net asset yield earned by asset type, the components of interest expense and average annualized cost of funds on borrowings incurred by liability and/or collateral type, and net interest income and average annualized net interest rate spread for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td>

Interest rates steadily increased throughout the year ended December 31, 2018 and remained generally flat throughout the first quarter of 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, interest rates began decreasing in anticipation of a rate cut by the Fed, which made its first rate cut of the year in August. The Fed subsequently made two more rate cuts in 2019 until rates stabilized toward the end of the year.\nThe decrease in yields on Agency AFS securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was predominantly driven by purchases of pools with lower yields and sales of pools with higher yields. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency AFS securities for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was the result of a decrease in average LIBOR through the respective periods. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily the result of the elevated repo/LIBOR spreads that persisted throughout the latter half of 2019.\nThe decrease in yields on non-Agency securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was driven by purchases of non-Agency securities at lower yields than our existing portfolio and the sale of higher yield bonds that we believed had realized their upside potential. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of non-Agency AFS securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was the result of lower borrowing spreads on the lower yielding securities.\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency Derivatives for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was the result of a decrease in average LIBOR through the respective periods. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency Derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily the result of the elevated repo/LIBOR spreads that persisted throughout the latter half of 2019.\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of MSR for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was the result of the issuance of term notes payable in June 2019, which incur lower amortization of deferred debt issuance costs due to their longer term to maturity and the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the termination of a financing facility and generally better financing terms offered by counterparties.\nOur convertible senior notes are unsecured and pay interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum. The cost of funds associated with our convertible senior notes for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was consistent.\nThe following tables present the components of the yield earned by investment type on our AFS securities portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross yield/stated coupon\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (premium amortization) discount accretion\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net yield (2)\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross yield/stated coupon\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (premium amortization) discount accretion\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net yield (2)\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives.

All Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities acquired on or after July 1, 2015 are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). \nWe do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that we believe have higher risk-adjusted returns. The decrease in change in unrealized gains on Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was due to lower prepayment expectations relative to prepayment expectations in the previous quarter. The increase in change in unrealized losses (decrease in gains) on Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was due to interest rates generally falling throughout the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to interest rates generally rising throughout the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in slower prepayment expectations.\nServicing Income\nThe following table presents the components of servicing income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>312,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ancillary and other fee income\n</td> <td>499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Float income\n</td> <td>17,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in servicing income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was the result of an increase in the size of our MSR portfolio.

The increase in loss on servicing asset for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was driven by decreases in interest rates, an increase in prepayment speed assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR, and higher portfolio runoff on a larger MSR portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(Loss) Gain on Interest Rate Swap, Cap and Swaption Agreements\nThe following table summarizes the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap, cap and swaption positions recognized during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest spread\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Early termination, agreement maturation and option expiration (losses) gains\n</td> <td>(1,495\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unrealized loss on interest rate swap, cap and swaption agreements, at fair value\n</td> <td>(10,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(219,066\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(273,732\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,581\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on interest rate swap, cap and swaption agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(239,492\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(108,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest spread recognized for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps and caps results from receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate and paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on positions held to economically hedge/mitigate portfolio interest rate exposure (or duration) risk. We may elect to terminate certain swaps, caps and swaptions to align with our investment portfolio, agreements may mature or options may expire resulting in full settlement of our net interest spread asset/liability and the recognition of realized gains and losses, including early termination penalties. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps, caps and swaptions during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates. Since swaps, caps and swaptions are used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities.\n(Loss) Gain on Other Derivative Instruments\nThe following table provides a summary of the total (loss) gain recognized on other derivative instruments we hold for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, Markit IOS total return swaps, short U.S. treasuries, U.S. Treasury futures and inverse interest-only securities during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net of accretion, on inverse interest-only securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on short U.S. treasuries\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments (1)\n</td> <td>(12,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,018\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on other derivative instruments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,800\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,857\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments. \nFor further details regarding our use of derivative instruments and related activity, refer to Note 7 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Income\nWe recorded other income of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and $0.3 million and $3.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease in other income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was driven by losses on extinguishment of debt and lower dividend income on our FHLB stock due to a decrease in the average balance held.\nExpenses\nThe following table presents the components of expenses, excluding nonrecurring transaction expenses, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except share data)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Officers' compensation incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us\n</td> <td>4,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity compensation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of executive officers' restricted stock (2)\n</td> <td>1,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of other restricted stock\n</td> <td>1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-cash equity compensation expenses\n</td> <td>2,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other operating expenses\n</td> <td>7,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized other operating expense ratio\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized other operating expense ratio, excluding non-cash equity compensation expenses\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) Officers include our principal financial officer and general counsel. We do not reimburse PRCM Advisers for any expenses related to the compensation of our chief executive officer or chief investment officer. \n (2) Equity based compensation expense related to the amortization of restricted stock awarded to our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel. \nManagement fees are payable to PRCM Advisers, our external manager, under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. In connection with the acquisition of CYS effective July 31, 2018, the management agreement was amended to (i) reduce PRCM Advisers' base management fee with respect to the additional equity under management resulting from the merger to 0.75% from the effective time through the first anniversary of the effective time and (ii) for the fiscal quarter in which closing of the merger occurred, to make a one-time downward adjustment of Pine River's management fees payable by Two Harbors for such quarter by $15.0 million to offset the cash consideration payable to stockholders of CYS, plus an additional downward adjustment of up to $3.3 million for certain transaction-related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the total one-time downward adjustment to management fees was $17.5 million. Effective July 31, 2019, the management fee reduction on the equity acquired in the CYS transaction expired. We do not anticipate any further downward adjustments to management fees for transaction-related expenses.\nWe also incur servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of MSR and other operating expenses. The increase in servicing expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was largely the result of an increase in the size of our MSR portfolio. Included in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us, including compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our activities in accordance with the management agreement; we do not reimburse PRCM Advisers for any expenses related to the compensation of our chief executive officer or chief investment officer.\nWe have direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services, technology and certain office lease payments, but most of our expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nAcquisition Transaction Costs\nThe acquisition of CYS was treated as an asset purchase under U.S. GAAP. Given there were no meaningful nonfinancial assets and non-current assets acquired in the merger with CYS and no identified intangible assets to assign value, the excess consideration and costs associated with the transaction were recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as acquisition transaction costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these acquisition transaction costs totaled approximately $86.7 million.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn connection with the acquisition of CYS, we incurred restructuring charges, including termination benefits, contract terminations and other associated costs, of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of $2.4 million and $13.6 million, respectively, which was primarily due to losses recognized on MSR, offset by net gains recognized on derivative instruments held in the Company's TRSs. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our TRSs recognized a provision for income taxes of $6.7 million and $41.8 million, which was primarily due to realized gains on sales of AFS securities and gains recognized on MSR held in the TRSs as well as the write-down of net deferred tax assets resulting from the deemed liquidation of one of our TRSs due to its TRS election revocation, offset by net losses incurred on derivative instruments held in the TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nFinancial Condition\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value\nAgency RMBS\nOur Agency RMBS AFS portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS AFS were Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations that carry an implied rating of AAA,\u201d or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. government. The majority of these securities consist of whole pools in which we own all of the investment interests in the securities.\nThe tables below summarize certain characteristics of our Agency RMBS AFS at

We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve, as there remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays.\nDue to acquisitions of legacy\u201d non-Agency securities, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount increased from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 (as disclosed in Note 4 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). From December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount increased from 65.6% to 75.3%.\nA subprime bond may generally be considered higher risk; however, if purchased at a discount that reflects a high expectation of credit losses, it could be viewed as less risky than a prime bond, which is subject to unanticipated credit loss performance. Accordingly, we believe our risk profile in owning a heavily discounted subprime bond with known delinquencies affords us the ability to assume a higher percentage of expected credit loss with comparable risk-adjusted returns to a less discounted prime bond with a lower percentage of expected credit loss.\nThe following tables present certain information by investment type and, if

Proceeds received for each security are dependent on the position of the individual security within the structure of each deal. \n (4) Constant default rate, or CDR, represents the percentage of outstanding principal balances in the pool that are in default. \n (5) Severity rates reflect the amount of loss expected from a foreclosure and liquidation of the underlying collateral in the mortgage loan pool. \n (6) Represents the percentage of cumulative losses to date on the underlying loans. \nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Substantially all of our Agency RMBS are currently pledged as collateral, and the majority of our non-Agency securities have been pledged as collateral, either through repurchase agreements or FHLB advances.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we formed a new trust entity, or the Issuer Trust, for the purpose of financing MSR through securitization. On June 27, 2019, we, through the Issuer Trust, completed an MSR securitization transaction pursuant to which, through two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, MSR is pledged to the Issuer Trust and in return, the Issuer Trust issued (a) an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in term notes to qualified institutional buyers and (b) a variable funding note, or VFN, with a maximum principal balance of $1.0 billion to one of the subsidiaries, in each case secured on a pari passu basis. The term notes bear interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 2.80% per annum. The term notes will mature on June 25, 2024 or, if extended pursuant to the terms of the related indenture supplement, June 25, 2026 (unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms).\nAdditionally, on January 19, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% convertible senior notes due 2022. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $282.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The majority of these proceeds were used to help fund our MSR assets, which previously had largely been funded with cash.\nAt December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, borrowings under repurchase

that we define as comprehensive income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, excluding realized and unrealized gains and losses\u201d (impairment losses, realized and unrealized gains and losses on the aggregate portfolio, reserve expense for representation and warranty obligations on MSR and non-cash compensation expense related to restricted common stock). As defined, Core Earnings, including dollar roll income, includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments and servicing income, net of estimated amortization on MSR. Dollar roll income is the economic equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Core Earnings, including dollar roll income, provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing the Company's results of operations and helps facilitate comparisons to industry peers. \n (2) Beginning with the period ended June 30, 2019, the Company refined the MSR amortization method utilized in the calculation of Core Earnings, including dollar roll income. The new method includes an adjustment for any gain or loss on the capital used to purchase the MSR and allows Core Earnings to better reflect how the carry earned on MSR varies as a function of prepayment rates. \nU.S. GAAP to Estimated Taxable Income\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of our GAAP net income (loss) to our estimated taxable income (loss) split between our REIT and

recorded in 2019 include dividends paid from the Company's TRSs to the REIT. Additionally, permanent tax differences recorded in both 2019 and 2018 include a recurring difference related to the intercompany sales of RMBS and a recurring difference in compensation expense related to restricted stock dividends. Temporary differences are principally timing differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting related to unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments, realized and unrealized gains and losses from MSR and accretion and amortization from Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018, there were both permanent and temporary tax differences resulting from the treatment of transaction costs and related expenses from the merger with CYS.\nChange in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities, do not impact our GAAP net (loss) income or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted for as trading instruments.\nDividends\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared cash dividends totaling $1.67 per share. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders, subject to certain distribution requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our board of directors elected to distribute the majority of our taxable income to avoid U.S. Federal Income taxes. As such, temporary differences between GAAP net income (loss) and taxable income can generate deterioration in book value on a permanent and temporary basis as taxable income is distributed that has not been earned for U.S. GAAP purposes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecasted on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could negatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls. We also believe that it gives us the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities and term notes payable to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\nOn March 21, 2019, we completed a public offering of 18,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.76 per share. On March 22, 2019, an additional 2,700,000 shares were sold to the underwriters of the offering pursuant to an overallotment option. The net proceeds were approximately $284.5 million, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $0.3 million.\nTo the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, MSR and other target assets and for other general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $558.1 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; $33.5 billion of AFS securities, MSR, and derivative assets held at fair value; and $30.3 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, increased from 5.3:10 to 6.1:1.0 and increased from 5.8:1.0 to 6.1:1.0, respectively. The increase was driven by increased financing on Agency RMBS purchases. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our economic debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes and implied debt on net TBA notional, increased from 7.2:10 to 7.5:1.0 for both periods.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $1.3 million of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and $1.6 billion of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $354.6 million of unpledged MSR. Overall, we had unused borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities of $1.2 billion, which includes the repurchase facility pursuant to which the Company may finance the VFN issued in connection with the MSR securitization transaction completed on June 27, 2019. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided or the inability to meet lenders' eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity. If borrowing rates and/or collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more leveraged organization.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not experience any restrictions to our funding sources, although balance sheet capacity of counterparties have tightened due to compliance with the Basel III regulatory capital reform rules as well as management of perceived risk in the current interest rate environment. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable, convertible notes and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had master repurchase agreements in place with 47 counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate additional counterparties to manage and optimize counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional assets or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and counterparty geographical concentration at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Counterparty Exposure(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Funding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Counterparty Exposure(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Funding\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,165,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,026,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,061,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,120,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe (2)\n</td> <td>7,519,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,728,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>646,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia (2)\n</td> <td>5,463,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,343,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,147,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,782,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,133,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,022,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) Represents the net carrying value of the assets sold under agreements to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or assets on deposit to secure the repurchase obligation, less the amount of the repurchase liability, including accrued interest. \n (2) Exposure to European and Asian domiciled banks and their U.S. subsidiaries. \nIn addition to our master repurchase agreements to fund our Agency and non-Agency securities, we have two repurchase facilities and one revolving credit facility that provide short- and long-term financing for our MSR portfolio.

As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. As of December 31, 2019, TH Insurance had $210.0 million in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of 2.00%.\nThe ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. Each advance requires approval by the FHLB and is secured by collateral in accordance with the FHLB's credit and collateral guidelines, as may be revised from time to time by the FHLB. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, Agency RMBS and certain non-Agency securities with a rating of A and above.\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the final rule excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a membership grace period that runs through February 19, 2021, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited; however, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to 40% of its total assets.\nWe are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represent the most restrictive financial covenants across the agreements as of December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 Total indebtedness to tangible net worth must be less than 8.0:1.0. As of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness to tangible net worth, as defined, was 6.2:1.0. \n \u2022 Cash liquidity must be greater than $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, our liquidity, as defined, was $558.1 million. \n \u2022 Net worth must be greater than $1.5 billion or 50% of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior, whichever is higher. As of December 31, 2019, 50% of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior was $2.6 billion and our net worth, as defined, was $5.0 billion.  We are also subject to additional financial covenants in connection with various other agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business. We intend to continue to operate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants.\nThe following table summarizes assets at carrying values that were pledged or restricted as collateral for the future payment obligations of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and derivative instruments at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale securities, at fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,802,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,157,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights, at fair value\n</td> <td>1,554,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,143,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>919,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due from counterparties\n</td> <td>102,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative assets, at fair value\n</td> <td>68,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasuries, at fair value (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,447,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,905,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) U.S. Treasuries received as collateral and re-pledged. \nAlthough we generally intend to hold our target assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of our assets in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. Our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities are generally actively traded and thus, in most circumstances, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including MSR, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as MSR may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain regulatory approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with regulatory requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our MSR, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises.\nIn addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities and term notes payable, a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources.\nThe following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Within 30 days\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,465,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,488,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 to 59 days\n</td> <td>6,300,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,077,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>60 to 89 days\n</td> <td>6,687,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,655,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>90 to 119 days\n</td> <td>4,740,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,938,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>120 to 364 days\n</td> <td>6,113,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,508,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One to three years\n</td> <td>584,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three to five years\n</td> <td>394,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five to ten years\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ten years and over\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,336,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,592,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our restricted and unrestricted cash balance increased approximately $519.1 million to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The cash movements can be summarized by the following:\n \u2022 Cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities increased our cash balances by approximately $1.1 billion, primarily driven by our financial results for the year. \n \u2022 Cash flows from investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, investing activities decreased our cash balances by approximately $6.1 billion, primarily driven by purchases of MSR and AFS securities. \n \u2022 Cash flows from financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, financing activities increased our cash balance by approximately $5.5 billion, primarily driven by increases in repurchase agreements as a result of purchases of AFS securities. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not participated in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, convertible senior notes, interest expense on borrowings, our non-cancelable office leases, net of contractual subleases, and management fees payable under our management agreement:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Due During the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,147,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,147,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td>160,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facilities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on borrowings(1)\n</td> <td>153,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>1,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fee - PRCM Advisers(2)\n</td> <td>245,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,708,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,385,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) Interest expense on borrowings calculated based on rates at December 31, 2019. \n (2) Contractual obligation for the management fee is estimated through the contract expiration date of October 28, 2020, inclusive of the termination fee as defined in the management agreement between us and PRCM Advisers. Disclosure assumes the agreement is not renewed pursuant to its terms and that the effective termination date is October 28, 2020. \nWe are party to a management agreement with PRCM Advisers, pursuant to which PRCM Advisers is entitled to receive a management fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses from us. We reimburse PRCM Advisers for (i) our allocable share of the compensation paid by PRCM Advisers to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and personnel employed by PRCM Advisers as in-house legal, tax, accounting, consulting, auditing, administrative, information technology, valuation, computer programming and development and back-office resources to us, and (ii) any amounts for personnel of PRCM Advisers' affiliates arising under a shared facilities and services agreement. We also have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for data services and technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nWe are also party to contracts that contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with brokers, underwriters, counterparties to lending agreements and investors in the RMBS we issued in connection with our previous residential mortgage loan securitization transactions, the term notes we issued in connection with our MSR securitization and the loans\nunderlying our MSR. The maximum potential future payment amount we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nInflation\nSubstantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.\nOther Matters\nWe intend to conduct our business so as to maintain our exempt status under, and not to become regulated as, an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we failed to maintain our exempt status under the 1940 Act and became regulated as an investment company, our ability to, among other things, use leverage would be substantially reduced and, as a result, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in Item 1, Business - Other Business - Regulation\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, we monitor our compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Tests of the 1940 Act in order to maintain our exempt status. As of December 31, 2019, we determined that we maintained compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Test requirements.\nWe calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code for the year ended December 31, 2019. We also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the 75% source of income test and for the 95% source of income test rules for the year ended December 31, 2019. Consequently, we met the REIT income and asset tests. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income. Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nThe TCJA made many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to businesses, including REITs and TRSs. Pursuant to the TCJA, as of January 1, 2018, the federal income tax rate applicable to corporations was reduced to 21% and the corporate alternative minimum tax was repealed. In addition, the deduction of net interest expense is limited for all businesses; provided that certain businesses, including real estate businesses, may elect not to be subject to such limitations and instead to depreciate their real property related assets over longer depreciable lives. This limitation could adversely affect our TRSs.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral\nWe are a Maryland corporation focused on investing in and managing Agency residential mortgage-backed securities, or Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We are externally managed by PRCM Advisers LLC, or PRCM Advisers, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine River Capital Management L.P., or Pine River.\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following:\n \u2022 Agency RMBS (which includes inverse interest-only Agency securities classified as Agency Derivatives\u201d for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP), meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (or Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (or Fannie Mae), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac), or collectively, the government sponsored entities, or GSEs; \n \u2022 Non-Agency securities, meaning securities that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; \n \u2022 MSR; and \n \u2022 Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio.  We generally view our target assets in two strategies that are based on our core competencies of understanding and managing prepayment and credit risk. Our rates strategy includes assets that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds, specifically Agency RMBS and MSR. Our credit strategy includes assets that are primarily sensitive to changes in inherent credit risk, including non-Agency securities. Other assets include financial and mortgage-related assets other than the target assets in our rates and credit strategies, including certain non-hedging transactions that may produce non-qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests.\nWithin our MSR business, we purchase the right to control the servicing of residential mortgage loans and the obligation to service the loans in accordance with relevant standards from high-quality originators. We do not directly service the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with appropriately licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer.\nOn April 26, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we would acquire CYS Investments, Inc., or CYS, a Maryland corporation investing in primarily Agency RMBS and treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The transaction was approved by the stockholders of both Two Harbors and CYS on July 27, 2018, and the merger was completed on July 31, 2018, at which time CYS became our wholly owned subsidiary. In exchange for all of the shares of CYS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, we issued approximately 72.6 million new shares of common stock, as well as aggregate cash consideration of $15.0 million, to CYS common stockholders. In addition, we issued 3 million shares of newly classified Series D cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 8 million shares of newly classified Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock in exchange for all shares of CYS's Series A and Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding prior to the effective time of the merger. The financial results of CYS since the closing date of the acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe our investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the mortgage market, with a focus on asset selection and the implementation of a relative value investment approach. In making our capital allocation decisions, we take into consideration a number of factors, including the opportunities available in the marketplace, the cost and availability of financing, and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, capital allocation reflects management's flexible approach to investing in the marketplace. The following table provides our capital allocation in each of our investment strategies as of December 31, 2019 and the four immediately preceding quarter-ends:\n\n____________________\n (1) Capital allocation percentages reflect management's assessment regarding the extent to which each asset class contributes to total portfolio risk. Does not represent funding allocation or balance sheet financing of such assets. \nAs our capital allocation shifts, our annualized yields and cost of financing will also shift. At December 31, 2019, our capital allocation was 78% to our rates strategy and 22% to our credit strategy. Going forward, we intend to allocate capital to the most attractive investment opportunities in our target asset classes. We do not have a fixed allocation target between our rates and credit strategies. Our investment decisions are not driven solely by annualized yields, but rather a multitude of macroeconomic drivers, including market environments and their respective impacts (e.g., uncertainty of prepayment speeds, extension risk and credit events).\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2019, our net yield realized on the portfolio was slightly higher than the prior quarter, but lower than recent periods due to purchases of lower coupon/sales of higher coupon Agency RMBS and higher prepays on Agency RMBS, offset by a decrease in our cost of financing due to decreases in LIBOR. The following table provides the average annualized yield on our assets, including Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities and MSR for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\n\n____________________\n (1) Average annualized yield includes interest income on Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities and servicing income, net of amortization and servicing expenses on MSR and incorporates future prepayment, credit loss and other assumptions, all of which are estimates and subject to change. \n (2) Cost of financing includes swap and cap interest rate spread. \nWe seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB. We also finance our MSR through repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes.\nOur Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while non-Agency securities and MSR, with less liquidity and/or more exposure to credit risk and prepayment, utilize lower levels of leverage. As a result, our debt-to-equity ratio is determined by our portfolio mix as well as many additional factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the availability and price of our financing, the diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. Over the past several quarters, we have generally maintained a debt-to-equity ratio range of 5.0 to 6.0 times to finance our securities portfolio and MSR, on a fully deployed capital basis. Our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the composition of our portfolio; specifically, the higher percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio is, while the higher percentage of non-Agency securities and MSR we hold, the lower our debt-to-equity ratio is. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from offerings we conduct. As we allocate capital toward Agency RMBS and deploy financing on MSR, our debt-to-equity ratio may increase beyond 6.0 times in the future. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Repurchase Agreements\u201d for further discussion.\nWe recognize that investing in our target assets is competitive and we compete with other entities for attractive investment opportunities. We rely on our management team and our dedicated team of investment professionals provided by our external manager to identify investment opportunities. We believe that our significant focus in the residential market, the extensive mortgage market expertise of our investment team, our strong analytics and our disciplined relative value investment approach give us a competitive advantage versus our peers.\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. While we do not currently originate or service residential mortgage loans, certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to own and manage MSR.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\nOur net interest income includes income from our securities portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of subservicing expenses, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results will also be affected by default rates and credit losses with respect to the mortgage loans underlying our non-Agency securities.\nFair Value Measurement\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and, therefore, our consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss) are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At December 31, 2019, approximately 93.3% of our total assets, or $33.5 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See Note 10 - Fair Value to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices.\nAny temporary change in the fair value of our available-for-sale, or AFS, securities, excluding certain Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and does not impact our earnings. Our reported earnings (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss), is affected, however, by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, including interest rate swap, cap and swaption agreements and certain other derivative instruments (i.e., TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, U.S. Treasury futures, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities), which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and MSR.\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire investment portfolio reported at fair value is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing vendors. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other securities, including interest-only Agency RMBS, inverse interest-only Agency RMBS, and non-Agency securities. We also receive three vendor quotes for the MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing vendors and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset periods, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For non-Agency securities, the third-party pricing vendors utilize both observable and unobservable inputs such as pool-specific characteristics (e.g., loan age, loan size, credit quality of borrowers, vintage, servicer quality), floating rate indices, prepayment and default assumptions, and recent trading of the same or similar securities. For MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, geographical location, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields and trading levels. Pricing vendors will customarily incorporate loan servicing cost, servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment.\nWe evaluate the prices we receive from both third-party brokers and pricing vendors by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge valuations from third-party brokers and pricing vendors to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of MSR based upon the average of prices received from third-party vendors, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures.\nWe utilize bid side\u201d pricing for our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the bid-offer\u201d spread. To the extent that this occurs, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets. The Company classified 6.0% of its total assets as Level 3 fair value assets at December 31, 2019.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities and MSR may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use inputs that are current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market dislocation, may have reduced transparency.\nClassification and Valuation of Available-for-Sale Securities\nOur securities investments consist primarily of Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities that we classify as available-for-sale, or AFS. All assets classified as AFS, excluding certain Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities, are reported at estimated fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity, on an after-tax basis. On July 1, 2015, we elected the fair value option for Agency interest-only securities acquired on or after such date. All Agency interest-only securities acquired on or after July 1, 2015 are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nWhen the estimated fair value of an AFS security is less than amortized cost, we consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of the security that is required to be recognized in GAAP net income (loss). The determination of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors. Consideration is given to whether we (i) have the intent to sell the investment securities, (ii) are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery, or (iii) do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities. Investments with unrealized losses are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired if we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time, to maturity if necessary, sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the amortized cost basis of the investments. If an impairment is determined to be solely driven by the inability to fully recover the entire amortized cost basis over the remaining life of the security, the security is further analyzed for credit loss (the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis). The credit loss, if any, is then recognized in GAAP net income (loss), while the balance of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nClassification and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe account for our MSR at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income (loss), rather than at amortized cost. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors. Although MSR transactions are observable in the marketplace, the details of those transactions are not necessarily reflective of the value of our MSR portfolio. Third-party vendors use both observable market data and unobservable market data (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, discount rates and cost to service) as inputs into models, which help to inform their best estimates of fair value market price.\nInterest Income Recognition\nOur interest income on our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method, as adjusted for actual prepayments. We estimate prepayments for our Agency interest-only securities, which represent our right to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest flows of specific Agency and collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMO, securities. As a result, if prepayments increase (or are expected to increase), we will accelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums. Conversely, if prepayments decrease (or are expected to decrease), we will decelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums.\nOur interest income on our non-Agency securities rated below AA, including unrated securities, is recognized in accordance with estimated cash flows. Cash flows from a security are estimated by applying assumptions used to determine the fair value of such security and the excess of the future cash flows over the investment are recognized as interest income under the effective yield method. We review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections at least quarterly and monitor these projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in interest income recognized on, or the carrying value of, such securities.\nFor non-Agency securities purchased at a discount, we account for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from our initial investment in debt securities acquired if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. We limit the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of an estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest, and other cash flows (cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected) over the initial investment. The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected (nonaccretable difference or designated credit reserve) is not recognized as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield over the remaining life of the security. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairments.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. The fair value adjustments of our current derivative instruments affect net income as the hedge for accounting purposes is being treated as an economic, or trading, hedge and not as a qualifying hedging instrument.\nDerivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. We utilize third-party pricing vendors and broker quotes to value our financial derivative instruments. If our hedging activities do not achieve their desired results, our reported GAAP net income (loss) may be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nOur financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes, except for those taxable benefits or provisions recognized by our TRSs. We estimate, based on existence of sufficient evidence, the ability to realize the remainder of any deferred tax asset our TRSs recognize. Any adjustments to such estimates will be made in the period such determination is made. We plan to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT. As a result of our expected REIT qualification, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level taxes. However, many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( TCJA\u201d) significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The TCJA requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the TCJA and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. Technical corrections or other amendments of the TCJA or administrative guidance interpreting the TCJA may be forthcoming at any time. While we do not anticipate a material effect on our operations, we continue to analyze and monitor the application of the TCJA to our business, our peers and the economic environment.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\n2019 delivered a significant drop in interest rates across the curve. In addition, the Federal Reserve, or Fed, cut interest rates three times during the year, moving from a stance of patience and neutrality to one more concerned with sustaining economic expansion. Worries about a global slowdown in GDP growth and the effect of trade wars were present throughout the year, and realized and implied volatilities increased sharply. Primary mortgage rates also moved lower, which had multiple effects on Agency RMBS including increased prepayment expectations and current coupon spread widening. At the same time, higher coupon RMBS performed well, as did prepay-protected securities.\nThe repo markets made headlines during the last half of the year. In response to the spike in overnight rates in September, the Fed established a series of term and overnight repo operations, and also began a series of Treasury bill purchases to rebuild its balance sheet and add reserves to the system. While rates remained elevated during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Fed's actions clearly stabilized the market. This was on display on the final day of the year, when overnight repo rates cleared below the Fed's target, which is highly unusual. Given the Fed's strong response, our expectation is that the funding markets will normalize over time.\nIn mortgage credit, home price appreciation has remained solid with around 3-4% growth year-over-year, and expectations are for continued slow but increasing home prices. We believe that increasing housing affordability can be a significant driver of total return performance for our legacy assets. While 10-year Treasury rates have fluctuated in a 200 basis point range since 2014, the effects of mortgage rates and income growth have conspired to keep overall affordability in a narrow range.\nWe believe our blended Agency and non-Agency securities portfolio and our investing expertise, as well as our operational capabilities to invest in MSR, will allow us to better navigate the dynamic mortgage market while future regulatory and policy activities take shape. Having a diversified portfolio allows us to mitigate a variety of risks, including interest rate and RMBS spread volatility.\nThe following table provides the carrying value of our investment portfolio by product type:\n\nPrepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates\nOur Agency RMBS portfolio is subject to inherent prepayment risk. We seek to offset a portion of our Agency pool exposure to prepayment speeds through our MSR and interest-only Agency RMBS portfolios. Generally, a decline in interest rates that leads to rising prepayment speeds will cause the market value of our RMBS purchased at a discount (including interest-only securities) and MSR to deteriorate, and our RMBS purchased at a premium to increase. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates increase and prepayments slow. The low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term. However, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, could cause prepayment speeds to increase on many RMBS, which could lead to less attractive reinvestment opportunities. Nonetheless, we believe our portfolio management approach, including our asset selection process, positions us to respond to a variety of market scenarios, including an overall faster prepayment environment.\nThe following table provides the three-month weighted average constant prepayment rate, or CPR, on our investment portfolio by type for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\n\nAlthough we are unable to predict the movement in interest rates in 2020 and beyond, our diversified portfolio management strategy is intended to generate attractive yields with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles.\nOur Agency RMBS are collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage loans, or hybrid ARMs, which are mortgage loans that have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period and adjustable thereafter. Our Agency portfolio also includes securities with implicit or explicit prepayment protection, including lower loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $200,000 in initial principal balance), higher LTVs (securities collateralized by loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80%), certain geographic concentrations and lower FICO scores. Our overall allocation of Agency RMBS and holdings of pools with specific characteristics are viewed in the context of our aggregate rates strategy, including MSR and related derivative hedging instruments. Additionally, the selection of securities with certain attributes is driven by the perceived relative value of the securities, which factors in the opportunities in the marketplace, the cost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, Agency RMBS capital allocation reflects management's flexible approach to investing in the marketplace.\nThe following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by underlying mortgage loan rate type:\n\n\nOur non-Agency securities yields are expected to increase if prepayment rates on such assets exceed our prepayment assumptions. To the extent that prepayment speeds increase due to macroeconomic factors, we expect to benefit from the ability to recognize the income from the heavily discounted prices that principally arose from credit or payment default expectations.\nThe following tables provide net unamortized discount/premium information on our non-Agency securities portfolio:\n\n\nCredit losses\nAlthough our Agency portfolio is supported by U.S. government agency and federally chartered corporation guarantees of payment of principal and interest, we are exposed to credit risk in our non-Agency securities.\nThe credit support built into non-Agency securities deal structures is designed to provide a level of protection from potential credit losses for more senior tranches. We evaluate credit risk on our non-Agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process, which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk, including extensive initial modeling and scenario analysis. In addition, the discounted purchase prices paid for our non-Agency securities provide additional insulation from credit losses in the event we receive less than 100% of par on such assets. At purchase, we estimate the portion of the discount we do not expect to recover and factor that into our expected yield and accretion methodology. We may also record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a portion of our investment in a security to the extent we believe that the amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows. We review our non-Agency securities on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk-adjusted returns on such investments and through on-going asset surveillance. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, adversely impacting our operating results.\nCounterparty exposure and leverage ratio\nWe monitor counterparty exposure in our broker, banking and lending counterparties on a daily basis. We believe our broker and banking counterparties are well-capitalized organizations and we attempt to manage our cash balances across these organizations to reduce our exposure to any single counterparty.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had entered into repurchase agreements with 47 counterparties, 24 of which had outstanding balances at December 31, 2019. In addition, we held long-term secured advances from the FHLB, short- and long-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities, long-term term notes payable and long-term unsecured convertible senior notes. As of December 31, 2019, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 6.1:1.0.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $558.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $1.3 million of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and $1.6 billion of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $354.6 million of unpledged MSR. Overall, we had unused borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities of $1.2 billion. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided or the inability to meet lenders' eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. If borrowing rates and collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than if we carried higher leverage.\nWe also monitor exposure to our MSR counterparties. We may be required to make representations and warranties to investors in the loans underlying the MSR we own; however, some of our MSR were purchased on a bifurcated basis, meaning the representation and warranty obligations remain with the seller. If the representations and warranties we make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of our portfolio. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.\nProposed changes to LIBOR\nLIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark\u201d or reference rate\u201d for various commercial and financial contracts, including corporate and municipal bonds and loans, floating rate mortgages, asset-backed securities, consumer loans, and interest rate swaps and other derivatives. It is expected that a number of private-sector banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021 when their current reporting commitment ends, which could either cause LIBOR to stop publication immediately or cause LIBOR's regulator to determine that its quality has degraded to the degree that it is no longer representative of its underlying market. The U.S. and other countries are currently working to replace LIBOR with alternative reference rates. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Some market participants may continue to explore whether other U.S. dollar-based reference rates would be more appropriate for certain types of instruments. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR, and various organizations are currently working on industry wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. We have material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR and are monitoring this activity, evaluating the related risks and our exposure.\nSummary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders was $115.8 million and $248.2 million ($0.41 and $0.93 per diluted weighted average share) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders of $573.5 million and $109.7 million ($(2.31) and $(0.53) per diluted weighted average share) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were $59.0 million and net unrealized gains on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive income, net of tax, were $578.6 million, respectively. This, combined with GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders of $115.8 million and $248.2 million, resulted in comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders of $56.8 million and $826.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net unrealized gains on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive income, net of tax, were $265.5 million and net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive loss, net of tax were $233.9 million, respectively. This, combined with GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders of $573.5 million and $109.7 million, resulted in comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of $307.9 million and $343.6 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nOur book value per common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was $14.54 at December 31, 2019, an increase from $13.11 book value per common share at December 31, 2018. During this twelve month period, we issued 24,439,436 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $336.3 million and recognized comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders of $826.7 million, which drove the overall increase in book value in excess of the total distributions paid to common and preferred stockholders during the year.\nThe following tables present the components of our comprehensive income (loss) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017:\n\n\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following analysis focuses on financial results during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The analysis of our financial results during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is omitted from this Form 10-K and included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased from $252.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 to $238.4 million for the same period in 2019 due to purchases of lower coupon Agency RMBS, sales of higher coupon Agency RMBS and higher prepayments on Agency RMBS with unamortized premium. Interest income increased from $870.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $994.7 million for the same period in 2019 due to the growth of our Agency RMBS portfolio.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased from $162.3 million and $519.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, to $167.3 million and $714.3 million for the same periods in 2019 due to increased financing on AFS securities and on MSR due to portfolio growth, and the MSR securitization completed in 2019.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following tables present the components of interest income and average annualized net asset yield earned by asset type, the components of interest expense and average annualized cost of funds on borrowings incurred by liability and/or collateral type, and net interest income and average annualized net interest rate spread for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\n\n____________________\n (1) Average asset balance represents average amortized cost on AFS securities and Agency Derivatives. \n (2) Cost of funds does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps and caps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in (loss) gain on interest rate swap, cap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our total average cost of funds on the assets assigned as collateral for borrowings shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps and caps, was 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, compared to 2.5% and 2.2% for the same periods in 2018. \n (3) Yields on Agency Derivatives not shown as interest income is included in gain (loss) on other derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). \n (4) Yields on mortgage servicing rights not shown as these assets do not earn interest. \n (5) Net interest spread does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps and caps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in gain (loss) on interest rate swap, cap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our total average net interest rate spread on the assets and liabilities shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps and caps, was 0.9% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to 1.4% and 1.6% for the same periods in 2018. \nAs previously discussed, our yields and cost of funds are impacted by changes in market interest rates and spreads as well as changes in the mix of our portfolio and financing sources. Interest rates steadily increased throughout the year ended December 31, 2018 and remained generally flat throughout the first quarter of 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, interest rates began decreasing in anticipation of a rate cut by the Fed, which made its first rate cut of the year in August. The Fed subsequently made two more rate cuts in 2019 until rates stabilized toward the end of the year.\nThe decrease in yields on Agency AFS securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was predominantly driven by purchases of pools with lower yields and sales of pools with higher yields. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency AFS securities for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was the result of a decrease in average LIBOR through the respective periods. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily the result of the elevated repo/LIBOR spreads that persisted throughout the latter half of 2019.\nThe decrease in yields on non-Agency securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was driven by purchases of non-Agency securities at lower yields than our existing portfolio and the sale of higher yield bonds that we believed had realized their upside potential. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of non-Agency AFS securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was the result of lower borrowing spreads on the lower yielding securities.\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency Derivatives for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was the result of a decrease in average LIBOR through the respective periods. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency Derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily the result of the elevated repo/LIBOR spreads that persisted throughout the latter half of 2019.\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of MSR for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was the result of the issuance of term notes payable in June 2019, which incur lower amortization of deferred debt issuance costs due to their longer term to maturity and the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the termination of a financing facility and generally better financing terms offered by counterparties.\nOur convertible senior notes are unsecured and pay interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum. The cost of funds associated with our convertible senior notes for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was consistent.\nThe following tables present the components of the yield earned by investment type on our AFS securities portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\n\n____________________\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the average annualized net yield on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 2.9% and 3.3%, respectively, compared to 3.3% and 3.2% for the same periods in 2018. \n (2) These yields have not been adjusted for cost of delay and cost to carry purchase premiums. \nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments\nWe review each of our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an OTTI charge is necessary. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded the following other-than-temporary credit impairments on non-Agency securities where the future expected cash flows for each security were less than its amortized cost:\n\nFor further information about evaluating AFS securities for OTTI, refer to Note 4 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nGain (Loss) On Investment Securities\nThe following tables present the components of gain (loss) on investment securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\n\n____________________\n (1) On July 1, 2015, we elected the fair value option for Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities acquired on or after such date. All Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities acquired on or after July 1, 2015 are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). \nWe do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that we believe have higher risk-adjusted returns. The decrease in change in unrealized gains on Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was due to lower prepayment expectations relative to prepayment expectations in the previous quarter. The increase in change in unrealized losses (decrease in gains) on Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was due to interest rates generally falling throughout the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to interest rates generally rising throughout the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in slower prepayment expectations.\nServicing Income\nThe following table presents the components of servicing income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nThe increase in servicing income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was the result of an increase in the size of our MSR portfolio. Additionally, the increase in float income was the result of both the increased size of our MSR portfolio and increased float earning rates.\nLoss on Servicing Asset\nThe following table presents the components of loss on servicing asset for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nThe decrease in loss on servicing asset for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was driven by a decrease in expected prepayment speed assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR, offset by higher portfolio runoff on a larger MSR portfolio during the three months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in loss on servicing asset for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was driven by decreases in interest rates, an increase in prepayment speed assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR, and higher portfolio runoff on a larger MSR portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(Loss) Gain on Interest Rate Swap, Cap and Swaption Agreements\nThe following table summarizes the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap, cap and swaption positions recognized during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nNet interest spread recognized for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps and caps results from receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate and paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on positions held to economically hedge/mitigate portfolio interest rate exposure (or duration) risk. We may elect to terminate certain swaps, caps and swaptions to align with our investment portfolio, agreements may mature or options may expire resulting in full settlement of our net interest spread asset/liability and the recognition of realized gains and losses, including early termination penalties. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps, caps and swaptions during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates. Since swaps, caps and swaptions are used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities.\n(Loss) Gain on Other Derivative Instruments\nThe following table provides a summary of the total (loss) gain recognized on other derivative instruments we hold for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, Markit IOS total return swaps, short U.S. treasuries, U.S. Treasury futures and inverse interest-only securities during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\n____________________\n (1) As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments. \nFor further details regarding our use of derivative instruments and related activity, refer to Note 7 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Income\nWe recorded other income of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and $0.3 million and $3.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease in other income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was driven by losses on extinguishment of debt and lower dividend income on our FHLB stock due to a decrease in the average balance held.\nExpenses\nThe following table presents the components of expenses, excluding nonrecurring transaction expenses, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\n____________________\n (1) Officers include our principal financial officer and general counsel. We do not reimburse PRCM Advisers for any expenses related to the compensation of our chief executive officer or chief investment officer. \n (2) Equity based compensation expense related to the amortization of restricted stock awarded to our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel. \nManagement fees are payable to PRCM Advisers, our external manager, under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. In connection with the acquisition of CYS effective July 31, 2018, the management agreement was amended to (i) reduce PRCM Advisers' base management fee with respect to the additional equity under management resulting from the merger to 0.75% from the effective time through the first anniversary of the effective time and (ii) for the fiscal quarter in which closing of the merger occurred, to make a one-time downward adjustment of Pine River's management fees payable by Two Harbors for such quarter by $15.0 million to offset the cash consideration payable to stockholders of CYS, plus an additional downward adjustment of up to $3.3 million for certain transaction-related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the total one-time downward adjustment to management fees was $17.5 million. Effective July 31, 2019, the management fee reduction on the equity acquired in the CYS transaction expired. We do not anticipate any further downward adjustments to management fees for transaction-related expenses.\nWe also incur servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of MSR and other operating expenses. The increase in servicing expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018, was largely the result of an increase in the size of our MSR portfolio. Included in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us, including compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our activities in accordance with the management agreement; we do not reimburse PRCM Advisers for any expenses related to the compensation of our chief executive officer or chief investment officer.\nWe have direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services, technology and certain office lease payments, but most of our expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nAcquisition Transaction Costs\nThe acquisition of CYS was treated as an asset purchase under U.S. GAAP. Given there were no meaningful nonfinancial assets and non-current assets acquired in the merger with CYS and no identified intangible assets to assign value, the excess consideration and costs associated with the transaction were recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as acquisition transaction costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these acquisition transaction costs totaled approximately $86.7 million.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn connection with the acquisition of CYS, we incurred restructuring charges, including termination benefits, contract terminations and other associated costs, of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of $2.4 million and $13.6 million, respectively, which was primarily due to losses recognized on MSR, offset by net gains recognized on derivative instruments held in the Company's TRSs. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our TRSs recognized a provision for income taxes of $6.7 million and $41.8 million, which was primarily due to realized gains on sales of AFS securities and gains recognized on MSR held in the TRSs as well as the write-down of net deferred tax assets resulting from the deemed liquidation of one of our TRSs due to its TRS election revocation, offset by net losses incurred on derivative instruments held in the TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nFinancial Condition\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value\nAgency RMBS\nOur Agency RMBS AFS portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS AFS were Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations that carry an implied rating of AAA,\u201d or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. government. The majority of these securities consist of whole pools in which we own all of the investment interests in the securities.\nThe tables below summarize certain characteristics of our Agency RMBS AFS at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\n\n____________________\n (1) Fixed Other represents weighted-average coupon interest-only securities that are not generally used for our interest-rate risk management purposes. These securities pay variable coupon interest based on the weighted average of the fixed rates of the underlying loans of the security, less the weighted average rates of the applicable issued P&I securities. \nOur three-month average constant prepayment rate, or CPR, experienced by Agency RMBS AFS owned by us as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, on an annualized basis, was 14.3% and 6.8%, respectively.\nNon-Agency Securities\nOur non-Agency securities portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine tranches of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. The following tables provide investment information on our non-Agency securities as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\n\nThe majority of our non-Agency securities were rated at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. These credit ratings are based on the par value of the non-Agency securities, whereas the distressed non-Agency securities in our portfolio were acquired at heavily discounted prices. The following table summarizes the credit ratings of our non-Agency securities portfolio, based on the Bloomberg Index Rating, a composite of each of the four major credit rating agencies (i.e., DBRS Ltd., Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Standard & Poor's Corporation and Fitch, Inc.), as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\nWithin our non-Agency securities portfolio, we have a substantial emphasis on legacy\u201d securities, which include securities issued up to and including 2009, many of which are subprime. We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve, as there remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays.\nDue to acquisitions of legacy\u201d non-Agency securities, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount increased from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 (as disclosed in Note 4 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). From December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount increased from 65.6% to 75.3%.\nA subprime bond may generally be considered higher risk; however, if purchased at a discount that reflects a high expectation of credit losses, it could be viewed as less risky than a prime bond, which is subject to unanticipated credit loss performance. Accordingly, we believe our risk profile in owning a heavily discounted subprime bond with known delinquencies affords us the ability to assume a higher percentage of expected credit loss with comparable risk-adjusted returns to a less discounted prime bond with a lower percentage of expected credit loss.\nThe following tables present certain information by investment type and, if applicable, their respective underlying loan characteristics for our senior and mezzanine non-Agency securities, excluding our non-Agency interest-only portfolio, at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\n\n____________________\n (1) Average purchase price utilized carrying value for weighting purposes. If current face were utilized for weighting purposes, the average purchase price for senior, mezzanine, and total non-Agency securities, excluding our non-Agency interest-only portfolio, would be $59.53, $60.13 and $59.60, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and $58.17, $64.90 and $59.59, respectively at December 31, 2018. \n (2) Average credit enhancement remaining on our non-Agency P&I securities portfolio, which is the average amount of protection available to absorb future credit losses due to defaults on the underlying collateral. \n (3) Three-month CPR is reflective of the prepayment speed on the underlying securitization; however, it does not necessarily indicate the proceeds received on our investment tranche. Proceeds received for each security are dependent on the position of the individual security within the structure of each deal. \n (4) Constant default rate, or CDR, represents the percentage of outstanding principal balances in the pool that are in default. \n (5) Severity rates reflect the amount of loss expected from a foreclosure and liquidation of the underlying collateral in the mortgage loan pool. \n (6) Represents the percentage of cumulative losses to date on the underlying loans. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe underlying mortgage loans collateralizing our non-Agency securities are located across the U.S. The following table presents the five largest geographic concentrations of the mortgages and assets collateralizing these securities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights, at Fair Value\nOne of our wholly owned subsidiaries has approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to own and manage MSR, which represent the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans. We do not directly service mortgage loans, and instead contract with appropriately licensed subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the loans underlying our MSR. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our MSR had a fair market value of $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our MSR portfolio included MSR on 793,470 and 717,167 loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $175.9 billion and $163.1 billion, respectively. The following tables summarize certain characteristics of the loans underlying our MSR by gross weighted average coupon rate types and ranges at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\n\nFinancing\nOur borrowings consist primarily of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities and term notes payable. These borrowings are collateralized by our pledge of AFS securities, derivative instruments, MSR and certain cash balances. Substantially all of our Agency RMBS are currently pledged as collateral, and the majority of our non-Agency securities have been pledged as collateral, either through repurchase agreements or FHLB advances.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we formed a new trust entity, or the Issuer Trust, for the purpose of financing MSR through securitization. On June 27, 2019, we, through the Issuer Trust, completed an MSR securitization transaction pursuant to which, through two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, MSR is pledged to the Issuer Trust and in return, the Issuer Trust issued (a) an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in term notes to qualified institutional buyers and (b) a variable funding note, or VFN, with a maximum principal balance of $1.0 billion to one of the subsidiaries, in each case secured on a pari passu basis. The term notes bear interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 2.80% per annum. The term notes will mature on June 25, 2024 or, if extended pursuant to the terms of the related indenture supplement, June 25, 2026 (unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms).\nAdditionally, on January 19, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% convertible senior notes due 2022. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $282.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The majority of these proceeds were used to help fund our MSR assets, which previously had largely been funded with cash.\nAt December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes had the following characteristics:\n\n\n____________________\n (1) Includes unsecured convertible senior notes paying interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of $287.5 million. \nAs of December 31, 2019, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 6.1:1.0. We believe the current degree of leverage within our portfolio helps ensure that we have access to unused borrowing capacity, thus supporting our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet.\nThe following table provides a summary of our borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes, our net TBA notional amounts and our debt-to-equity ratios for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\n\n____________________\n (1) Defined as total borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes, plus implied debt on net TBA notional, divided by total equity. \nEquity\nThe tables below provide details of our changes in stockholders' equity from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 as well as a reconciliation of comprehensive income and GAAP net income to non-GAAP measures.\n\n\n____________________\n (1) Core Earnings, including dollar roll income, is a non-U.S. GAAP measure that we define as comprehensive income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, excluding realized and unrealized gains and losses\u201d (impairment losses, realized and unrealized gains and losses on the aggregate portfolio, reserve expense for representation and warranty obligations on MSR and non-cash compensation expense related to restricted common stock). As defined, Core Earnings, including dollar roll income, includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments and servicing income, net of estimated amortization on MSR. Dollar roll income is the economic equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Core Earnings, including dollar roll income, provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing the Company's results of operations and helps facilitate comparisons to industry peers. \n (2) Beginning with the period ended June 30, 2019, the Company refined the MSR amortization method utilized in the calculation of Core Earnings, including dollar roll income. The new method includes an adjustment for any gain or loss on the capital used to purchase the MSR and allows Core Earnings to better reflect how the carry earned on MSR varies as a function of prepayment rates. \nU.S. GAAP to Estimated Taxable Income\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of our GAAP net income (loss) to our estimated taxable income (loss) split between our REIT and TRSs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\n\nThe permanent tax differences recorded in 2019 include dividends paid from the Company's TRSs to the REIT. Additionally, permanent tax differences recorded in both 2019 and 2018 include a recurring difference related to the intercompany sales of RMBS and a recurring difference in compensation expense related to restricted stock dividends. Temporary differences are principally timing differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting related to unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments, realized and unrealized gains and losses from MSR and accretion and amortization from Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018, there were both permanent and temporary tax differences resulting from the treatment of transaction costs and related expenses from the merger with CYS.\nChange in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities, do not impact our GAAP net (loss) income or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted for as trading instruments.\nDividends\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared cash dividends totaling $1.67 per share. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders, subject to certain distribution requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our board of directors elected to distribute the majority of our taxable income to avoid U.S. Federal Income taxes. As such, temporary differences between GAAP net income (loss) and taxable income can generate deterioration in book value on a permanent and temporary basis as taxable income is distributed that has not been earned for U.S. GAAP purposes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecasted on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could negatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls. We also believe that it gives us the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities and term notes payable to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\nOn March 21, 2019, we completed a public offering of 18,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.76 per share. On March 22, 2019, an additional 2,700,000 shares were sold to the underwriters of the offering pursuant to an overallotment option. The net proceeds were approximately $284.5 million, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $0.3 million.\nTo the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, MSR and other target assets and for other general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $558.1 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; $33.5 billion of AFS securities, MSR, and derivative assets held at fair value; and $30.3 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, increased from 5.3:10 to 6.1:1.0 and increased from 5.8:1.0 to 6.1:1.0, respectively. The increase was driven by increased financing on Agency RMBS purchases. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our economic debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, MSR and Agency Derivatives, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes and implied debt on net TBA notional, increased from 7.2:10 to 7.5:1.0 for both periods.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $1.3 million of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and $1.6 billion of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $354.6 million of unpledged MSR. Overall, we had unused borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities of $1.2 billion, which includes the repurchase facility pursuant to which the Company may finance the VFN issued in connection with the MSR securitization transaction completed on June 27, 2019. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided or the inability to meet lenders' eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity. If borrowing rates and/or collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more leveraged organization.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not experience any restrictions to our funding sources, although balance sheet capacity of counterparties have tightened due to compliance with the Basel III regulatory capital reform rules as well as management of perceived risk in the current interest rate environment. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable, convertible notes and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had master repurchase agreements in place with 47 counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate additional counterparties to manage and optimize counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional assets or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and counterparty geographical concentration at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\n____________________\n (1) Represents the net carrying value of the assets sold under agreements to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or assets on deposit to secure the repurchase obligation, less the amount of the repurchase liability, including accrued interest. \n (2) Exposure to European and Asian domiciled banks and their U.S. subsidiaries. \nIn addition to our master repurchase agreements to fund our Agency and non-Agency securities, we have two repurchase facilities and one revolving credit facility that provide short- and long-term financing for our MSR portfolio. An overview of the facilities is presented in the table below:\n\n____________________\n (1) The facilities are set to mature on the stated expiration date, unless extended pursuant to their terms. \n (2) Commitment fee charged on unused capacity. \n (3) This repurchase facility is secured by the VFN issued in connection with the MSR securitization transaction completed on June 27, 2019, which is collateralized by our MSR. \n (4) This repurchase facility is secured by MSR notes, which are collateralized by our MSR. \nOur wholly owned subsidiary, TH Insurance, is a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. As of December 31, 2019, TH Insurance had $210.0 million in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of 2.00%.\nThe ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. Each advance requires approval by the FHLB and is secured by collateral in accordance with the FHLB's credit and collateral guidelines, as may be revised from time to time by the FHLB. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, Agency RMBS and certain non-Agency securities with a rating of A and above.\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the final rule excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a membership grace period that runs through February 19, 2021, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited; however, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to 40% of its total assets.\nWe are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represent the most restrictive financial covenants across the agreements as of December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 Total indebtedness to tangible net worth must be less than 8.0:1.0. As of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness to tangible net worth, as defined, was 6.2:1.0. \n \u2022 Cash liquidity must be greater than $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, our liquidity, as defined, was $558.1 million. \n \u2022 Net worth must be greater than $1.5 billion or 50% of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior, whichever is higher. As of December 31, 2019, 50% of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior was $2.6 billion and our net worth, as defined, was $5.0 billion.  We are also subject to additional financial covenants in connection with various other agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business. We intend to continue to operate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants.\nThe following table summarizes assets at carrying values that were pledged or restricted as collateral for the future payment obligations of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and derivative instruments at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\n____________________\n (1) U.S. Treasuries received as collateral and re-pledged. \nAlthough we generally intend to hold our target assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of our assets in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. Our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities are generally actively traded and thus, in most circumstances, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including MSR, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as MSR may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain regulatory approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with regulatory requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our MSR, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises.\nIn addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities and term notes payable, a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources.\nThe following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our restricted and unrestricted cash balance increased approximately $519.1 million to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The cash movements can be summarized by the following:\n \u2022 Cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities increased our cash balances by approximately $1.1 billion, primarily driven by our financial results for the year. \n \u2022 Cash flows from investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, investing activities decreased our cash balances by approximately $6.1 billion, primarily driven by purchases of MSR and AFS securities. \n \u2022 Cash flows from financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, financing activities increased our cash balance by approximately $5.5 billion, primarily driven by increases in repurchase agreements as a result of purchases of AFS securities. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not participated in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities, convertible senior notes, interest expense on borrowings, our non-cancelable office leases, net of contractual subleases, and management fees payable under our management agreement:\n\n____________________\n (1) Interest expense on borrowings calculated based on rates at December 31, 2019. \n (2) Contractual obligation for the management fee is estimated through the contract expiration date of October 28, 2020, inclusive of the termination fee as defined in the management agreement between us and PRCM Advisers. Disclosure assumes the agreement is not renewed pursuant to its terms and that the effective termination date is October 28, 2020. \nWe are party to a management agreement with PRCM Advisers, pursuant to which PRCM Advisers is entitled to receive a management fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses from us. We reimburse PRCM Advisers for (i) our allocable share of the compensation paid by PRCM Advisers to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and personnel employed by PRCM Advisers as in-house legal, tax, accounting, consulting, auditing, administrative, information technology, valuation, computer programming and development and back-office resources to us, and (ii) any amounts for personnel of PRCM Advisers' affiliates arising under a shared facilities and services agreement. We also have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for data services and technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nWe are also party to contracts that contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with brokers, underwriters, counterparties to lending agreements and investors in the RMBS we issued in connection with our previous residential mortgage loan securitization transactions, the term notes we issued in connection with our MSR securitization and the loans\nunderlying our MSR. The maximum potential future payment amount we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nInflation\nSubstantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.\nOther Matters\nWe intend to conduct our business so as to maintain our exempt status under, and not to become regulated as, an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we failed to maintain our exempt status under the 1940 Act and became regulated as an investment company, our ability to, among other things, use leverage would be substantially reduced and, as a result, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in Item 1, Business - Other Business - Regulation\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, we monitor our compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Tests of the 1940 Act in order to maintain our exempt status. As of December 31, 2019, we determined that we maintained compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Test requirements.\nWe calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code for the year ended December 31, 2019. We also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the 75% source of income test and for the 95% source of income test rules for the year ended December 31, 2019. Consequently, we met the REIT income and asset tests. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income. Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nThe TCJA made many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to businesses, including REITs and TRSs. Pursuant to the TCJA, as of January 1, 2018, the federal income tax rate applicable to corporations was reduced to 21% and the corporate alternative minimum tax was repealed. In addition, the deduction of net interest expense is limited for all businesses; provided that certain businesses, including real estate businesses, may elect not to be subject to such limitations and instead to depreciate their real property related assets over longer depreciable lives. This limitation could adversely affect our TRSs.", "item_7_tables": "Table 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
