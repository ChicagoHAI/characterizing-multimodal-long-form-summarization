Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our \"Selected Financial Data\" and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are one of the world's leading global CROs, by revenue, providing outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We believe we are one of a select group of CROs with the expertise and capability to conduct clinical trials across major therapeutic areas on a global basis. Our therapeutic expertise includes areas that are among the largest in pharmaceutical development, and we focus in particular on oncology, central nervous system inflammation, respiratory, cardiometabolic and infectious diseases. We believe that we further differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our investments in medical informatics and clinical technologies designed to enhance efficiencies, improve study predictability and provide better transparency for our clients throughout their clinical development processes.\nContracts define the relationships with our clients and establish the way we earn revenue. Three types of relationships are most common: a fixed-price contract, a time and materials contract and fee-for-service arrangements. In cases where the contracts are fixed price, we may bear the cost of overruns for the contracted scope, or we may benefit if the costs are lower than we anticipated for the contracted scope. In cases where our contracts are fee-for-service, the contracts contain an overall budget for contracted resources. If actual resources used are lower than anticipated, the client generally keeps the savings and we may be responsible for covering the cost of the unused resource if we are unable to redeploy the resource. For time and material contracts, we bill the client only for the actual hours we spend to complete the contracted scope based upon stated hourly rates by position. The duration of our contracts range from a few months to several years. Revenue for services is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured. Once these criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for the services provided on fixed-fee contracts based on the proportional performance methodology, which determines the proportion of outputs or performance obligations which have been completed or delivered compared to the total contractual outputs for performance obligations. To measure performance, we compare the contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. As part of the client proposal and contract negotiation process, we develop a detailed project budget for the direct costs based on the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the geographical location involved and our historical experience. We then establish the individual contract pricing based on our internal pricing guidelines, discount agreements, if any, and negotiations with the client. The estimated total contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts, with adjustments to revenue resulting from such revisions being recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are first identified. Our costs consist of expenses necessary to carry out the clinical development project undertaken by us on behalf of the client. These costs primarily include the expense of obtaining appropriately qualified labor to administer the project, which we refer to as direct cost headcount. Other costs we incur are attributable to the expense of operating our business generally, such as leases and maintenance of information technology and equipment. Revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as hours are\nincurred. Revenues and the related costs of fee-for-service contracts are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn addition to our GAAP financial measures, we review various financial and operational metrics, including, new business awards, cancellations, and backlog. Many of our current contracts include clinical trials covering multiple geographic locations. We utilize the same management systems and reporting tools to monitor and manage these activities on the same basis worldwide. For this reason, we consider our operations to be a single business segment, and we present our results of operations as a single reportable segment.\nOur gross new business awards for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $1,927.6 million and $1,745.4 million, respectively. Our gross new business awards, excluding the RPS Acquisition, for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $997.7 million. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial and is documented by written or electronic correspondence or for our Strategic Solutions offering when the amount of revenue expected to be recognized is measurable. The number of new business awards can vary significantly from year to year, and awards can have terms ranging from several months to several years. For our Strategic Solutions offering, the value of a new business award is the anticipated service revenue to be recognized in the corresponding quarter of the next fiscal year. For the remainder of our business, the value of a new award is the anticipated service revenue over the life of the contract, which does not include reimbursement activity or investigator fees.\nIn the normal course of business, we experience contract cancellations, which are reflected as cancellations when the client provides us with written or electronic correspondence that the work should cease. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had $231.0 million, $251.7 million, and $223.3 million, respectively, of cancellations for which we received correspondence from the client. The number of cancellations can vary significantly from year to year. The value of the cancellation is the remaining amount of unrecognized service revenue, less the estimated effort to transition the work back to the client.\nOur backlog consists of anticipated service revenue from new business awards that either have not started or are in process but have not been completed. Backlog varies from period to period depending upon new business awards and contract modifications, cancellations, and the amount of service revenue recognized under existing contracts. Our backlog at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively.\nIndustry Trends\nISR estimated in its ISR 2016 Market Report that the size of the worldwide CRO market was approximately $28 billion in 2015 and will grow at a 7% CAGR to $38 billion over the next five years. This growth will be driven by an increase in the amount of research and development expenditures and higher levels of clinical development outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies.\nAcquisition of PRA by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P.\nEffective September 23, 2013, we were acquired by affiliates of KKR for $1.4 billion pursuant to a plan of merger by and among the Company, merger sub and Genstar, or Merger. Upon completion of the KKR Transaction, merger sub was merged with and into PRA Holdings, Inc., Predecessor Company, which became a subsidiary of Pinnacle Holdco Parent, Inc., or Parent. On December 19, 2013, Pinnacle Holdco Parent, Inc. changed its name to PRA Global Holdings, Inc. and on July 10, 2014, PRA Global Holdings, Inc. changed its name to PRA Health Sciences, Inc.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed a number of acquisitions in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas. On February 28, 2013, the Predecessor Company acquired all of the outstanding member's interest of ClinStar, LLC, or ClinStar, a contract research organization and logistics provider based in the United States with operations in Eastern Europe, for $45.0 million in cash and contingent consideration in the form of a potential earn-out payment of up to $5.0 million. On September 23, 2013, immediately following the Merger, and using proceeds from the borrowings issued on the same day, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of RPS Parent Holding Corp., or RPS, a global contract research organization based in the United States, for $289.3 million, subject to a working capital adjustment of up to $15.0 million. The acquisition of RPS provides the Company with a more diverse client mix, including 16 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. On December 2, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of CRI Holding Company, LLC, or CRI Lifetree, a specialized research organization, for $77.1 million in cash. CRI Lifetree focuses on the conduct and design of early stage, patient population studies, and is therapeutically focused in human abuse liability, addiction, pain, psychiatry, neurology, pediatric and infectious disease services. On June 8, 2015, the Company purchased the assets of Value Health Solutions Inc., or VHS, a software development firm, for $0.5 million in cash and 47,598 unregistered shares of the Company's common stock with a fair market value of $1.6 million; an additional $0.4 million of common stock will be issued in June 2017, less amounts reimbursable to the Company for any indemnification obligations of the seller. The asset purchase agreement also includes contingent consideration in the form of potential earn-out payments of up to $16.0 million. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included since the date of acquisition.\nSee Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to these acquisitions.\nJoint Ventures\nIn December 2012, we signed a joint venture agreement with WuXi to offer a broad platform of Phase I-IV clinical trial services in China, Hong Kong and Macau. The joint venture provides services including clinical trial monitoring, project management, regulatory strategy and submissions, data management, biostatistics, drug safety reporting, and medical monitoring. The clinical operations of WuXi and PRA in China were combined to operate as an independent contract research organization, WuXiPRA Clinical Research Co., Ltd, or WuxiPRA; the joint venture is jointly owned by PRA (49%) and WuXi (51%).\nWe contributed $4.6 million to the joint venture during March 2013, and during April 2015, we made an additional $3.0 million contribution to WuXiPRA, along with WuXi, to fund the joint venture's working capital needs. Our interests in WuXiPRA remains at 49% after the capital contribution. We recorded reductions to the investment balance of $2.9 million and $2.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, $0.7 million during the Successor period from September 23, 2013 to December 31, 2013 and $0.8 million during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2013 to September 22, 2013, respectively, for our equity in the venture's net loss for the period, which is recorded in the equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment will be adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting. The investment in WuXiPRA totaled $1.1 million and $1.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn December 4, 2015, we signed a framework agreement with WuXi to dissolve the WuXiPRA joint venture. Under the new arrangement, the portion of the joint venture located in mainland China will become a wholly owned subsidiary of WuXi, and the portion of the joint venture located in Hong Kong will become a wholly owned subsidiary of PRA. In addition, we will retain our Strategic Solutions\nbusiness in China and Hong Kong. We will form a preferred provider relationship with WuXi under which WuXi will provide full-service clinical trial services for global clinical trials subcontracted by us in China. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2016.\nIn March 2013, RPS entered into a joint venture agreement with A2 Healthcare Corporation (formerly part of Asklep, Inc.). The joint venture provides research and development outsourcing solutions in Japan to the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries. This joint venture is based in Tokyo, Japan and is owned by PRA (49%) and A2 Healthcare Corporation (51%). On October 17, 2014, the joint venture changed its name from RPS Asklep, Inc. to A2PRA Corporation, or A2PRA. There was no change in the investment balance during the year ended December 31, 2015. We recorded a $0.1 million reduction to the investment balance during the year ended December 31, 2014 and there was no change in the investment balance during the Successor 2013 Period, for our equity in the venture's net loss for the period, which is recorded in the equity in losses of unconsolidated joint venture, net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment will be adjusted for RPS's equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting. The investment in A2PRA totaled $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn August 2015, the Company and an affiliate of KKR entered into a joint venture. The joint venture was dissolved in December 2015. The purpose of the joint venture included, among other things, the evaluation of investments or acquisitions to enhance the strategic objectives of the Company. The joint venture was jointly owned by the Company (11%) and KKR (89%). The Company contributed $20.0 million to the joint venture in August 2015 and received $19.5 million when the joint venture was dissolved. The Company recorded the $0.5 million reduction to the investment balance in equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. The investment in the joint venture was adjusted for the Company's equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting.\nSources of Revenue\nTotal revenues are comprised of service revenue and reimbursement revenue, each of which is described below.\nService Revenue\nWe generally enter into contracts with customers to provide services with payments based on either fixed-fee, time and materials, or fee-for-service arrangements. Revenue for services is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nOnce these criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for the services provided on fixed-fee contracts based on the proportional performance methodology, which determines the proportion of outputs or performance obligations which have been completed or delivered compared to the total contractual outputs for performance obligations. To measure performance, we compare the contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. As part of the client proposal and contract negotiation process, we develop a detailed project budget for the direct costs based on the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the geographical location involved and our historical experience. We then establish the individual contract pricing based on our internal pricing guidelines, discount agreements, if any, and negotiations with the client. The estimated total contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts, with adjustments to revenue resulting from such revisions being recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are first identified. Revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as hours are incurred. Billable hours typically fluctuate during the terms of individual contracts, as services we provide\ngenerally increase at the beginning of a study and decrease toward the end of a study. Revenues and the related costs of fee-for-service contracts are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nA majority of our contracts undergo modifications over the contract period and our contracts provide for these modifications. During the modification process, we recognize revenue to the extent we incur costs, provided client acceptance and payment is deemed reasonably assured.\nWe often offer volume discounts to our large customers based on annual volume thresholds. We record an estimate of the annual volume rebate as a reduction of revenue throughout the period based on the estimated total rebate to be earned for the period.\nMost of our contracts can be terminated by the client either immediately or after a specified period, typically 30 to 60 days, following notice. In the case of early termination, these typically contracts require payment to us of fees earned to date, the fees, and in some cases, a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early. Based on ethical, regulatory, and health considerations, this wind-down activity may continue for several quarters or years. Therefore, revenue recognized prior to cancellation generally does not require a significant adjustment upon cancellation.\nIncreases in the estimated total direct costs to complete a contract without a corresponding proportional increase to the total contract price result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized in the period the change in estimate is determined.\nOur service revenue was $1,375.8 million and $1,266.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, $324.4 million for the period from September 23, 2013 to December 31, 2013, or the Successor 2013 Period, and $508.5 million for the period from January 1, 2013 to September 22, 2013, or the Predecessor 2013 Period. Changes in service revenue from period to period are driven primarily by changes in backlog at the beginning of a period, as well as new business awards during such period. Additionally, service revenue and billable hours will generally be impacted by the mix of studies that are active during a period, as different studies have different staffing requirements, as well as the life cycles of projects that are active during a period.\nOur service revenues are derived from a wide range of client types. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived 48% of our service revenue from large pharmaceutical companies, 15% of our service revenue from small- to mid-sized pharmaceutical companies, 22% of our service revenue from large biotechnology companies and 15% of our service revenue from emerging biotechnology companies. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our top five clients represented approximately 41%, 38%, and 30%, respectively, of service revenue; this revenue was derived from a combination of fixed-fee contracts, fee-for-service contracts and time and materials contracts. One client accounted for 10.7% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015. No individual project accounted for 10% or more of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. No client or individual project accounted for 10% or more of service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nReimbursement Revenue and Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Costs\nWe incur out-of-pocket costs, which are reimbursable by our customers. We include these out-of-pocket costs as reimbursement revenue and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.\nAs is customary in our industry, we also routinely enter into separate agreements on behalf of our clients with independent physician investigators in connection with clinical trials. We also receive funds from our clients for investigator fees, which are netted against the related costs, since such fees are the obligation of our clients, without risk or reward to us. We are not obligated either to perform the service or to pay the investigator in the event of default by the client. In addition, we do not pay the\nindependent physician investigator until funds are received from the client. Accordingly, unlike reimbursable out-of-pocket costs, we do not recognize these investigator fees in revenue.\nReimbursement costs and investigator fees are not included in our backlog because they are pass-through costs to our clients.\nWe believe that the fluctuations in reimbursement costs and reimbursement revenue from period to period are not meaningful to our underlying performance.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our direct costs, selling, general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. In addition, we incur reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses; however, as noted above, our reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses are directly offset by our reimbursement revenue. Since reimbursement revenue is offset by our out-of-pocket reimbursable expenses, we monitor and measure costs as a percentage of service revenue rather than total revenue as we believe this is a more meaningful comparison and better reflects the operations of our business.\nDirect Costs\nOur direct costs consist primarily of labor-related charges. They include elements such as salaries, benefits and incentive compensation for our employees. In addition, we utilize staffing agencies to procure primarily part time individuals to perform work on our contracts. Labor-related charges as a percentage of our total direct costs were 95.7% and 94.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 96.5% for the Successor 2013 Period and 93.3% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The cost of labor procured through staffing agencies is included in these percentages and represent 4.1% and 5.1% of total direct cost for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 2.1% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 3.4% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Our remaining direct costs are items such as travel, meals, postage and freight, patient costs, medical waste and supplies. The total of all these items as a percentage of total direct cost were 4.3% and 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 3.5% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 6.7% for the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nHistorically, direct costs have increased with an increase in service revenues. The future relationship between direct costs and service revenues may vary from historical relationships. Direct costs as a percentage of service revenues were 64.4% and 67.8% during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 68.7% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 59.8% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. On a forward looking basis, as a result of the acquisition of RPS which operates at a lower margin than we have historically experienced, we expect our direct costs as a percent of service revenue to be in the 65% to 70% range. Several factors will cause direct costs to decrease as a percentage of service revenues. Deployment of our billable staff in an optimally efficient manner has the most impact on our ratio of direct cost to service revenue. The most effective deployment of our staff is when they are fully engaged in billable work and are accomplishing contract related activities at a rate that meets or exceeds budgeted targets. We also seek to optimize our efficiency by performing work using the employee with the lowest cost. Generally, the following factors may cause direct costs to increase as a percentage of service revenues: our staff are not fully deployed, as is the case when there are unforeseen cancellations or delays, or when our staff are accomplishing tasks at levels of effort that exceed budget, such as rework; as well as pricing pressure from increased competition.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of administration payroll and benefits, marketing expenditures, and overhead costs such as information technology and facilities costs. These\nexpenses also include central overhead costs that are not directly attributable to our operating business and include certain costs related to insurance, professional fees and property.\nLoss on Modification or Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on modification of debt consists of debt financing costs that were expensed due to the modification of Predecessor and Successor debt as a result of debt amendments or debt repayments.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt consists of previously capitalized unamortized debt financing costs and prepayment penalty that were expensed as a result of the extinguishment of Predecessor debt as a result of the PRA Acquisition and Successor debt as a result of the repricing and the debt repayment in conjunction with our initial public offering, or IPO.\nTransaction-Related Costs\nTransaction-related costs consist of expenses incurred that relate directly to the KKR Transaction, the acquisition of RPS, and the acquisition of CRI Lifetree. These expenses include attorney, accounting, advisory fees, and transaction-related bonuses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation represents the depreciation charged on our fixed assets. The charge is recorded on a straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of three to seven years for computer hardware and software and five to seven years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the life of the lease term or the useful life of the improvements. Amortization expense consists of amortization recorded on acquisition-related intangible assets. Customer relationships, backlog and finite-lived trade names are amortized on an accelerated basis, which coincides with the period of economic benefit we expect to receive. All other finite-lived intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis. In accordance with GAAP, we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nBecause we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among several different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate can also vary based on changes in the tax rates of the different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by tax credits and the establishment or release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and tax reserves, as well as significant non-deductible items such as portions of transaction-related costs.\nForeign subsidiaries are taxed separately in their respective jurisdictions. We have foreign net operating loss carryforwards in some jurisdictions. The carryforward periods for these losses vary from five years to an indefinite carryforward period depending on the jurisdiction. Our ability to offset future taxable income with the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in certain instances, including changes in ownership.\nExchange Rate Fluctuations\nThe majority of our foreign operations transact in the Euro or Pound Sterling. As a result, our revenue and expenses are subject to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to these currencies. We have translated these currencies into U.S. Dollars using the following average exchange rates:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

$109.3 million, or 8.6%, from $1,266.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $1,375.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 benefited from an increase in billable hours and the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies, offset by an unfavorable impact of $45.4 million from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, and more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several years. The increase in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients.\nDirect costs increased by $27.3 million, or 3.2%, from $859.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $886.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in direct costs was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits of $104.3 million, as we continued to hire billable staff to support our current projects and as we hired additional staff in anticipation of our growing portfolio of studies, offset by an $8.3 million benefit due to the favorable\nimpact of the research and development credits, or R&D Credits, recorded in the current period that relate to prior tax years and a favorable impact of $64.2 million from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The R&D Credits are the result of a comprehensive analysis we have been performing across the organization to determine whether expenditures incurred qualify as research and development as defined by the respective jurisdiction. Direct costs as a percentage of service revenue decreased from 67.8% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 64.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is primarily due to the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of the R&D Credits.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $7.6 million, or 3.0%, from $254.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $246.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue decreased from 20.1% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 17.9% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to our continued ability to effectively manage our selling and administrative functions and a termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $18.6 million, or 19.3%, from $96.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $78.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue was 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 5.7% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue is primarily due the continued decline in amortization of our acquired intangibles, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $20.2 million from $81.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $61.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in interest expense is related to the paydowns to our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes made using proceeds from our IPO in November 2014 and repayments made to our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during 2015.\nLosses on modification or extinguishment of debt were $25.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and there were no losses on modification of debt during the year ended December 31, 2015. The $25.0 million loss on modification or extinguishment of debt incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a $1.4 million loss on modification debt as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and a $23.7 million loss on modification debt due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with our IPO.\nForeign currency gains, net increased by $3.5 million from $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The foreign currency gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, and gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment.\nProvisions for (benefit from) income taxes increased by $38.2 million from a benefit of $8.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to an income tax provision of $30.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate was 26.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015 and was a benefit rate of 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to fact that the Company was in an overall pre-tax income position for\nthe year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to an overall pre-tax loss for the year-ended December 31, 2014.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Predecessor 2013 Period\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

was $1,266.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $508.5 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from an increase in billable hours and an increase in the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, and the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several years. The increased levels of new business awards and backlog acquired in connection with our acquisitions had the effect of increasing our backlog by $734.2 million as of December 31, 2014 as compared to September 22, 2013. The increase in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients. The acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree resulted in $496.0 million of incremental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDirect costs were $859.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $304.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Direct costs were 67.8% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 59.8% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 8.0% increase in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is due to an increase in salaries and benefits as we continue to hire billable staff to support our current projects and as we hire additional staff in anticipation of our growing portfolio of studies. In addition, a significant portion of the increase in salaries and benefits relates to the acquisition of RPS, which typically requires higher staffing levels and which operates at a lower margin than we have historically experienced.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $142.9 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.1% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 28.1% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 8.0% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits as we realize synergies from our acquisitions, and our continued leverage of our selling and administrative functions, partially offset by the termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO. Additionally, the Predecessor 2013 Period included $23.6 million in stock-based compensation expense associated with the payment we made to holders of vested service-based stock options in connection with the February 2013 dividend to option holders and the accelerated vesting of unvested options related to the KKR Transaction in the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nThere were no transaction-related costs for year ended December 31, 2014 and transaction-related costs were $47.5 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The costs incurred in the Predecessor 2013 Period were attributable to the KKR Transaction and the acquisition of ClinStar.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $25.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Depreciation and amortization expense was 7.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 4.9% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to the increased amortization expense resulting from the KKR Transaction and the acquisitions of RPS and CRI Lifetree.\nInterest expense, net was $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $32.7 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Interest expense was 6.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 6.4% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 0.1% increase in interest expense as a percentage of service revenue was related to the additional debt incurred related to the September 2013 refinancing transactions.\nLosses on modification or extinguishment of debt were $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $21.7 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The loss on modification or extinguishment of debt of $25.0 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the loss on modification debt of $1.4 million as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and the loss on modification debt of $23.7 million due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written-off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with our IPO. The Predecessor 2013 Period amount is primarily attributable to the write-off of $15.2 million of previously recorded unamortized debt issuance costs and a prepayment penalty of $4.8 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period, which was due to the KKR Transaction.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net, were gains of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and losses of $3.6 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The foreign exchange gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and the settling and revaluation of accounts that are denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nBenefit from income taxes was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $22.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 31.5% in the Predecessor 2013 Period. The decrease in the effective tax rate of 12.0% was primarily attributable an increase in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Successor 2013 Period\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>December 31, 2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>September 23, 2013 -\nDecember 31, 2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,266,596 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>324,362 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reimbursement revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,854 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,459,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>379,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>859,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,776 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reimbursable out-of-pocket costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,854 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,730 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction-related costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,333 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on disposal of fixed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,657 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81,939 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,703 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,036 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,211 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency gains (losses), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,117 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,254 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,852 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(56,508 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,154 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,186 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,698 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,322 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,044 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(621 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(35,742 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(39,943 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService revenue was $1,266.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $324.4 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from an increase in billable hours and was offset in part by a decrease in the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, and the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The decrease in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients. In addition, a portion of the effective rate decrease is related to certain customers in our portfolio receiving more favorable pricing depending on the volume of business they contract with us. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several\nyears. The acquisition of CRI Lifetree resulted in $31.5 million of incremental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDirect costs were $859.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $222.8 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Direct costs were 67.8% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 68.7% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The 0.9% decrease in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits expense, which was driven by our continued focus on leveraging our billable staff and the continued integration of our acquisitions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $69.7 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.1% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 21.5% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The 1.4% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue was primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits as we realize synergies from our acquisitions and our continued leverage of our selling and administrative functions, partially offset by the termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO.\nThere were no transaction-related costs for year ended December 31, 2014 and transaction-related costs were $29.2 million during the Successor 2013 Period.

Depreciation and amortization expense 7.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 7.8% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The small decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the finalizing of our intangible asset valuations associated with the Merger and the RPS, ClinStar and CRI Lifetree acquisitions.\nInterest expense, net was $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $23.7 million for the Successor 2013 Period.

The loss on modification or extinguishment of debt of $25.0 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the loss on modification debt of $1.4 million as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and the loss on modification debt of $23.7 million due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written-off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with the IPO. The Successor 2013 Period amount represented a bank financing fee of $5.6 million on the bridge loan associated with the KKR Transaction that was not needed due to the successful completion of the offering of our Senior Notes and a loss of $1.6 million related to debt financing cost expensed as a result of the additional borrowings on December 2, 2013.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net, were gains of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and losses of $4.1 million for the Successor 2013 Period. The foreign exchange gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and the settling and revaluation of accounts that are denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nBenefit from income taxes was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $17.2 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014 and 30.3% in the Successor 2013 Period. The decrease in the effective tax rate of 10.8% were primarily attributable to an increase in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions.\nSeasonality\nAlthough our business is not generally seasonal, we typically experience a slight decrease in our revenue growth rate during the fourth quarter due to holiday vacations and a similar decrease in new business awards in the first quarter due to our clients' budgetary cycles and vacations during the year-end holiday period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $121.1 million of cash and cash equivalents of which $38.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for capital expenditures, expansion of services, geographic expansion, and other general corporate purposes. We have historically funded our operations and growth, including acquisitions, with cash flow from operations, borrowings, and issuances of equity securities. We expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and investments. We expect these activities will be funded from existing cash, cash flow from operations and, if necessary or appropriate, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities. Our sources of liquidity could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients, compliance with regulations, international risks, and personal injury, environmental or other material litigation claims.\nCash Collections\nCash collections from accounts receivable were $1,831.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, including $231.4 million of funds received from customers to pay independent physician investigators, or investigators, as compared to $1,654.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, including $248.2 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators, $475.3 million during the Successor 2013 Period, including $61.5 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators and $797.0 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period, including $150.4 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators. The increase in cash collections during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Successor 2013 Period and the Predecessor 2013 Period is related to our increase in revenue, driven by an increase in new business awards and backlog, and the acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree and improved cash payment schedules contained in our master service agreements and our statements of work.\nDiscussion of Cash Flows\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $130.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in operating cash flow reflects an increase in net income, a reduction in interest payments, as well as reduction in cash outflows from working capital. Interest payments decreased by $26.1 million, primarily due to the debt payments made in conjunction with the IPO during November 2014. Additionally, net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $14.3 million prepayment penalty on the Senior Notes and a $11.9 million fee paid to terminate our monitoring agreement with KKR. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, contributed to a $31.3 million improvement in cash flow from operations and reflects a slower rate of increase in our DSO in 2015 as compared to 2014. DSO can shift significantly at each reporting period depending on\nthe timing of cash receipts under contractual payment terms relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operations was $22.7 million compared to net cash used in operations of $23.9 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Cash provided by operating activities increased over the prior year as a result of an increase in our income from operations, primarily due to transaction-related costs incurred in connection with the KKR Transaction during the Successor 2013 Period. The increase was partially offset by increased net working capital, driven by an increase in our DSO, resulting from a change in customer composition after the acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operations was $22.7 million compared to net cash provided by operations of $49.2 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Cash provided by operating activities decreased over the prior year due to decreased cash flows from our net working capital, driven by outflows from accounts receivable and decreased inflows from accounts payable and other liabilities. The outflows from our accounts receivable is related to an increase in our DSO. The decreased inflows related to accounts payable and other liabilities is attributable a decrease in transaction-related expense associated with the KKR Transaction, which we had accrued for in the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $59.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in the cash outflows was due, in part, to a $32.9 million payment for the termination of our interest rate swaps during 2015. Cash flows relating to working capital adjustments associated with our recent acquisitions contributed to an additional $17.5 million of the change. A $5.5 million increase in fixed asset purchases during 2015, primarily related to our new bioanalytical laboratory in the Netherlands and the capitalized software costs for our new Predictivv platform, also contributed to the change.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1,019.0 million and $60.2 million for the Successor 2013 Period and the Predecessor 2013 Period, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we made $27.3 million in purchases of fixed assets offset by $15.9 million in collections of an acquisition-related receivable due from the former owners of RPS and CRI Lifetree. During the Successor 2013 Period, PRA Holdings was acquired for $667.4 million by KKR and acquired RPS Holdings, Inc. for $268.7 million. During the Predecessor 2013 Period, we acquired ClinStar for $40.8 million and made $14.8 million in purchases of fixed assets.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $42.4 million compared to $8.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the same period in 2014. During 2015, we voluntarily repaid $40.0 million on our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO and we repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.3 million compared to $1,115.0 million of net cash provided by financing activities during the Successor 2013 Period. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO. We repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt during the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $302.1 million was paid using proceeds from our IPO. In addition, we\nborrowed $105.0 million and repaid $115.0 million from our existing line of credit, which includes payments made on balances outstanding at December 31, 2013. During the Successor 2013 Period in connection with the KKR Transaction, the acquisition of RPS and the acquisition of CRI Lifetree, we borrowed funds under a new Senior Secured Credit Facility and issued Senior Notes, which resulted in $1,206.2 million of net borrowings. In addition, we repaid our then existing term loan and subordinated debt which resulted in a payment of $567.1 million. We also borrowed $50.0 million and repaid $40.0 million from our existing line of credit. In addition, we received $454.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of 38,782,463 shares of common stock in connection with the PRA Acquisition and $13.5 million from the issuance of 1,151,194 shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of CRI Lifetree. In addition, former members of CRI Lifetree's management contributed $2.1 million to purchase 179,075 shares of our common stock. Finally, former members of RPS's management converted $1.8 million of RPS stock options and equity into 155,288 shares of our common stock. This conversion was accounted for as a non-cash transaction in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.3 million compared to $37.3 million used in the Predecessor 2013 Period. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO. We repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt during the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $302.1 million was paid using proceeds from our IPO. In addition, we borrowed $105.0 million and repaid $115.0 million from our existing line of credit, which includes payments made on balances outstanding at December 31, 2013. During the Predecessor 2013 Period, we borrowed $93.2 million of incremental funds for the February 2013 acquisition of ClinStar and a payment of a dividend. The cash generated was offset by a $127.3 million use in the form of a dividend payment to our stockholders and the related payment to holders of vested service-based stock options in February 2013.\nIndebtedness\nIn September 2013, we entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities with a syndicate of banks led by UBS. We terminated our old credit facilities dated December 10, 2012. In September 2013, we also issued $375.0 million of our Senior Notes. The proceeds from our borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our issuance of the Senior Notes were used in conjunction with the acquisition by KKR, to fund the acquisition of RPS, repay existing debt, and pay for fees and expenses related to the aforementioned events. We paid $42.8 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes, which are recorded in deferred financing fees on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn September 2013, PRA Holdings signed a commitment letter with certain lenders for a senior secured one year bridge loan, or the bridge loan, to ensure financing would be available for the RPS Acquisition in the event that the offering of the Senior Notes was not closed by the date of closing of the RPS Acquisition. Due to the closing of the issuance of the Senior Notes, the bridge loan was terminated. At the closing of the issuance of the Senior Notes and the RPS Acquisition, a commitment fee of $5.6 million was paid to the lenders who provided the bridge loan commitment; this amount is included in the Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt line on the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn December 2, 2013, we borrowed an incremental $65.0 million under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of CRI Lifetree.\nOn March 24, 2014, we completed a repricing transaction associated with the first lien term loan that reduced the applicable margin from 4.0% to 3.5%. The repricing resulted in the write-off of $1.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs, which are included in loss on modification or extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn November 18, 2014, we repaid $152.1 million in principal on our Senior Notes and $150.0 million in principal on our Term Loan using proceeds from our IPO. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 470-50, Debt-modifications and Extinguishments, the debt repayment was accounted for as a partial debt extinguishment. The repayment resulted in a $14.3 million prepayment penalty on our Senior Notes, as well as the write-off of $9.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs, which are included in loss on modification or extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn February 18, 2016, we commenced an offer to purchase up to $75 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the cash tender offer.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nUBS Securities LLC, Jefferies Finance LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, KKR Capital Markets LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. act as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide senior secured financing of up to $1,015.0 million, consisting of:\n\u2022 the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $890.0 million; and\n\u2022 the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $125.0 million.\nThe borrower of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is PRA Holdings, Inc. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit up to $40.0 million and for up to $20.0 million of borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans.\nOn March 24, 2014, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement with UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as administrative agent, and other agents and lenders party thereto. Pursuant to this Amendment, among other terms contained therein, the principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was increased from $825.0 million to $890.0 million and all lenders agreed to exchange Initial Term Loans under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility for Tranche B-1 Loans with applicable margins of LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum. In addition, this Amendment established a 1.00% premium to prepayments to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility made on or prior to September 24, 2014.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provides that we have the right at any time to request incremental term loans and/or revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to (a) $185.0 million, plus (b) all voluntary prepayments and corresponding voluntary commitment reductions of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, other than from proceeds of refinancing indebtedness, prior to the date of any such incurrence, plus (c) an additional amount which, after giving effect to the incurrence of such amount, we would not exceed a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 4.5 to 1.0 pro forma for such incremental facilities, minus (d) the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of new term loan commitments and new revolving credit commitments incurred and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of certain other indebtedness incurred. The lenders under these facilities are not under any obligation to provide any such incremental commitments or loans, and any such addition of or increase in commitments or loans is subject to certain customary conditions precedent.\nInterest Rate and Fees\nBorrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) LIBOR for the relevant interest period, plus an applicable margin; provided that solely with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility LIBOR shall be deemed to be no less than 1.00% per annum or (b) a base rate, or the Base Rate, equal to the highest of (1) the rate of interest established by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in Stamford, Connecticut, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) LIBOR for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin; provided that solely with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility the Base Rate shall be deemed to be no less than 2.00% per annum.\nThe applicable margin for Base Rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 3.00% per annum, for LIBOR borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 4.00% per annum, for letter of credit loans under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 4.00% per annum, for Base Rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is 2.50% per annum, for LIBOR borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is 3.50% per annum. The applicable margins under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will decrease, based upon PRA Holdings' achievement of certain specified consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratios.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, PRA Holdings is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum to the lenders under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee rate will be reduced to 0.375% subject to our achieving a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.25 to 1.0 on a given date. We are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.\nPrepayments\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:\n\u2022 50% of our annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) commencing with the first full fiscal year of the borrower following the date of the closing of the PRA Acquisition and the RPS Acquisition (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if PRA Holdings achieves a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.0, but greater than 3.25 to 1.0 on the date of prepayment for the most recent test period and no prepayment will be required if PRA Holdings achieves a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.0 on the date of prepayment for the most recent test period);\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of insurance proceeds of proceeds of a condemnation award in respect of any casualty to any equipment, fixed assets or real property;\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of permitted sale leasebacks; and\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property in excess of $20.0 million and subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds within 450 days following receipt of the net cash proceeds of such disposition.\nThe foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied first to accrued interest and fees and second, to the scheduled installments of principal of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in direct order of maturity.\nWe may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty (other than as set forth in the immediately succeeding paragraph), subject to reimbursements of the lenders' redeployment costs actually incurred in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period.\nAmortization and Final Maturity\nThe Senior Secured Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, with the balance being payable on the date that is on or about September 23, 2020. Our voluntary prepayments made during 2014, using proceeds from the IPO, fully satisfy all required quarterly principal payments through maturity. Principal amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full at maturity, on or about September 23, 2018.\nGuarantee and Security\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by us and all our material, wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiaries, with customary exceptions including where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences.\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of the borrower and each guarantor, including but not limited to: (i) a perfected pledge of all of the capital stock issued by the borrower and each guarantor and (ii) perfected security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and the guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and exclusions).\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022 enter into sale-leaseback transactions\n\u2022 create or incur liens;\n\u2022 engage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022 sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022 restrict distributions to the borrower or restricted subsidiaries from their subsidiaries;\n\u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 pay certain dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022 make investments, loans or advances, prepayments of junior financings or other restricted payments; and\n\u2022 change the conduct of business.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain customary events of default (subject to exceptions, thresholds and grace periods), including, without limitation: (i) nonpayment of principal or interest; (ii) failure to perform or observe covenants; (iii) inaccuracy or breaches of representations and warranties; (iv) cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness; (v) certain bankruptcy related events;\n(vi) impairment of certain security interests in collateral, guarantees or invalidity or unenforceability of certain Senior Secured Credit Facility documents; (vii) monetary judgment defaults; (viii) certain ERISA matters; and (ix) certain change of control events.\nIn addition, the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 7.5 to 1.0 for any four consecutive fiscal quarters for which financial statements have been provided to the administrative agent as required by the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, when loans plus letters of credit under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (excluding (i) letters of credit existing on the date of the closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any extensions thereof, replacement letters of credit or letters of credit issued in lieu thereof, in each case, to the extent the face amount of such letters of credit is not increased above the face amount of the letter of credit being extended, replaced or substituted and (ii) other non-cash collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $15 million) are or would be outstanding in an amount exceeding 30.0% of the total facility amount under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control.\nSenior Notes\nPRA Holdings has $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.5% senior notes outstanding, which mature on October 1, 2023, pursuant to the indenture. Interest on the notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year.\nRedemption\nOn or prior to October 1, 2018, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nAfter October 1, 2018, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the range of prepayments premiums.\nChange of Control\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, which is defined in the indenture, each holder of the notes has the right to require PRA Holdings to repurchase some or all of such holder's notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\nCovenants\nThe indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, PRA Health Sciences' ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to (subject to certain exceptions):\n\u2022 incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022 pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem equity interests of the issuer, prepay or repurchase subordinated indebtedness, make certain investments;\n\u2022 sell or transfer certain assets;\n\u2022 create liens on certain assets to secure debt;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nEvents of Default\nThe indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the notes to become or to be declared due and payable, including without limitation: (i) nonpayment of principal or interest;

Interest payments are based on the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2015.\n(2)Service purchase commitments are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.\n(3)As of December 31, 2015, our liability related to uncertain income tax positions was approximately $11.7 million, of which $10.8 million has not been included in the above table as we are unable to predict when these liabilities will be paid due to the uncertainties in timing of the settlement of the income tax positions.\n(4)On May 5, 2014, we reached a settlement in the amount of $9.0 million related to a customer dispute. We paid $4.5 million and $1.5 million related to this dispute in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The remaining $3.0 million is payable in installments through December 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements. The term \"off-balance sheet arrangement\" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated\nwith us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our service revenue is recorded regionally on a proportional performance basis. Revenue for service is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. To measure performance, we compare contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. We believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contract obligations because the costs relate to the amount of labor hours incurred to perform the service. Direct costs are primarily comprised of labor-related charges associated with the delivery of services. Each month we accumulate costs on each project and compare them to the total current estimated costs to determine the proportional performance. We then multiply the proportion completed by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue that can be recognized. Each month we review the total current estimated costs on each project to determine if these estimates are still accurate and, if necessary, we adjust the total estimated costs for each project. During our monthly contract review process, we review each contract's performance to date, current cost trends, and circumstances specific to each study. The original or current cost estimates are reviewed and if necessary the estimates are adjusted and refined to reflect any changes in the anticipated performance under the study. In the normal course of business, we conduct this review each month in all service delivery locations. As the work progresses, original estimates might be deemed incorrect due to, among other things, revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate, and a contract modification might be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs. If not, we bear the risk of costs exceeding our original estimates. Management assumes that actual costs incurred to date under the contract are a valid basis for estimating future costs. Should management's assumption of future cost trends fluctuate significantly, future margins could be reduced. In the past, we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects, resulting in lower margins on those projects. Should our actual costs exceed our estimates on fixed price contracts, future margins could be reduced, absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification. We accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process. Historically, the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct, but these estimates might not continue to be accurate in the future.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIncluded in \"Accounts receivable and unbilled services, net\" on our consolidated balance sheets is an allowance for doubtful accounts. Generally, before we do business with a new client, we perform a\ncredit check, as our allowance for doubtful accounts requires that we make an accurate assessment of our customers' creditworthiness. Approximately 10-20% of our client base is emerging biotech companies, creating a heightened risk related to the creditworthiness for a portion of our client base. We manage and assess our exposure to bad debt on each of our contracts. We age our billed accounts receivable and assess exposure by client type, by aged category, and by specific identification. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Historically, we have not had any write-offs in excess of our allowance. If, at December 31, 2015, our aged accounts receivable balance greater than 90 days were to increase by 10% (for the U.S. operations), no material adjustments to bad debt expense would be required.\nIncome Taxes\nChanges in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of our effective tax rate and, consequently, our operating results. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nWe have to use estimates and judgments in calculating certain tax liabilities and determining the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating losses, tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. We are also required to reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In determining future taxable income, assumptions include the amount of state, federal and international pretax operating income, international transfer pricing policies, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. Based on our analysis of the above factors, we determined that a valuation allowance of $23.2 million was required as of December 31, 2015 relating the net U.S. net deferred tax asset, state net operating loss carryforwards, foreign net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards. Changes in our assumptions could result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance, up or down, in the future.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We determine our liability for uncertain tax positions globally under the provisions in Financial Accounting Standards Board's, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 740, Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2015, we had recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of $11.7 million. If events occur such that payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our calculation of the liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment, a tax expense or benefit to expense, respectively, would result. The total liability reversal that could affect the tax rate is $7.7 million.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with the FASB's ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, as modified and supplemented, we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes model for all options with a service condition or a Monte Carlo model for options with\nmarket and performance conditions. The determination of fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the stock price of similar entities as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected life. In developing our assumption, we take into account the following:\n\u2022 We use the historical volatilities of a selected peer group as we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common share price. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available. For the purpose of identifying peer companies, we consider characteristics such as industry, length of trading history, similar vesting terms and in-the-money option status. We plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common shares is relevant to measure expected volatility for future award grants.\n\u2022 The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options.\n\u2022 The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts.\n\u2022 For those options valued using the Black-Scholes model, the expected life is based upon the guidance provided by the FASB. For those options with a market condition valued under the Monte Carlo model, the expected life varies depending on the target stock price that triggers vesting.\n\u2022 As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our company experience. Current accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nDue to the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors with the assistance of management, based on a number of factors consistent with the methodologies outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of our common stock is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant as listed on the NASDAQ.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAs a result of our acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite-lived acquired intangibles. The identification and valuation of these intangible assets at the time of acquisition require significant management judgment and estimates.\nWe review long-lived asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group might not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. As a result of our acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite-lived acquired intangibles. The identification and valuation of these intangible assets at the time of acquisition require significant management judgment and estimates. In connection with the acquisition of PRA by KKR on September 23, 2013, the purchases of\nClinStar on February 28, 2013, RPS on September 23, 2013, CRI Lifetree on December 2, 2013, and VHS on June 8, 2015, valuations were completed, and value was assigned to identifiable finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, based on the purchase price of the transactions.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of our reporting units. On October 1, 2015, we reviewed goodwill for impairment and our analysis indicated that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, no impairment exists. This model utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the expected future in-flows and outflows of our business and an appropriate discount rate. We test indefinite lived intangible assets, principally trade names, on at least an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the trade name to our carrying value. On October 1, 2015, we reviewed our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and our analysis indicated a fair value in excess of book value. This model utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the expected future in-flows and outflows of our business and an appropriate discount rate. This process is inherently subjective and dependent upon the estimates and assumptions we make. In determining the expected future cash flows of our company, we assume that we will continue to enter into new contracts, execute the work on these contracts profitably, collect receivables from customers, and thus generate positive cash flows. In addition, our analysis could be impacted by future adverse change such as future declines in our operating results, a further significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry or failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecast.\nThe estimated fair value of the EDS reporting unit closely approximated its carrying value when we performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2014. We made operational improvements during 2015 in order to improve the profitability of the EDS reporting unit. As a result of these changes, EDS saw growth in both backlog and new business awards that contributed to its improved financial performance during the year and led to us updating its forecast for future periods. We considered all of these factors when it performed its most recent goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 and it was concluded that the estimated fair value of the EDS reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by $48.9 million or 23%. Any negative changes in assumptions on revenue, new business awards, cancellations, or our ability to improve operations while maintaining a competitive cost structure could adversely affect the fair value of EDS and result in significant goodwill impairment charges in 2016 or later.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value is further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we used Level 3 inputs to measure liabilities totaling $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The liability at December 31, 2015 relates to contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisition of VHS. The liability at December 31, 2014 related to contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisition of ClinStar. No other liabilities or assets are remeasured at fair value.\nInflation\nOur long-term contracts, those in excess of one year, generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date. As a result, we expect that inflation generally will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Historically our projection of inflation contained within our contracts has not significantly impacted our operating income. Should inflation be in excess of the estimates within our contracts our operating margins would be negatively impacted if we were unable to negotiate contract modifications with our clients.\nPotential Liability and Insurance\nOur clients provide us with contractual indemnification for all of our service related contracts. In addition, we attempt to manage our risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients from administration of products under study through measures such as stringent operating procedures and insurance. We monitor our clinical trials in a manner designed to ensure compliance with government regulations and guidelines. We have adopted global standard operating procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the United States and in many foreign countries that serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. We currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe are adequate and appropriate. If our insurance coverage is not adequate to cover actual claims, or if insurance coverage does not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially harmed. Historically we have experienced infrequent and immaterial claims. Should a material claim arise that exceeds our insurance coverage levels, there would be a dollar for dollar impact to operating income for the amount in excess of our insurance coverage.\nDividend History\nWe have not declared or paid dividends during 2015 and 2014. Dividends paid (including the related payments to holders of options) during the Successor 2013 Period totaled $4.3 million and dividends paid during the Predecessor 2013 Period totaled $127.3 million.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our \"Selected Financial Data\" and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are one of the world's leading global CROs, by revenue, providing outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We believe we are one of a select group of CROs with the expertise and capability to conduct clinical trials across major therapeutic areas on a global basis. Our therapeutic expertise includes areas that are among the largest in pharmaceutical development, and we focus in particular on oncology, central nervous system inflammation, respiratory, cardiometabolic and infectious diseases. We believe that we further differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our investments in medical informatics and clinical technologies designed to enhance efficiencies, improve study predictability and provide better transparency for our clients throughout their clinical development processes.\nContracts define the relationships with our clients and establish the way we earn revenue. Three types of relationships are most common: a fixed-price contract, a time and materials contract and fee-for-service arrangements. In cases where the contracts are fixed price, we may bear the cost of overruns for the contracted scope, or we may benefit if the costs are lower than we anticipated for the contracted scope. In cases where our contracts are fee-for-service, the contracts contain an overall budget for contracted resources. If actual resources used are lower than anticipated, the client generally keeps the savings and we may be responsible for covering the cost of the unused resource if we are unable to redeploy the resource. For time and material contracts, we bill the client only for the actual hours we spend to complete the contracted scope based upon stated hourly rates by position. The duration of our contracts range from a few months to several years. Revenue for services is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured. Once these criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for the services provided on fixed-fee contracts based on the proportional performance methodology, which determines the proportion of outputs or performance obligations which have been completed or delivered compared to the total contractual outputs for performance obligations. To measure performance, we compare the contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. As part of the client proposal and contract negotiation process, we develop a detailed project budget for the direct costs based on the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the geographical location involved and our historical experience. We then establish the individual contract pricing based on our internal pricing guidelines, discount agreements, if any, and negotiations with the client. The estimated total contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts, with adjustments to revenue resulting from such revisions being recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are first identified. Our costs consist of expenses necessary to carry out the clinical development project undertaken by us on behalf of the client. These costs primarily include the expense of obtaining appropriately qualified labor to administer the project, which we refer to as direct cost headcount. Other costs we incur are attributable to the expense of operating our business generally, such as leases and maintenance of information technology and equipment. Revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as hours are\nincurred. Revenues and the related costs of fee-for-service contracts are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn addition to our GAAP financial measures, we review various financial and operational metrics, including, new business awards, cancellations, and backlog. Many of our current contracts include clinical trials covering multiple geographic locations. We utilize the same management systems and reporting tools to monitor and manage these activities on the same basis worldwide. For this reason, we consider our operations to be a single business segment, and we present our results of operations as a single reportable segment.\nOur gross new business awards for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $1,927.6 million and $1,745.4 million, respectively. Our gross new business awards, excluding the RPS Acquisition, for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $997.7 million. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial and is documented by written or electronic correspondence or for our Strategic Solutions offering when the amount of revenue expected to be recognized is measurable. The number of new business awards can vary significantly from year to year, and awards can have terms ranging from several months to several years. For our Strategic Solutions offering, the value of a new business award is the anticipated service revenue to be recognized in the corresponding quarter of the next fiscal year. For the remainder of our business, the value of a new award is the anticipated service revenue over the life of the contract, which does not include reimbursement activity or investigator fees.\nIn the normal course of business, we experience contract cancellations, which are reflected as cancellations when the client provides us with written or electronic correspondence that the work should cease. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had $231.0 million, $251.7 million, and $223.3 million, respectively, of cancellations for which we received correspondence from the client. The number of cancellations can vary significantly from year to year. The value of the cancellation is the remaining amount of unrecognized service revenue, less the estimated effort to transition the work back to the client.\nOur backlog consists of anticipated service revenue from new business awards that either have not started or are in process but have not been completed. Backlog varies from period to period depending upon new business awards and contract modifications, cancellations, and the amount of service revenue recognized under existing contracts. Our backlog at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively.\nIndustry Trends\nISR estimated in its ISR 2016 Market Report that the size of the worldwide CRO market was approximately $28 billion in 2015 and will grow at a 7% CAGR to $38 billion over the next five years. This growth will be driven by an increase in the amount of research and development expenditures and higher levels of clinical development outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies.\nAcquisition of PRA by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P.\nEffective September 23, 2013, we were acquired by affiliates of KKR for $1.4 billion pursuant to a plan of merger by and among the Company, merger sub and Genstar, or Merger. Upon completion of the KKR Transaction, merger sub was merged with and into PRA Holdings, Inc., Predecessor Company, which became a subsidiary of Pinnacle Holdco Parent, Inc., or Parent. On December 19, 2013, Pinnacle Holdco Parent, Inc. changed its name to PRA Global Holdings, Inc. and on July 10, 2014, PRA Global Holdings, Inc. changed its name to PRA Health Sciences, Inc.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed a number of acquisitions in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas. On February 28, 2013, the Predecessor Company acquired all of the outstanding member's interest of ClinStar, LLC, or ClinStar, a contract research organization and logistics provider based in the United States with operations in Eastern Europe, for $45.0 million in cash and contingent consideration in the form of a potential earn-out payment of up to $5.0 million. On September 23, 2013, immediately following the Merger, and using proceeds from the borrowings issued on the same day, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of RPS Parent Holding Corp., or RPS, a global contract research organization based in the United States, for $289.3 million, subject to a working capital adjustment of up to $15.0 million. The acquisition of RPS provides the Company with a more diverse client mix, including 16 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. On December 2, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of CRI Holding Company, LLC, or CRI Lifetree, a specialized research organization, for $77.1 million in cash. CRI Lifetree focuses on the conduct and design of early stage, patient population studies, and is therapeutically focused in human abuse liability, addiction, pain, psychiatry, neurology, pediatric and infectious disease services. On June 8, 2015, the Company purchased the assets of Value Health Solutions Inc., or VHS, a software development firm, for $0.5 million in cash and 47,598 unregistered shares of the Company's common stock with a fair market value of $1.6 million; an additional $0.4 million of common stock will be issued in June 2017, less amounts reimbursable to the Company for any indemnification obligations of the seller. The asset purchase agreement also includes contingent consideration in the form of potential earn-out payments of up to $16.0 million. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included since the date of acquisition.\nSee Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to these acquisitions.\nJoint Ventures\nIn December 2012, we signed a joint venture agreement with WuXi to offer a broad platform of Phase I-IV clinical trial services in China, Hong Kong and Macau. The joint venture provides services including clinical trial monitoring, project management, regulatory strategy and submissions, data management, biostatistics, drug safety reporting, and medical monitoring. The clinical operations of WuXi and PRA in China were combined to operate as an independent contract research organization, WuXiPRA Clinical Research Co., Ltd, or WuxiPRA; the joint venture is jointly owned by PRA (49%) and WuXi (51%).\nWe contributed $4.6 million to the joint venture during March 2013, and during April 2015, we made an additional $3.0 million contribution to WuXiPRA, along with WuXi, to fund the joint venture's working capital needs. Our interests in WuXiPRA remains at 49% after the capital contribution. We recorded reductions to the investment balance of $2.9 million and $2.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, $0.7 million during the Successor period from September 23, 2013 to December 31, 2013 and $0.8 million during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2013 to September 22, 2013, respectively, for our equity in the venture's net loss for the period, which is recorded in the equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment will be adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting. The investment in WuXiPRA totaled $1.1 million and $1.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn December 4, 2015, we signed a framework agreement with WuXi to dissolve the WuXiPRA joint venture. Under the new arrangement, the portion of the joint venture located in mainland China will become a wholly owned subsidiary of WuXi, and the portion of the joint venture located in Hong Kong will become a wholly owned subsidiary of PRA. In addition, we will retain our Strategic Solutions\nbusiness in China and Hong Kong. We will form a preferred provider relationship with WuXi under which WuXi will provide full-service clinical trial services for global clinical trials subcontracted by us in China. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2016.\nIn March 2013, RPS entered into a joint venture agreement with A2 Healthcare Corporation (formerly part of Asklep, Inc.). The joint venture provides research and development outsourcing solutions in Japan to the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries. This joint venture is based in Tokyo, Japan and is owned by PRA (49%) and A2 Healthcare Corporation (51%). On October 17, 2014, the joint venture changed its name from RPS Asklep, Inc. to A2PRA Corporation, or A2PRA. There was no change in the investment balance during the year ended December 31, 2015. We recorded a $0.1 million reduction to the investment balance during the year ended December 31, 2014 and there was no change in the investment balance during the Successor 2013 Period, for our equity in the venture's net loss for the period, which is recorded in the equity in losses of unconsolidated joint venture, net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment will be adjusted for RPS's equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting. The investment in A2PRA totaled $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn August 2015, the Company and an affiliate of KKR entered into a joint venture. The joint venture was dissolved in December 2015. The purpose of the joint venture included, among other things, the evaluation of investments or acquisitions to enhance the strategic objectives of the Company. The joint venture was jointly owned by the Company (11%) and KKR (89%). The Company contributed $20.0 million to the joint venture in August 2015 and received $19.5 million when the joint venture was dissolved. The Company recorded the $0.5 million reduction to the investment balance in equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. The investment in the joint venture was adjusted for the Company's equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting.\nSources of Revenue\nTotal revenues are comprised of service revenue and reimbursement revenue, each of which is described below.\nService Revenue\nWe generally enter into contracts with customers to provide services with payments based on either fixed-fee, time and materials, or fee-for-service arrangements. Revenue for services is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nOnce these criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for the services provided on fixed-fee contracts based on the proportional performance methodology, which determines the proportion of outputs or performance obligations which have been completed or delivered compared to the total contractual outputs for performance obligations. To measure performance, we compare the contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. As part of the client proposal and contract negotiation process, we develop a detailed project budget for the direct costs based on the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the geographical location involved and our historical experience. We then establish the individual contract pricing based on our internal pricing guidelines, discount agreements, if any, and negotiations with the client. The estimated total contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts, with adjustments to revenue resulting from such revisions being recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are first identified. Revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as hours are incurred. Billable hours typically fluctuate during the terms of individual contracts, as services we provide\ngenerally increase at the beginning of a study and decrease toward the end of a study. Revenues and the related costs of fee-for-service contracts are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nA majority of our contracts undergo modifications over the contract period and our contracts provide for these modifications. During the modification process, we recognize revenue to the extent we incur costs, provided client acceptance and payment is deemed reasonably assured.\nWe often offer volume discounts to our large customers based on annual volume thresholds. We record an estimate of the annual volume rebate as a reduction of revenue throughout the period based on the estimated total rebate to be earned for the period.\nMost of our contracts can be terminated by the client either immediately or after a specified period, typically 30 to 60 days, following notice. In the case of early termination, these typically contracts require payment to us of fees earned to date, the fees, and in some cases, a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early. Based on ethical, regulatory, and health considerations, this wind-down activity may continue for several quarters or years. Therefore, revenue recognized prior to cancellation generally does not require a significant adjustment upon cancellation.\nIncreases in the estimated total direct costs to complete a contract without a corresponding proportional increase to the total contract price result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized in the period the change in estimate is determined.\nOur service revenue was $1,375.8 million and $1,266.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, $324.4 million for the period from September 23, 2013 to December 31, 2013, or the Successor 2013 Period, and $508.5 million for the period from January 1, 2013 to September 22, 2013, or the Predecessor 2013 Period. Changes in service revenue from period to period are driven primarily by changes in backlog at the beginning of a period, as well as new business awards during such period. Additionally, service revenue and billable hours will generally be impacted by the mix of studies that are active during a period, as different studies have different staffing requirements, as well as the life cycles of projects that are active during a period.\nOur service revenues are derived from a wide range of client types. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived 48% of our service revenue from large pharmaceutical companies, 15% of our service revenue from small- to mid-sized pharmaceutical companies, 22% of our service revenue from large biotechnology companies and 15% of our service revenue from emerging biotechnology companies. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our top five clients represented approximately 41%, 38%, and 30%, respectively, of service revenue; this revenue was derived from a combination of fixed-fee contracts, fee-for-service contracts and time and materials contracts. One client accounted for 10.7% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015. No individual project accounted for 10% or more of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. No client or individual project accounted for 10% or more of service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nReimbursement Revenue and Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Costs\nWe incur out-of-pocket costs, which are reimbursable by our customers. We include these out-of-pocket costs as reimbursement revenue and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.\nAs is customary in our industry, we also routinely enter into separate agreements on behalf of our clients with independent physician investigators in connection with clinical trials. We also receive funds from our clients for investigator fees, which are netted against the related costs, since such fees are the obligation of our clients, without risk or reward to us. We are not obligated either to perform the service or to pay the investigator in the event of default by the client. In addition, we do not pay the\nindependent physician investigator until funds are received from the client. Accordingly, unlike reimbursable out-of-pocket costs, we do not recognize these investigator fees in revenue.\nReimbursement costs and investigator fees are not included in our backlog because they are pass-through costs to our clients.\nWe believe that the fluctuations in reimbursement costs and reimbursement revenue from period to period are not meaningful to our underlying performance.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our direct costs, selling, general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. In addition, we incur reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses; however, as noted above, our reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses are directly offset by our reimbursement revenue. Since reimbursement revenue is offset by our out-of-pocket reimbursable expenses, we monitor and measure costs as a percentage of service revenue rather than total revenue as we believe this is a more meaningful comparison and better reflects the operations of our business.\nDirect Costs\nOur direct costs consist primarily of labor-related charges. They include elements such as salaries, benefits and incentive compensation for our employees. In addition, we utilize staffing agencies to procure primarily part time individuals to perform work on our contracts. Labor-related charges as a percentage of our total direct costs were 95.7% and 94.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 96.5% for the Successor 2013 Period and 93.3% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The cost of labor procured through staffing agencies is included in these percentages and represent 4.1% and 5.1% of total direct cost for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 2.1% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 3.4% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Our remaining direct costs are items such as travel, meals, postage and freight, patient costs, medical waste and supplies. The total of all these items as a percentage of total direct cost were 4.3% and 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 3.5% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 6.7% for the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nHistorically, direct costs have increased with an increase in service revenues. The future relationship between direct costs and service revenues may vary from historical relationships. Direct costs as a percentage of service revenues were 64.4% and 67.8% during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 68.7% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 59.8% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. On a forward looking basis, as a result of the acquisition of RPS which operates at a lower margin than we have historically experienced, we expect our direct costs as a percent of service revenue to be in the 65% to 70% range. Several factors will cause direct costs to decrease as a percentage of service revenues. Deployment of our billable staff in an optimally efficient manner has the most impact on our ratio of direct cost to service revenue. The most effective deployment of our staff is when they are fully engaged in billable work and are accomplishing contract related activities at a rate that meets or exceeds budgeted targets. We also seek to optimize our efficiency by performing work using the employee with the lowest cost. Generally, the following factors may cause direct costs to increase as a percentage of service revenues: our staff are not fully deployed, as is the case when there are unforeseen cancellations or delays, or when our staff are accomplishing tasks at levels of effort that exceed budget, such as rework; as well as pricing pressure from increased competition.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of administration payroll and benefits, marketing expenditures, and overhead costs such as information technology and facilities costs. These\nexpenses also include central overhead costs that are not directly attributable to our operating business and include certain costs related to insurance, professional fees and property.\nLoss on Modification or Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on modification of debt consists of debt financing costs that were expensed due to the modification of Predecessor and Successor debt as a result of debt amendments or debt repayments.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt consists of previously capitalized unamortized debt financing costs and prepayment penalty that were expensed as a result of the extinguishment of Predecessor debt as a result of the PRA Acquisition and Successor debt as a result of the repricing and the debt repayment in conjunction with our initial public offering, or IPO.\nTransaction-Related Costs\nTransaction-related costs consist of expenses incurred that relate directly to the KKR Transaction, the acquisition of RPS, and the acquisition of CRI Lifetree. These expenses include attorney, accounting, advisory fees, and transaction-related bonuses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation represents the depreciation charged on our fixed assets. The charge is recorded on a straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of three to seven years for computer hardware and software and five to seven years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the life of the lease term or the useful life of the improvements. Amortization expense consists of amortization recorded on acquisition-related intangible assets. Customer relationships, backlog and finite-lived trade names are amortized on an accelerated basis, which coincides with the period of economic benefit we expect to receive. All other finite-lived intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis. In accordance with GAAP, we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nBecause we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among several different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate can also vary based on changes in the tax rates of the different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by tax credits and the establishment or release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and tax reserves, as well as significant non-deductible items such as portions of transaction-related costs.\nForeign subsidiaries are taxed separately in their respective jurisdictions. We have foreign net operating loss carryforwards in some jurisdictions. The carryforward periods for these losses vary from five years to an indefinite carryforward period depending on the jurisdiction. Our ability to offset future taxable income with the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in certain instances, including changes in ownership.\nExchange Rate Fluctuations\nThe majority of our foreign operations transact in the Euro or Pound Sterling. As a result, our revenue and expenses are subject to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to these currencies. We have translated these currencies into U.S. Dollars using the following average exchange rates:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

$109.3 million, or 8.6%, from $1,266.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $1,375.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 benefited from an increase in billable hours and the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies, offset by an unfavorable impact of $45.4 million from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, and more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several years. The increase in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients.\nDirect costs increased by $27.3 million, or 3.2%, from $859.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $886.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in direct costs was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits of $104.3 million, as we continued to hire billable staff to support our current projects and as we hired additional staff in anticipation of our growing portfolio of studies, offset by an $8.3 million benefit due to the favorable\nimpact of the research and development credits, or R&D Credits, recorded in the current period that relate to prior tax years and a favorable impact of $64.2 million from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The R&D Credits are the result of a comprehensive analysis we have been performing across the organization to determine whether expenditures incurred qualify as research and development as defined by the respective jurisdiction. Direct costs as a percentage of service revenue decreased from 67.8% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 64.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is primarily due to the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of the R&D Credits.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $7.6 million, or 3.0%, from $254.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $246.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue decreased from 20.1% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 17.9% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to our continued ability to effectively manage our selling and administrative functions and a termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $18.6 million, or 19.3%, from $96.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $78.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue was 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 5.7% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue is primarily due the continued decline in amortization of our acquired intangibles, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $20.2 million from $81.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $61.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in interest expense is related to the paydowns to our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes made using proceeds from our IPO in November 2014 and repayments made to our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during 2015.\nLosses on modification or extinguishment of debt were $25.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and there were no losses on modification of debt during the year ended December 31, 2015. The $25.0 million loss on modification or extinguishment of debt incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a $1.4 million loss on modification debt as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and a $23.7 million loss on modification debt due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with our IPO.\nForeign currency gains, net increased by $3.5 million from $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The foreign currency gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, and gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment.\nProvisions for (benefit from) income taxes increased by $38.2 million from a benefit of $8.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to an income tax provision of $30.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate was 26.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015 and was a benefit rate of 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to fact that the Company was in an overall pre-tax income position for\nthe year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to an overall pre-tax loss for the year-ended December 31, 2014.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Predecessor 2013 Period\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

was $1,266.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $508.5 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from an increase in billable hours and an increase in the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, and the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several years. The increased levels of new business awards and backlog acquired in connection with our acquisitions had the effect of increasing our backlog by $734.2 million as of December 31, 2014 as compared to September 22, 2013. The increase in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients. The acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree resulted in $496.0 million of incremental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDirect costs were $859.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $304.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Direct costs were 67.8% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 59.8% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 8.0% increase in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is due to an increase in salaries and benefits as we continue to hire billable staff to support our current projects and as we hire additional staff in anticipation of our growing portfolio of studies. In addition, a significant portion of the increase in salaries and benefits relates to the acquisition of RPS, which typically requires higher staffing levels and which operates at a lower margin than we have historically experienced.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $142.9 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.1% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 28.1% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 8.0% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits as we realize synergies from our acquisitions, and our continued leverage of our selling and administrative functions, partially offset by the termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO. Additionally, the Predecessor 2013 Period included $23.6 million in stock-based compensation expense associated with the payment we made to holders of vested service-based stock options in connection with the February 2013 dividend to option holders and the accelerated vesting of unvested options related to the KKR Transaction in the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nThere were no transaction-related costs for year ended December 31, 2014 and transaction-related costs were $47.5 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The costs incurred in the Predecessor 2013 Period were attributable to the KKR Transaction and the acquisition of ClinStar.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $25.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Depreciation and amortization expense was 7.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 4.9% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to the increased amortization expense resulting from the KKR Transaction and the acquisitions of RPS and CRI Lifetree.\nInterest expense, net was $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $32.7 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Interest expense was 6.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 6.4% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 0.1% increase in interest expense as a percentage of service revenue was related to the additional debt incurred related to the September 2013 refinancing transactions.\nLosses on modification or extinguishment of debt were $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $21.7 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The loss on modification or extinguishment of debt of $25.0 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the loss on modification debt of $1.4 million as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and the loss on modification debt of $23.7 million due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written-off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with our IPO. The Predecessor 2013 Period amount is primarily attributable to the write-off of $15.2 million of previously recorded unamortized debt issuance costs and a prepayment penalty of $4.8 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period, which was due to the KKR Transaction.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net, were gains of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and losses of $3.6 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The foreign exchange gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and the settling and revaluation of accounts that are denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nBenefit from income taxes was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $22.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 31.5% in the Predecessor 2013 Period. The decrease in the effective tax rate of 12.0% was primarily attributable an increase in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Successor 2013 Period\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>December 31, 2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>September 23, 2013 -\nDecember 31, 2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,266,596 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>324,362 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reimbursement revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,854 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,459,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>379,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>859,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,776 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reimbursable out-of-pocket costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,854 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,730 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction-related costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,333 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on disposal of fixed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,657 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81,939 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,703 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,036 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,211 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency gains (losses), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,117 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,254 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,852 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(56,508 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,154 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,186 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,698 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,322 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,044 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(621 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(35,742 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(39,943 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService revenue was $1,266.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $324.4 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from an increase in billable hours and was offset in part by a decrease in the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, and the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The decrease in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients. In addition, a portion of the effective rate decrease is related to certain customers in our portfolio receiving more favorable pricing depending on the volume of business they contract with us. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several\nyears. The acquisition of CRI Lifetree resulted in $31.5 million of incremental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDirect costs were $859.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $222.8 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Direct costs were 67.8% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 68.7% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The 0.9% decrease in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits expense, which was driven by our continued focus on leveraging our billable staff and the continued integration of our acquisitions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $69.7 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.1% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 21.5% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The 1.4% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue was primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits as we realize synergies from our acquisitions and our continued leverage of our selling and administrative functions, partially offset by the termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO.\nThere were no transaction-related costs for year ended December 31, 2014 and transaction-related costs were $29.2 million during the Successor 2013 Period. The costs incurred in the Successor 2013 Period were attributable to the KKR Transaction and the acquisition of CRI Lifetree.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $25.3 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Depreciation and amortization expense 7.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 7.8% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The small decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the finalizing of our intangible asset valuations associated with the Merger and the RPS, ClinStar and CRI Lifetree acquisitions.\nInterest expense, net was $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $23.7 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Interest expense was 6.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 7.3% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The 0.8% decrease in interest expense as a percentage of total revenue was primarily related to the March 2014 repricing and the repayment of debt following our IPO.\nLosses on modification or extinguishment of debt were $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $7.2 million for the Successor 2013 Period. The loss on modification or extinguishment of debt of $25.0 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the loss on modification debt of $1.4 million as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and the loss on modification debt of $23.7 million due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written-off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with the IPO. The Successor 2013 Period amount represented a bank financing fee of $5.6 million on the bridge loan associated with the KKR Transaction that was not needed due to the successful completion of the offering of our Senior Notes and a loss of $1.6 million related to debt financing cost expensed as a result of the additional borrowings on December 2, 2013.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net, were gains of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and losses of $4.1 million for the Successor 2013 Period. The foreign exchange gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and the settling and revaluation of accounts that are denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nBenefit from income taxes was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $17.2 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014 and 30.3% in the Successor 2013 Period. The decrease in the effective tax rate of 10.8% were primarily attributable to an increase in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions.\nSeasonality\nAlthough our business is not generally seasonal, we typically experience a slight decrease in our revenue growth rate during the fourth quarter due to holiday vacations and a similar decrease in new business awards in the first quarter due to our clients' budgetary cycles and vacations during the year-end holiday period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $121.1 million of cash and cash equivalents of which $38.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for capital expenditures, expansion of services, geographic expansion, and other general corporate purposes. We have historically funded our operations and growth, including acquisitions, with cash flow from operations, borrowings, and issuances of equity securities. We expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and investments. We expect these activities will be funded from existing cash, cash flow from operations and, if necessary or appropriate, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities. Our sources of liquidity could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients, compliance with regulations, international risks, and personal injury, environmental or other material litigation claims.\nCash Collections\nCash collections from accounts receivable were $1,831.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, including $231.4 million of funds received from customers to pay independent physician investigators, or investigators, as compared to $1,654.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, including $248.2 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators, $475.3 million during the Successor 2013 Period, including $61.5 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators and $797.0 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period, including $150.4 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators. The increase in cash collections during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Successor 2013 Period and the Predecessor 2013 Period is related to our increase in revenue, driven by an increase in new business awards and backlog, and the acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree and improved cash payment schedules contained in our master service agreements and our statements of work.\nDiscussion of Cash Flows\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $130.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in operating cash flow reflects an increase in net income, a reduction in interest payments, as well as reduction in cash outflows from working capital. Interest payments decreased by $26.1 million, primarily due to the debt payments made in conjunction with the IPO during November 2014. Additionally, net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $14.3 million prepayment penalty on the Senior Notes and a $11.9 million fee paid to terminate our monitoring agreement with KKR. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, contributed to a $31.3 million improvement in cash flow from operations and reflects a slower rate of increase in our DSO in 2015 as compared to 2014. DSO can shift significantly at each reporting period depending on\nthe timing of cash receipts under contractual payment terms relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operations was $22.7 million compared to net cash used in operations of $23.9 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Cash provided by operating activities increased over the prior year as a result of an increase in our income from operations, primarily due to transaction-related costs incurred in connection with the KKR Transaction during the Successor 2013 Period. The increase was partially offset by increased net working capital, driven by an increase in our DSO, resulting from a change in customer composition after the acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operations was $22.7 million compared to net cash provided by operations of $49.2 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Cash provided by operating activities decreased over the prior year due to decreased cash flows from our net working capital, driven by outflows from accounts receivable and decreased inflows from accounts payable and other liabilities. The outflows from our accounts receivable is related to an increase in our DSO. The decreased inflows related to accounts payable and other liabilities is attributable a decrease in transaction-related expense associated with the KKR Transaction, which we had accrued for in the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $59.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in the cash outflows was due, in part, to a $32.9 million payment for the termination of our interest rate swaps during 2015. Cash flows relating to working capital adjustments associated with our recent acquisitions contributed to an additional $17.5 million of the change. A $5.5 million increase in fixed asset purchases during 2015, primarily related to our new bioanalytical laboratory in the Netherlands and the capitalized software costs for our new Predictivv platform, also contributed to the change.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1,019.0 million and $60.2 million for the Successor 2013 Period and the Predecessor 2013 Period, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we made $27.3 million in purchases of fixed assets offset by $15.9 million in collections of an acquisition-related receivable due from the former owners of RPS and CRI Lifetree. During the Successor 2013 Period, PRA Holdings was acquired for $667.4 million by KKR and acquired RPS Holdings, Inc. for $268.7 million. During the Predecessor 2013 Period, we acquired ClinStar for $40.8 million and made $14.8 million in purchases of fixed assets.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $42.4 million compared to $8.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the same period in 2014. During 2015, we voluntarily repaid $40.0 million on our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO and we repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.3 million compared to $1,115.0 million of net cash provided by financing activities during the Successor 2013 Period. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO. We repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt during the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $302.1 million was paid using proceeds from our IPO. In addition, we\nborrowed $105.0 million and repaid $115.0 million from our existing line of credit, which includes payments made on balances outstanding at December 31, 2013. During the Successor 2013 Period in connection with the KKR Transaction, the acquisition of RPS and the acquisition of CRI Lifetree, we borrowed funds under a new Senior Secured Credit Facility and issued Senior Notes, which resulted in $1,206.2 million of net borrowings. In addition, we repaid our then existing term loan and subordinated debt which resulted in a payment of $567.1 million. We also borrowed $50.0 million and repaid $40.0 million from our existing line of credit. In addition, we received $454.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of 38,782,463 shares of common stock in connection with the PRA Acquisition and $13.5 million from the issuance of 1,151,194 shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of CRI Lifetree. In addition, former members of CRI Lifetree's management contributed $2.1 million to purchase 179,075 shares of our common stock. Finally, former members of RPS's management converted $1.8 million of RPS stock options and equity into 155,288 shares of our common stock. This conversion was accounted for as a non-cash transaction in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.3 million compared to $37.3 million used in the Predecessor 2013 Period. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO. We repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt during the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $302.1 million was paid using proceeds from our IPO. In addition, we borrowed $105.0 million and repaid $115.0 million from our existing line of credit, which includes payments made on balances outstanding at December 31, 2013. During the Predecessor 2013 Period, we borrowed $93.2 million of incremental funds for the February 2013 acquisition of ClinStar and a payment of a dividend. The cash generated was offset by a $127.3 million use in the form of a dividend payment to our stockholders and the related payment to holders of vested service-based stock options in February 2013.\nIndebtedness\nIn September 2013, we entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities with a syndicate of banks led by UBS. We terminated our old credit facilities dated December 10, 2012. In September 2013, we also issued $375.0 million of our Senior Notes. The proceeds from our borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our issuance of the Senior Notes were used in conjunction with the acquisition by KKR, to fund the acquisition of RPS, repay existing debt, and pay for fees and expenses related to the aforementioned events. We paid $42.8 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes, which are recorded in deferred financing fees on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn September 2013, PRA Holdings signed a commitment letter with certain lenders for a senior secured one year bridge loan, or the bridge loan, to ensure financing would be available for the RPS Acquisition in the event that the offering of the Senior Notes was not closed by the date of closing of the RPS Acquisition. Due to the closing of the issuance of the Senior Notes, the bridge loan was terminated. At the closing of the issuance of the Senior Notes and the RPS Acquisition, a commitment fee of $5.6 million was paid to the lenders who provided the bridge loan commitment; this amount is included in the Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt line on the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn December 2, 2013, we borrowed an incremental $65.0 million under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of CRI Lifetree.\nOn March 24, 2014, we completed a repricing transaction associated with the first lien term loan that reduced the applicable margin from 4.0% to 3.5%. The repricing resulted in the write-off of $1.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs, which are included in loss on modification or extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn November 18, 2014, we repaid $152.1 million in principal on our Senior Notes and $150.0 million in principal on our Term Loan using proceeds from our IPO. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 470-50, Debt-modifications and Extinguishments, the debt repayment was accounted for as a partial debt extinguishment. The repayment resulted in a $14.3 million prepayment penalty on our Senior Notes, as well as the write-off of $9.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs, which are included in loss on modification or extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn February 18, 2016, we commenced an offer to purchase up to $75 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the cash tender offer.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nUBS Securities LLC, Jefferies Finance LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, KKR Capital Markets LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. act as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide senior secured financing of up to $1,015.0 million, consisting of:\n\u2022 the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $890.0 million; and\n\u2022 the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $125.0 million.\nThe borrower of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is PRA Holdings, Inc. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit up to $40.0 million and for up to $20.0 million of borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans.\nOn March 24, 2014, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement with UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as administrative agent, and other agents and lenders party thereto. Pursuant to this Amendment, among other terms contained therein, the principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was increased from $825.0 million to $890.0 million and all lenders agreed to exchange Initial Term Loans under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility for Tranche B-1 Loans with applicable margins of LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum. In addition, this Amendment established a 1.00% premium to prepayments to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility made on or prior to September 24, 2014.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provides that we have the right at any time to request incremental term loans and/or revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to (a) $185.0 million, plus (b) all voluntary prepayments and corresponding voluntary commitment reductions of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, other than from proceeds of refinancing indebtedness, prior to the date of any such incurrence, plus (c) an additional amount which, after giving effect to the incurrence of such amount, we would not exceed a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 4.5 to 1.0 pro forma for such incremental facilities, minus (d) the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of new term loan commitments and new revolving credit commitments incurred and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of certain other indebtedness incurred. The lenders under these facilities are not under any obligation to provide any such incremental commitments or loans, and any such addition of or increase in commitments or loans is subject to certain customary conditions precedent.\nInterest Rate and Fees\nBorrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) LIBOR for the relevant interest period, plus an applicable margin; provided that solely with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility LIBOR shall be deemed to be no less than 1.00% per annum or (b) a base rate, or the Base Rate, equal to the highest of (1) the rate of interest established by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in Stamford, Connecticut, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) LIBOR for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin; provided that solely with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility the Base Rate shall be deemed to be no less than 2.00% per annum.\nThe applicable margin for Base Rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 3.00% per annum, for LIBOR borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 4.00% per annum, for letter of credit loans under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 4.00% per annum, for Base Rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is 2.50% per annum, for LIBOR borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is 3.50% per annum. The applicable margins under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will decrease, based upon PRA Holdings' achievement of certain specified consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratios.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, PRA Holdings is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum to the lenders under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee rate will be reduced to 0.375% subject to our achieving a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.25 to 1.0 on a given date. We are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.\nPrepayments\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:\n\u2022 50% of our annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) commencing with the first full fiscal year of the borrower following the date of the closing of the PRA Acquisition and the RPS Acquisition (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if PRA Holdings achieves a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.0, but greater than 3.25 to 1.0 on the date of prepayment for the most recent test period and no prepayment will be required if PRA Holdings achieves a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.0 on the date of prepayment for the most recent test period);\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of insurance proceeds of proceeds of a condemnation award in respect of any casualty to any equipment, fixed assets or real property;\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of permitted sale leasebacks; and\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property in excess of $20.0 million and subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds within 450 days following receipt of the net cash proceeds of such disposition.\nThe foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied first to accrued interest and fees and second, to the scheduled installments of principal of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in direct order of maturity.\nWe may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty (other than as set forth in the immediately succeeding paragraph), subject to reimbursements of the lenders' redeployment costs actually incurred in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period.\nAmortization and Final Maturity\nThe Senior Secured Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, with the balance being payable on the date that is on or about September 23, 2020. Our voluntary prepayments made during 2014, using proceeds from the IPO, fully satisfy all required quarterly principal payments through maturity. Principal amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full at maturity, on or about September 23, 2018.\nGuarantee and Security\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by us and all our material, wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiaries, with customary exceptions including where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences.\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of the borrower and each guarantor, including but not limited to: (i) a perfected pledge of all of the capital stock issued by the borrower and each guarantor and (ii) perfected security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and the guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and exclusions).\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022 enter into sale-leaseback transactions\n\u2022 create or incur liens;\n\u2022 engage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022 sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022 restrict distributions to the borrower or restricted subsidiaries from their subsidiaries;\n\u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 pay certain dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022 make investments, loans or advances, prepayments of junior financings or other restricted payments; and\n\u2022 change the conduct of business.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain customary events of default (subject to exceptions, thresholds and grace periods), including, without limitation: (i) nonpayment of principal or interest; (ii) failure to perform or observe covenants; (iii) inaccuracy or breaches of representations and warranties; (iv) cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness; (v) certain bankruptcy related events;\n(vi) impairment of certain security interests in collateral, guarantees or invalidity or unenforceability of certain Senior Secured Credit Facility documents; (vii) monetary judgment defaults; (viii) certain ERISA matters; and (ix) certain change of control events.\nIn addition, the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 7.5 to 1.0 for any four consecutive fiscal quarters for which financial statements have been provided to the administrative agent as required by the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, when loans plus letters of credit under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (excluding (i) letters of credit existing on the date of the closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any extensions thereof, replacement letters of credit or letters of credit issued in lieu thereof, in each case, to the extent the face amount of such letters of credit is not increased above the face amount of the letter of credit being extended, replaced or substituted and (ii) other non-cash collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $15 million) are or would be outstanding in an amount exceeding 30.0% of the total facility amount under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control.\nSenior Notes\nPRA Holdings has $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.5% senior notes outstanding, which mature on October 1, 2023, pursuant to the indenture. Interest on the notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year.\nRedemption\nOn or prior to October 1, 2018, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nAfter October 1, 2018, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the range of prepayments premiums.\nChange of Control\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, which is defined in the indenture, each holder of the notes has the right to require PRA Holdings to repurchase some or all of such holder's notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\nCovenants\nThe indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, PRA Health Sciences' ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to (subject to certain exceptions):\n\u2022 incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022 pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem equity interests of the issuer, prepay or repurchase subordinated indebtedness, make certain investments;\n\u2022 sell or transfer certain assets;\n\u2022 create liens on certain assets to secure debt;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nEvents of Default\nThe indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the notes to become or to be declared due and payable, including without limitation: (i) nonpayment of principal or interest; (ii) failure to perform or observe covenants; (iii) cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness; (iv) certain bankruptcy related events; (v) impairment of certain security interests in collateral, guarantees or invalidity or unenforceability of certain Senior Secured Credit Facility documents; and (vi) monetary judgment defaults.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our future minimum payments for all contractual obligations and commercial commitments for years subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payments on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>689,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>225,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>914,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>314,222 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service purchase commitments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: sublease income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(377 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(474 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(226 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(150 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,227 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncertain income tax positions(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>900 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer dispute settlement(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>103,981 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>168,782 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>833,048 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>404,374 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,510,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Principal payments are based on the terms contained in our credit agreement. Interest payments are based on the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2015.\n(2)Service purchase commitments are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.\n(3)As of December 31, 2015, our liability related to uncertain income tax positions was approximately $11.7 million, of which $10.8 million has not been included in the above table as we are unable to predict when these liabilities will be paid due to the uncertainties in timing of the settlement of the income tax positions.\n(4)On May 5, 2014, we reached a settlement in the amount of $9.0 million related to a customer dispute. We paid $4.5 million and $1.5 million related to this dispute in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The remaining $3.0 million is payable in installments through December 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements. The term \"off-balance sheet arrangement\" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated\nwith us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our service revenue is recorded regionally on a proportional performance basis. Revenue for service is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. To measure performance, we compare contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. We believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contract obligations because the costs relate to the amount of labor hours incurred to perform the service. Direct costs are primarily comprised of labor-related charges associated with the delivery of services. Each month we accumulate costs on each project and compare them to the total current estimated costs to determine the proportional performance. We then multiply the proportion completed by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue that can be recognized. Each month we review the total current estimated costs on each project to determine if these estimates are still accurate and, if necessary, we adjust the total estimated costs for each project. During our monthly contract review process, we review each contract's performance to date, current cost trends, and circumstances specific to each study. The original or current cost estimates are reviewed and if necessary the estimates are adjusted and refined to reflect any changes in the anticipated performance under the study. In the normal course of business, we conduct this review each month in all service delivery locations. As the work progresses, original estimates might be deemed incorrect due to, among other things, revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate, and a contract modification might be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs. If not, we bear the risk of costs exceeding our original estimates. Management assumes that actual costs incurred to date under the contract are a valid basis for estimating future costs. Should management's assumption of future cost trends fluctuate significantly, future margins could be reduced. In the past, we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects, resulting in lower margins on those projects. Should our actual costs exceed our estimates on fixed price contracts, future margins could be reduced, absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification. We accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process. Historically, the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct, but these estimates might not continue to be accurate in the future.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIncluded in \"Accounts receivable and unbilled services, net\" on our consolidated balance sheets is an allowance for doubtful accounts. Generally, before we do business with a new client, we perform a\ncredit check, as our allowance for doubtful accounts requires that we make an accurate assessment of our customers' creditworthiness. Approximately 10-20% of our client base is emerging biotech companies, creating a heightened risk related to the creditworthiness for a portion of our client base. We manage and assess our exposure to bad debt on each of our contracts. We age our billed accounts receivable and assess exposure by client type, by aged category, and by specific identification. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Historically, we have not had any write-offs in excess of our allowance. If, at December 31, 2015, our aged accounts receivable balance greater than 90 days were to increase by 10% (for the U.S. operations), no material adjustments to bad debt expense would be required.\nIncome Taxes\nChanges in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of our effective tax rate and, consequently, our operating results. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nWe have to use estimates and judgments in calculating certain tax liabilities and determining the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating losses, tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. We are also required to reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In determining future taxable income, assumptions include the amount of state, federal and international pretax operating income, international transfer pricing policies, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. Based on our analysis of the above factors, we determined that a valuation allowance of $23.2 million was required as of December 31, 2015 relating the net U.S. net deferred tax asset, state net operating loss carryforwards, foreign net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards. Changes in our assumptions could result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance, up or down, in the future.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We determine our liability for uncertain tax positions globally under the provisions in Financial Accounting Standards Board's, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 740, Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2015, we had recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of $11.7 million. If events occur such that payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our calculation of the liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment, a tax expense or benefit to expense, respectively, would result. The total liability reversal that could affect the tax rate is $7.7 million.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with the FASB's ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, as modified and supplemented, we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes model for all options with a service condition or a Monte Carlo model for options with\nmarket and performance conditions. The determination of fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the stock price of similar entities as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected life. In developing our assumption, we take into account the following:\n\u2022 We use the historical volatilities of a selected peer group as we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common share price. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available. For the purpose of identifying peer companies, we consider characteristics such as industry, length of trading history, similar vesting terms and in-the-money option status. We plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common shares is relevant to measure expected volatility for future award grants.\n\u2022 The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options.\n\u2022 The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts.\n\u2022 For those options valued using the Black-Scholes model, the expected life is based upon the guidance provided by the FASB. For those options with a market condition valued under the Monte Carlo model, the expected life varies depending on the target stock price that triggers vesting.\n\u2022 As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our company experience. Current accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nDue to the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors with the assistance of management, based on a number of factors consistent with the methodologies outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of our common stock is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant as listed on the NASDAQ.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAs a result of our acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite-lived acquired intangibles. The identification and valuation of these intangible assets at the time of acquisition require significant management judgment and estimates.\nWe review long-lived asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group might not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. As a result of our acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite-lived acquired intangibles. The identification and valuation of these intangible assets at the time of acquisition require significant management judgment and estimates. In connection with the acquisition of PRA by KKR on September 23, 2013, the purchases of\nClinStar on February 28, 2013, RPS on September 23, 2013, CRI Lifetree on December 2, 2013, and VHS on June 8, 2015, valuations were completed, and value was assigned to identifiable finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, based on the purchase price of the transactions.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of our reporting units. On October 1, 2015, we reviewed goodwill for impairment and our analysis indicated that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, no impairment exists. This model utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the expected future in-flows and outflows of our business and an appropriate discount rate. We test indefinite lived intangible assets, principally trade names, on at least an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the trade name to our carrying value. On October 1, 2015, we reviewed our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and our analysis indicated a fair value in excess of book value. This model utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the expected future in-flows and outflows of our business and an appropriate discount rate. This process is inherently subjective and dependent upon the estimates and assumptions we make. In determining the expected future cash flows of our company, we assume that we will continue to enter into new contracts, execute the work on these contracts profitably, collect receivables from customers, and thus generate positive cash flows. In addition, our analysis could be impacted by future adverse change such as future declines in our operating results, a further significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry or failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecast.\nThe estimated fair value of the EDS reporting unit closely approximated its carrying value when we performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2014. We made operational improvements during 2015 in order to improve the profitability of the EDS reporting unit. As a result of these changes, EDS saw growth in both backlog and new business awards that contributed to its improved financial performance during the year and led to us updating its forecast for future periods. We considered all of these factors when it performed its most recent goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 and it was concluded that the estimated fair value of the EDS reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by $48.9 million or 23%. Any negative changes in assumptions on revenue, new business awards, cancellations, or our ability to improve operations while maintaining a competitive cost structure could adversely affect the fair value of EDS and result in significant goodwill impairment charges in 2016 or later.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value is further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we used Level 3 inputs to measure liabilities totaling $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The liability at December 31, 2015 relates to contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisition of VHS. The liability at December 31, 2014 related to contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisition of ClinStar. No other liabilities or assets are remeasured at fair value.\nInflation\nOur long-term contracts, those in excess of one year, generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date. As a result, we expect that inflation generally will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Historically our projection of inflation contained within our contracts has not significantly impacted our operating income. Should inflation be in excess of the estimates within our contracts our operating margins would be negatively impacted if we were unable to negotiate contract modifications with our clients.\nPotential Liability and Insurance\nOur clients provide us with contractual indemnification for all of our service related contracts. In addition, we attempt to manage our risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients from administration of products under study through measures such as stringent operating procedures and insurance. We monitor our clinical trials in a manner designed to ensure compliance with government regulations and guidelines. We have adopted global standard operating procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the United States and in many foreign countries that serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. We currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe are adequate and appropriate. If our insurance coverage is not adequate to cover actual claims, or if insurance coverage does not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially harmed. Historically we have experienced infrequent and immaterial claims. Should a material claim arise that exceeds our insurance coverage levels, there would be a dollar for dollar impact to operating income for the amount in excess of our insurance coverage.\nDividend History\nWe have not declared or paid dividends during 2015 and 2014. Dividends paid (including the related payments to holders of options) during the Successor 2013 Period totaled $4.3 million and dividends paid during the Predecessor 2013 Period totaled $127.3 million.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our \"Selected Financial Data\" and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are one of the world's leading global CROs, by revenue, providing outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We believe we are one of a select group of CROs with the expertise and capability to conduct clinical trials across major therapeutic areas on a global basis. Our therapeutic expertise includes areas that are among the largest in pharmaceutical development, and we focus in particular on oncology, central nervous system inflammation, respiratory, cardiometabolic and infectious diseases. We believe that we further differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our investments in medical informatics and clinical technologies designed to enhance efficiencies, improve study predictability and provide better transparency for our clients throughout their clinical development processes.\nContracts define the relationships with our clients and establish the way we earn revenue. Three types of relationships are most common: a fixed-price contract, a time and materials contract and fee-for-service arrangements. In cases where the contracts are fixed price, we may bear the cost of overruns for the contracted scope, or we may benefit if the costs are lower than we anticipated for the contracted scope. In cases where our contracts are fee-for-service, the contracts contain an overall budget for contracted resources. If actual resources used are lower than anticipated, the client generally keeps the savings and we may be responsible for covering the cost of the unused resource if we are unable to redeploy the resource. For time and material contracts, we bill the client only for the actual hours we spend to complete the contracted scope based upon stated hourly rates by position. The duration of our contracts range from a few months to several years. Revenue for services is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured. Once these criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for the services provided on fixed-fee contracts based on the proportional performance methodology, which determines the proportion of outputs or performance obligations which have been completed or delivered compared to the total contractual outputs for performance obligations. To measure performance, we compare the contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. As part of the client proposal and contract negotiation process, we develop a detailed project budget for the direct costs based on the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the geographical location involved and our historical experience. We then establish the individual contract pricing based on our internal pricing guidelines, discount agreements, if any, and negotiations with the client. The estimated total contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts, with adjustments to revenue resulting from such revisions being recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are first identified. Our costs consist of expenses necessary to carry out the clinical development project undertaken by us on behalf of the client. These costs primarily include the expense of obtaining appropriately qualified labor to administer the project, which we refer to as direct cost headcount. Other costs we incur are attributable to the expense of operating our business generally, such as leases and maintenance of information technology and equipment. Revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as hours are\nincurred. Revenues and the related costs of fee-for-service contracts are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn addition to our GAAP financial measures, we review various financial and operational metrics, including, new business awards, cancellations, and backlog. Many of our current contracts include clinical trials covering multiple geographic locations. We utilize the same management systems and reporting tools to monitor and manage these activities on the same basis worldwide. For this reason, we consider our operations to be a single business segment, and we present our results of operations as a single reportable segment.\nOur gross new business awards for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $1,927.6 million and $1,745.4 million, respectively. Our gross new business awards, excluding the RPS Acquisition, for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $997.7 million. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial and is documented by written or electronic correspondence or for our Strategic Solutions offering when the amount of revenue expected to be recognized is measurable. The number of new business awards can vary significantly from year to year, and awards can have terms ranging from several months to several years. For our Strategic Solutions offering, the value of a new business award is the anticipated service revenue to be recognized in the corresponding quarter of the next fiscal year. For the remainder of our business, the value of a new award is the anticipated service revenue over the life of the contract, which does not include reimbursement activity or investigator fees.\nIn the normal course of business, we experience contract cancellations, which are reflected as cancellations when the client provides us with written or electronic correspondence that the work should cease. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had $231.0 million, $251.7 million, and $223.3 million, respectively, of cancellations for which we received correspondence from the client. The number of cancellations can vary significantly from year to year. The value of the cancellation is the remaining amount of unrecognized service revenue, less the estimated effort to transition the work back to the client.\nOur backlog consists of anticipated service revenue from new business awards that either have not started or are in process but have not been completed. Backlog varies from period to period depending upon new business awards and contract modifications, cancellations, and the amount of service revenue recognized under existing contracts. Our backlog at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively.\nIndustry Trends\nISR estimated in its ISR 2016 Market Report that the size of the worldwide CRO market was approximately $28 billion in 2015 and will grow at a 7% CAGR to $38 billion over the next five years. This growth will be driven by an increase in the amount of research and development expenditures and higher levels of clinical development outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies.\nAcquisition of PRA by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P.\nEffective September 23, 2013, we were acquired by affiliates of KKR for $1.4 billion pursuant to a plan of merger by and among the Company, merger sub and Genstar, or Merger. Upon completion of the KKR Transaction, merger sub was merged with and into PRA Holdings, Inc., Predecessor Company, which became a subsidiary of Pinnacle Holdco Parent, Inc., or Parent. On December 19, 2013, Pinnacle Holdco Parent, Inc. changed its name to PRA Global Holdings, Inc. and on July 10, 2014, PRA Global Holdings, Inc. changed its name to PRA Health Sciences, Inc.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed a number of acquisitions in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas. On February 28, 2013, the Predecessor Company acquired all of the outstanding member's interest of ClinStar, LLC, or ClinStar, a contract research organization and logistics provider based in the United States with operations in Eastern Europe, for $45.0 million in cash and contingent consideration in the form of a potential earn-out payment of up to $5.0 million. On September 23, 2013, immediately following the Merger, and using proceeds from the borrowings issued on the same day, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of RPS Parent Holding Corp., or RPS, a global contract research organization based in the United States, for $289.3 million, subject to a working capital adjustment of up to $15.0 million. The acquisition of RPS provides the Company with a more diverse client mix, including 16 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. On December 2, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of CRI Holding Company, LLC, or CRI Lifetree, a specialized research organization, for $77.1 million in cash. CRI Lifetree focuses on the conduct and design of early stage, patient population studies, and is therapeutically focused in human abuse liability, addiction, pain, psychiatry, neurology, pediatric and infectious disease services. On June 8, 2015, the Company purchased the assets of Value Health Solutions Inc., or VHS, a software development firm, for $0.5 million in cash and 47,598 unregistered shares of the Company's common stock with a fair market value of $1.6 million; an additional $0.4 million of common stock will be issued in June 2017, less amounts reimbursable to the Company for any indemnification obligations of the seller. The asset purchase agreement also includes contingent consideration in the form of potential earn-out payments of up to $16.0 million. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included since the date of acquisition.\nSee Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to these acquisitions.\nJoint Ventures\nIn December 2012, we signed a joint venture agreement with WuXi to offer a broad platform of Phase I-IV clinical trial services in China, Hong Kong and Macau. The joint venture provides services including clinical trial monitoring, project management, regulatory strategy and submissions, data management, biostatistics, drug safety reporting, and medical monitoring. The clinical operations of WuXi and PRA in China were combined to operate as an independent contract research organization, WuXiPRA Clinical Research Co., Ltd, or WuxiPRA; the joint venture is jointly owned by PRA (49%) and WuXi (51%).\nWe contributed $4.6 million to the joint venture during March 2013, and during April 2015, we made an additional $3.0 million contribution to WuXiPRA, along with WuXi, to fund the joint venture's working capital needs. Our interests in WuXiPRA remains at 49% after the capital contribution. We recorded reductions to the investment balance of $2.9 million and $2.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, $0.7 million during the Successor period from September 23, 2013 to December 31, 2013 and $0.8 million during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2013 to September 22, 2013, respectively, for our equity in the venture's net loss for the period, which is recorded in the equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment will be adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting. The investment in WuXiPRA totaled $1.1 million and $1.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOn December 4, 2015, we signed a framework agreement with WuXi to dissolve the WuXiPRA joint venture. Under the new arrangement, the portion of the joint venture located in mainland China will become a wholly owned subsidiary of WuXi, and the portion of the joint venture located in Hong Kong will become a wholly owned subsidiary of PRA. In addition, we will retain our Strategic Solutions\nbusiness in China and Hong Kong. We will form a preferred provider relationship with WuXi under which WuXi will provide full-service clinical trial services for global clinical trials subcontracted by us in China. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2016.\nIn March 2013, RPS entered into a joint venture agreement with A2 Healthcare Corporation (formerly part of Asklep, Inc.). The joint venture provides research and development outsourcing solutions in Japan to the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries. This joint venture is based in Tokyo, Japan and is owned by PRA (49%) and A2 Healthcare Corporation (51%). On October 17, 2014, the joint venture changed its name from RPS Asklep, Inc. to A2PRA Corporation, or A2PRA. There was no change in the investment balance during the year ended December 31, 2015. We recorded a $0.1 million reduction to the investment balance during the year ended December 31, 2014 and there was no change in the investment balance during the Successor 2013 Period, for our equity in the venture's net loss for the period, which is recorded in the equity in losses of unconsolidated joint venture, net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment will be adjusted for RPS's equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting. The investment in A2PRA totaled $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn August 2015, the Company and an affiliate of KKR entered into a joint venture. The joint venture was dissolved in December 2015. The purpose of the joint venture included, among other things, the evaluation of investments or acquisitions to enhance the strategic objectives of the Company. The joint venture was jointly owned by the Company (11%) and KKR (89%). The Company contributed $20.0 million to the joint venture in August 2015 and received $19.5 million when the joint venture was dissolved. The Company recorded the $0.5 million reduction to the investment balance in equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. The investment in the joint venture was adjusted for the Company's equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions, and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting.\nSources of Revenue\nTotal revenues are comprised of service revenue and reimbursement revenue, each of which is described below.\nService Revenue\nWe generally enter into contracts with customers to provide services with payments based on either fixed-fee, time and materials, or fee-for-service arrangements. Revenue for services is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nOnce these criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for the services provided on fixed-fee contracts based on the proportional performance methodology, which determines the proportion of outputs or performance obligations which have been completed or delivered compared to the total contractual outputs for performance obligations. To measure performance, we compare the contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. As part of the client proposal and contract negotiation process, we develop a detailed project budget for the direct costs based on the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the geographical location involved and our historical experience. We then establish the individual contract pricing based on our internal pricing guidelines, discount agreements, if any, and negotiations with the client. The estimated total contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts, with adjustments to revenue resulting from such revisions being recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are first identified. Revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as hours are incurred. Billable hours typically fluctuate during the terms of individual contracts, as services we provide\ngenerally increase at the beginning of a study and decrease toward the end of a study. Revenues and the related costs of fee-for-service contracts are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nA majority of our contracts undergo modifications over the contract period and our contracts provide for these modifications. During the modification process, we recognize revenue to the extent we incur costs, provided client acceptance and payment is deemed reasonably assured.\nWe often offer volume discounts to our large customers based on annual volume thresholds. We record an estimate of the annual volume rebate as a reduction of revenue throughout the period based on the estimated total rebate to be earned for the period.\nMost of our contracts can be terminated by the client either immediately or after a specified period, typically 30 to 60 days, following notice. In the case of early termination, these typically contracts require payment to us of fees earned to date, the fees, and in some cases, a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early. Based on ethical, regulatory, and health considerations, this wind-down activity may continue for several quarters or years. Therefore, revenue recognized prior to cancellation generally does not require a significant adjustment upon cancellation.\nIncreases in the estimated total direct costs to complete a contract without a corresponding proportional increase to the total contract price result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized in the period the change in estimate is determined.\nOur service revenue was $1,375.8 million and $1,266.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, $324.4 million for the period from September 23, 2013 to December 31, 2013, or the Successor 2013 Period, and $508.5 million for the period from January 1, 2013 to September 22, 2013, or the Predecessor 2013 Period. Changes in service revenue from period to period are driven primarily by changes in backlog at the beginning of a period, as well as new business awards during such period. Additionally, service revenue and billable hours will generally be impacted by the mix of studies that are active during a period, as different studies have different staffing requirements, as well as the life cycles of projects that are active during a period.\nOur service revenues are derived from a wide range of client types. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived 48% of our service revenue from large pharmaceutical companies, 15% of our service revenue from small- to mid-sized pharmaceutical companies, 22% of our service revenue from large biotechnology companies and 15% of our service revenue from emerging biotechnology companies. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our top five clients represented approximately 41%, 38%, and 30%, respectively, of service revenue; this revenue was derived from a combination of fixed-fee contracts, fee-for-service contracts and time and materials contracts. One client accounted for 10.7% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015. No individual project accounted for 10% or more of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. No client or individual project accounted for 10% or more of service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nReimbursement Revenue and Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Costs\nWe incur out-of-pocket costs, which are reimbursable by our customers. We include these out-of-pocket costs as reimbursement revenue and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.\nAs is customary in our industry, we also routinely enter into separate agreements on behalf of our clients with independent physician investigators in connection with clinical trials. We also receive funds from our clients for investigator fees, which are netted against the related costs, since such fees are the obligation of our clients, without risk or reward to us. We are not obligated either to perform the service or to pay the investigator in the event of default by the client. In addition, we do not pay the\nindependent physician investigator until funds are received from the client. Accordingly, unlike reimbursable out-of-pocket costs, we do not recognize these investigator fees in revenue.\nReimbursement costs and investigator fees are not included in our backlog because they are pass-through costs to our clients.\nWe believe that the fluctuations in reimbursement costs and reimbursement revenue from period to period are not meaningful to our underlying performance.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our direct costs, selling, general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. In addition, we incur reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses; however, as noted above, our reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses are directly offset by our reimbursement revenue. Since reimbursement revenue is offset by our out-of-pocket reimbursable expenses, we monitor and measure costs as a percentage of service revenue rather than total revenue as we believe this is a more meaningful comparison and better reflects the operations of our business.\nDirect Costs\nOur direct costs consist primarily of labor-related charges. They include elements such as salaries, benefits and incentive compensation for our employees. In addition, we utilize staffing agencies to procure primarily part time individuals to perform work on our contracts. Labor-related charges as a percentage of our total direct costs were 95.7% and 94.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 96.5% for the Successor 2013 Period and 93.3% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The cost of labor procured through staffing agencies is included in these percentages and represent 4.1% and 5.1% of total direct cost for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 2.1% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 3.4% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Our remaining direct costs are items such as travel, meals, postage and freight, patient costs, medical waste and supplies. The total of all these items as a percentage of total direct cost were 4.3% and 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 3.5% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 6.7% for the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nHistorically, direct costs have increased with an increase in service revenues. The future relationship between direct costs and service revenues may vary from historical relationships. Direct costs as a percentage of service revenues were 64.4% and 67.8% during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 68.7% for the Successor 2013 Period, and 59.8% for the Predecessor 2013 Period. On a forward looking basis, as a result of the acquisition of RPS which operates at a lower margin than we have historically experienced, we expect our direct costs as a percent of service revenue to be in the 65% to 70% range. Several factors will cause direct costs to decrease as a percentage of service revenues. Deployment of our billable staff in an optimally efficient manner has the most impact on our ratio of direct cost to service revenue. The most effective deployment of our staff is when they are fully engaged in billable work and are accomplishing contract related activities at a rate that meets or exceeds budgeted targets. We also seek to optimize our efficiency by performing work using the employee with the lowest cost. Generally, the following factors may cause direct costs to increase as a percentage of service revenues: our staff are not fully deployed, as is the case when there are unforeseen cancellations or delays, or when our staff are accomplishing tasks at levels of effort that exceed budget, such as rework; as well as pricing pressure from increased competition.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of administration payroll and benefits, marketing expenditures, and overhead costs such as information technology and facilities costs. These\nexpenses also include central overhead costs that are not directly attributable to our operating business and include certain costs related to insurance, professional fees and property.\nLoss on Modification or Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on modification of debt consists of debt financing costs that were expensed due to the modification of Predecessor and Successor debt as a result of debt amendments or debt repayments.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt consists of previously capitalized unamortized debt financing costs and prepayment penalty that were expensed as a result of the extinguishment of Predecessor debt as a result of the PRA Acquisition and Successor debt as a result of the repricing and the debt repayment in conjunction with our initial public offering, or IPO.\nTransaction-Related Costs\nTransaction-related costs consist of expenses incurred that relate directly to the KKR Transaction, the acquisition of RPS, and the acquisition of CRI Lifetree. These expenses include attorney, accounting, advisory fees, and transaction-related bonuses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation represents the depreciation charged on our fixed assets. The charge is recorded on a straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of three to seven years for computer hardware and software and five to seven years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the life of the lease term or the useful life of the improvements. Amortization expense consists of amortization recorded on acquisition-related intangible assets. Customer relationships, backlog and finite-lived trade names are amortized on an accelerated basis, which coincides with the period of economic benefit we expect to receive. All other finite-lived intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis. In accordance with GAAP, we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nBecause we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among several different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate can also vary based on changes in the tax rates of the different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by tax credits and the establishment or release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and tax reserves, as well as significant non-deductible items such as portions of transaction-related costs.\nForeign subsidiaries are taxed separately in their respective jurisdictions. We have foreign net operating loss carryforwards in some jurisdictions. The carryforward periods for these losses vary from five years to an indefinite carryforward period depending on the jurisdiction. Our ability to offset future taxable income with the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in certain instances, including changes in ownership.\nExchange Rate Fluctuations\nThe majority of our foreign operations transact in the Euro or Pound Sterling. As a result, our revenue and expenses are subject to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to these currencies. We have translated these currencies into U.S. Dollars using the following average exchange rates:\n\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n\nService revenue increased by $109.3 million, or 8.6%, from $1,266.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $1,375.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 benefited from an increase in billable hours and the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies, offset by an unfavorable impact of $45.4 million from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, and more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several years. The increase in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients.\nDirect costs increased by $27.3 million, or 3.2%, from $859.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $886.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in direct costs was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits of $104.3 million, as we continued to hire billable staff to support our current projects and as we hired additional staff in anticipation of our growing portfolio of studies, offset by an $8.3 million benefit due to the favorable\nimpact of the research and development credits, or R&D Credits, recorded in the current period that relate to prior tax years and a favorable impact of $64.2 million from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The R&D Credits are the result of a comprehensive analysis we have been performing across the organization to determine whether expenditures incurred qualify as research and development as defined by the respective jurisdiction. Direct costs as a percentage of service revenue decreased from 67.8% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 64.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is primarily due to the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of the R&D Credits.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $7.6 million, or 3.0%, from $254.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $246.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue decreased from 20.1% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 17.9% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to our continued ability to effectively manage our selling and administrative functions and a termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $18.6 million, or 19.3%, from $96.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $78.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue was 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 5.7% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue is primarily due the continued decline in amortization of our acquired intangibles, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $20.2 million from $81.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $61.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in interest expense is related to the paydowns to our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes made using proceeds from our IPO in November 2014 and repayments made to our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during 2015.\nLosses on modification or extinguishment of debt were $25.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and there were no losses on modification of debt during the year ended December 31, 2015. The $25.0 million loss on modification or extinguishment of debt incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a $1.4 million loss on modification debt as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and a $23.7 million loss on modification debt due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with our IPO.\nForeign currency gains, net increased by $3.5 million from $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The foreign currency gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, and gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment.\nProvisions for (benefit from) income taxes increased by $38.2 million from a benefit of $8.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to an income tax provision of $30.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate was 26.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015 and was a benefit rate of 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to fact that the Company was in an overall pre-tax income position for\nthe year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to an overall pre-tax loss for the year-ended December 31, 2014.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Predecessor 2013 Period\n\nService revenue was $1,266.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $508.5 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from an increase in billable hours and an increase in the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, and the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several years. The increased levels of new business awards and backlog acquired in connection with our acquisitions had the effect of increasing our backlog by $734.2 million as of December 31, 2014 as compared to September 22, 2013. The increase in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients. The acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree resulted in $496.0 million of incremental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDirect costs were $859.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $304.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Direct costs were 67.8% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 59.8% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 8.0% increase in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is due to an increase in salaries and benefits as we continue to hire billable staff to support our current projects and as we hire additional staff in anticipation of our growing portfolio of studies. In addition, a significant portion of the increase in salaries and benefits relates to the acquisition of RPS, which typically requires higher staffing levels and which operates at a lower margin than we have historically experienced.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $142.9 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.1% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 28.1% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 8.0% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits as we realize synergies from our acquisitions, and our continued leverage of our selling and administrative functions, partially offset by the termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO. Additionally, the Predecessor 2013 Period included $23.6 million in stock-based compensation expense associated with the payment we made to holders of vested service-based stock options in connection with the February 2013 dividend to option holders and the accelerated vesting of unvested options related to the KKR Transaction in the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nThere were no transaction-related costs for year ended December 31, 2014 and transaction-related costs were $47.5 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The costs incurred in the Predecessor 2013 Period were attributable to the KKR Transaction and the acquisition of ClinStar.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $25.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Depreciation and amortization expense was 7.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 4.9% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to the increased amortization expense resulting from the KKR Transaction and the acquisitions of RPS and CRI Lifetree.\nInterest expense, net was $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $32.7 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Interest expense was 6.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 6.4% of service revenue during the Predecessor 2013 Period. The 0.1% increase in interest expense as a percentage of service revenue was related to the additional debt incurred related to the September 2013 refinancing transactions.\nLosses on modification or extinguishment of debt were $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $21.7 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The loss on modification or extinguishment of debt of $25.0 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the loss on modification debt of $1.4 million as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and the loss on modification debt of $23.7 million due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written-off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with our IPO. The Predecessor 2013 Period amount is primarily attributable to the write-off of $15.2 million of previously recorded unamortized debt issuance costs and a prepayment penalty of $4.8 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period, which was due to the KKR Transaction.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net, were gains of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and losses of $3.6 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. The foreign exchange gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and the settling and revaluation of accounts that are denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nBenefit from income taxes was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $22.1 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 31.5% in the Predecessor 2013 Period. The decrease in the effective tax rate of 12.0% was primarily attributable an increase in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Successor 2013 Period\n\nService revenue was $1,266.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $324.4 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from an increase in billable hours and was offset in part by a decrease in the effective rate of the hours billed on our studies. The growth in service revenue and the increase in billable hours were due largely to the increase in our backlog as we entered the year, the type of services we are providing on our active studies, which was driven by the life cycles of projects that were active during the period, and the growth in new business awards as a result of higher demand for our services across the industries we serve, more effective sales efforts and the growth in the overall CRO market. New business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial. The decrease in our effective rate of the hours billed on our studies is attributable to the contract pricing terms on our current mix of active studies and the mix of clients and the services that we provide to those clients. In addition, a portion of the effective rate decrease is related to certain customers in our portfolio receiving more favorable pricing depending on the volume of business they contract with us. The number of awards can vary significantly from period to period and our studies have terms ranging from several months to several\nyears. The acquisition of CRI Lifetree resulted in $31.5 million of incremental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDirect costs were $859.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $222.8 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Direct costs were 67.8% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 68.7% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The 0.9% decrease in direct costs as a percentage of service revenue is primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits expense, which was driven by our continued focus on leveraging our billable staff and the continued integration of our acquisitions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $69.7 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.1% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 21.5% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The 1.4% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue was primarily related to a decrease in salaries and benefits as we realize synergies from our acquisitions and our continued leverage of our selling and administrative functions, partially offset by the termination fee of $11.9 million we paid KKR in connection with the completion of the IPO.\nThere were no transaction-related costs for year ended December 31, 2014 and transaction-related costs were $29.2 million during the Successor 2013 Period. The costs incurred in the Successor 2013 Period were attributable to the KKR Transaction and the acquisition of CRI Lifetree.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $25.3 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Depreciation and amortization expense 7.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 7.8% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The small decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the finalizing of our intangible asset valuations associated with the Merger and the RPS, ClinStar and CRI Lifetree acquisitions.\nInterest expense, net was $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $23.7 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Interest expense was 6.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 7.3% of service revenue during the Successor 2013 Period. The 0.8% decrease in interest expense as a percentage of total revenue was primarily related to the March 2014 repricing and the repayment of debt following our IPO.\nLosses on modification or extinguishment of debt were $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $7.2 million for the Successor 2013 Period. The loss on modification or extinguishment of debt of $25.0 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the loss on modification debt of $1.4 million as a result of our repricing transaction which took place on March 24, 2014, and the loss on modification debt of $23.7 million due to a $14.3 million prepayment penalty and $9.4 million of unamortized debt costs being written-off as a result of our repayment which took place on November 18, 2014 in conjunction with the IPO. The Successor 2013 Period amount represented a bank financing fee of $5.6 million on the bridge loan associated with the KKR Transaction that was not needed due to the successful completion of the offering of our Senior Notes and a loss of $1.6 million related to debt financing cost expensed as a result of the additional borrowings on December 2, 2013.\nForeign currency gains (losses), net, were gains of $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and losses of $4.1 million for the Successor 2013 Period. The foreign exchange gains and losses are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and the settling and revaluation of accounts that are denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nBenefit from income taxes was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $17.2 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014 and 30.3% in the Successor 2013 Period. The decrease in the effective tax rate of 10.8% were primarily attributable to an increase in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions.\nSeasonality\nAlthough our business is not generally seasonal, we typically experience a slight decrease in our revenue growth rate during the fourth quarter due to holiday vacations and a similar decrease in new business awards in the first quarter due to our clients' budgetary cycles and vacations during the year-end holiday period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $121.1 million of cash and cash equivalents of which $38.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for capital expenditures, expansion of services, geographic expansion, and other general corporate purposes. We have historically funded our operations and growth, including acquisitions, with cash flow from operations, borrowings, and issuances of equity securities. We expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and investments. We expect these activities will be funded from existing cash, cash flow from operations and, if necessary or appropriate, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities. Our sources of liquidity could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients, compliance with regulations, international risks, and personal injury, environmental or other material litigation claims.\nCash Collections\nCash collections from accounts receivable were $1,831.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, including $231.4 million of funds received from customers to pay independent physician investigators, or investigators, as compared to $1,654.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, including $248.2 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators, $475.3 million during the Successor 2013 Period, including $61.5 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators and $797.0 million during the Predecessor 2013 Period, including $150.4 million of funds received from customers to pay investigators. The increase in cash collections during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Successor 2013 Period and the Predecessor 2013 Period is related to our increase in revenue, driven by an increase in new business awards and backlog, and the acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree and improved cash payment schedules contained in our master service agreements and our statements of work.\nDiscussion of Cash Flows\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $130.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in operating cash flow reflects an increase in net income, a reduction in interest payments, as well as reduction in cash outflows from working capital. Interest payments decreased by $26.1 million, primarily due to the debt payments made in conjunction with the IPO during November 2014. Additionally, net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $14.3 million prepayment penalty on the Senior Notes and a $11.9 million fee paid to terminate our monitoring agreement with KKR. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, contributed to a $31.3 million improvement in cash flow from operations and reflects a slower rate of increase in our DSO in 2015 as compared to 2014. DSO can shift significantly at each reporting period depending on\nthe timing of cash receipts under contractual payment terms relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operations was $22.7 million compared to net cash used in operations of $23.9 million for the Successor 2013 Period. Cash provided by operating activities increased over the prior year as a result of an increase in our income from operations, primarily due to transaction-related costs incurred in connection with the KKR Transaction during the Successor 2013 Period. The increase was partially offset by increased net working capital, driven by an increase in our DSO, resulting from a change in customer composition after the acquisitions of ClinStar, RPS and CRI Lifetree.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operations was $22.7 million compared to net cash provided by operations of $49.2 million for the Predecessor 2013 Period. Cash provided by operating activities decreased over the prior year due to decreased cash flows from our net working capital, driven by outflows from accounts receivable and decreased inflows from accounts payable and other liabilities. The outflows from our accounts receivable is related to an increase in our DSO. The decreased inflows related to accounts payable and other liabilities is attributable a decrease in transaction-related expense associated with the KKR Transaction, which we had accrued for in the Predecessor 2013 Period.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $59.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in the cash outflows was due, in part, to a $32.9 million payment for the termination of our interest rate swaps during 2015. Cash flows relating to working capital adjustments associated with our recent acquisitions contributed to an additional $17.5 million of the change. A $5.5 million increase in fixed asset purchases during 2015, primarily related to our new bioanalytical laboratory in the Netherlands and the capitalized software costs for our new Predictivv platform, also contributed to the change.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1,019.0 million and $60.2 million for the Successor 2013 Period and the Predecessor 2013 Period, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we made $27.3 million in purchases of fixed assets offset by $15.9 million in collections of an acquisition-related receivable due from the former owners of RPS and CRI Lifetree. During the Successor 2013 Period, PRA Holdings was acquired for $667.4 million by KKR and acquired RPS Holdings, Inc. for $268.7 million. During the Predecessor 2013 Period, we acquired ClinStar for $40.8 million and made $14.8 million in purchases of fixed assets.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $42.4 million compared to $8.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the same period in 2014. During 2015, we voluntarily repaid $40.0 million on our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO and we repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.3 million compared to $1,115.0 million of net cash provided by financing activities during the Successor 2013 Period. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO. We repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt during the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $302.1 million was paid using proceeds from our IPO. In addition, we\nborrowed $105.0 million and repaid $115.0 million from our existing line of credit, which includes payments made on balances outstanding at December 31, 2013. During the Successor 2013 Period in connection with the KKR Transaction, the acquisition of RPS and the acquisition of CRI Lifetree, we borrowed funds under a new Senior Secured Credit Facility and issued Senior Notes, which resulted in $1,206.2 million of net borrowings. In addition, we repaid our then existing term loan and subordinated debt which resulted in a payment of $567.1 million. We also borrowed $50.0 million and repaid $40.0 million from our existing line of credit. In addition, we received $454.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of 38,782,463 shares of common stock in connection with the PRA Acquisition and $13.5 million from the issuance of 1,151,194 shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of CRI Lifetree. In addition, former members of CRI Lifetree's management contributed $2.1 million to purchase 179,075 shares of our common stock. Finally, former members of RPS's management converted $1.8 million of RPS stock options and equity into 155,288 shares of our common stock. This conversion was accounted for as a non-cash transaction in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.3 million compared to $37.3 million used in the Predecessor 2013 Period. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $328.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 19,523,255 shares of common stock in connection with our IPO. We repaid $308.8 million of previously existing bank and subordinated debt during the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $302.1 million was paid using proceeds from our IPO. In addition, we borrowed $105.0 million and repaid $115.0 million from our existing line of credit, which includes payments made on balances outstanding at December 31, 2013. During the Predecessor 2013 Period, we borrowed $93.2 million of incremental funds for the February 2013 acquisition of ClinStar and a payment of a dividend. The cash generated was offset by a $127.3 million use in the form of a dividend payment to our stockholders and the related payment to holders of vested service-based stock options in February 2013.\nIndebtedness\nIn September 2013, we entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities with a syndicate of banks led by UBS. We terminated our old credit facilities dated December 10, 2012. In September 2013, we also issued $375.0 million of our Senior Notes. The proceeds from our borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our issuance of the Senior Notes were used in conjunction with the acquisition by KKR, to fund the acquisition of RPS, repay existing debt, and pay for fees and expenses related to the aforementioned events. We paid $42.8 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes, which are recorded in deferred financing fees on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn September 2013, PRA Holdings signed a commitment letter with certain lenders for a senior secured one year bridge loan, or the bridge loan, to ensure financing would be available for the RPS Acquisition in the event that the offering of the Senior Notes was not closed by the date of closing of the RPS Acquisition. Due to the closing of the issuance of the Senior Notes, the bridge loan was terminated. At the closing of the issuance of the Senior Notes and the RPS Acquisition, a commitment fee of $5.6 million was paid to the lenders who provided the bridge loan commitment; this amount is included in the Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt line on the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn December 2, 2013, we borrowed an incremental $65.0 million under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of CRI Lifetree.\nOn March 24, 2014, we completed a repricing transaction associated with the first lien term loan that reduced the applicable margin from 4.0% to 3.5%. The repricing resulted in the write-off of $1.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs, which are included in loss on modification or extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn November 18, 2014, we repaid $152.1 million in principal on our Senior Notes and $150.0 million in principal on our Term Loan using proceeds from our IPO. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 470-50, Debt-modifications and Extinguishments, the debt repayment was accounted for as a partial debt extinguishment. The repayment resulted in a $14.3 million prepayment penalty on our Senior Notes, as well as the write-off of $9.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs, which are included in loss on modification or extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn February 18, 2016, we commenced an offer to purchase up to $75 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the cash tender offer.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nUBS Securities LLC, Jefferies Finance LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, KKR Capital Markets LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. act as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide senior secured financing of up to $1,015.0 million, consisting of:\n\u2022 the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $890.0 million; and\n\u2022 the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $125.0 million.\nThe borrower of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is PRA Holdings, Inc. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit up to $40.0 million and for up to $20.0 million of borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans.\nOn March 24, 2014, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement with UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as administrative agent, and other agents and lenders party thereto. Pursuant to this Amendment, among other terms contained therein, the principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was increased from $825.0 million to $890.0 million and all lenders agreed to exchange Initial Term Loans under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility for Tranche B-1 Loans with applicable margins of LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum. In addition, this Amendment established a 1.00% premium to prepayments to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility made on or prior to September 24, 2014.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provides that we have the right at any time to request incremental term loans and/or revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to (a) $185.0 million, plus (b) all voluntary prepayments and corresponding voluntary commitment reductions of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, other than from proceeds of refinancing indebtedness, prior to the date of any such incurrence, plus (c) an additional amount which, after giving effect to the incurrence of such amount, we would not exceed a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 4.5 to 1.0 pro forma for such incremental facilities, minus (d) the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of new term loan commitments and new revolving credit commitments incurred and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of certain other indebtedness incurred. The lenders under these facilities are not under any obligation to provide any such incremental commitments or loans, and any such addition of or increase in commitments or loans is subject to certain customary conditions precedent.\nInterest Rate and Fees\nBorrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) LIBOR for the relevant interest period, plus an applicable margin; provided that solely with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility LIBOR shall be deemed to be no less than 1.00% per annum or (b) a base rate, or the Base Rate, equal to the highest of (1) the rate of interest established by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in Stamford, Connecticut, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) LIBOR for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin; provided that solely with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility the Base Rate shall be deemed to be no less than 2.00% per annum.\nThe applicable margin for Base Rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 3.00% per annum, for LIBOR borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 4.00% per annum, for letter of credit loans under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 4.00% per annum, for Base Rate borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is 2.50% per annum, for LIBOR borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is 3.50% per annum. The applicable margins under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will decrease, based upon PRA Holdings' achievement of certain specified consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratios.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, PRA Holdings is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum to the lenders under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee rate will be reduced to 0.375% subject to our achieving a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.25 to 1.0 on a given date. We are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.\nPrepayments\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:\n\u2022 50% of our annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) commencing with the first full fiscal year of the borrower following the date of the closing of the PRA Acquisition and the RPS Acquisition (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if PRA Holdings achieves a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.0, but greater than 3.25 to 1.0 on the date of prepayment for the most recent test period and no prepayment will be required if PRA Holdings achieves a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.0 on the date of prepayment for the most recent test period);\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of insurance proceeds of proceeds of a condemnation award in respect of any casualty to any equipment, fixed assets or real property;\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of permitted sale leasebacks; and\n\u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property in excess of $20.0 million and subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds within 450 days following receipt of the net cash proceeds of such disposition.\nThe foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied first to accrued interest and fees and second, to the scheduled installments of principal of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in direct order of maturity.\nWe may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty (other than as set forth in the immediately succeeding paragraph), subject to reimbursements of the lenders' redeployment costs actually incurred in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period.\nAmortization and Final Maturity\nThe Senior Secured Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, with the balance being payable on the date that is on or about September 23, 2020. Our voluntary prepayments made during 2014, using proceeds from the IPO, fully satisfy all required quarterly principal payments through maturity. Principal amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full at maturity, on or about September 23, 2018.\nGuarantee and Security\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by us and all our material, wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiaries, with customary exceptions including where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences.\nAll obligations of the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of the borrower and each guarantor, including but not limited to: (i) a perfected pledge of all of the capital stock issued by the borrower and each guarantor and (ii) perfected security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and the guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and exclusions).\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022 enter into sale-leaseback transactions\n\u2022 create or incur liens;\n\u2022 engage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022 sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022 restrict distributions to the borrower or restricted subsidiaries from their subsidiaries;\n\u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 pay certain dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022 make investments, loans or advances, prepayments of junior financings or other restricted payments; and\n\u2022 change the conduct of business.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain customary events of default (subject to exceptions, thresholds and grace periods), including, without limitation: (i) nonpayment of principal or interest; (ii) failure to perform or observe covenants; (iii) inaccuracy or breaches of representations and warranties; (iv) cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness; (v) certain bankruptcy related events;\n(vi) impairment of certain security interests in collateral, guarantees or invalidity or unenforceability of certain Senior Secured Credit Facility documents; (vii) monetary judgment defaults; (viii) certain ERISA matters; and (ix) certain change of control events.\nIn addition, the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated net first lien leverage to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 7.5 to 1.0 for any four consecutive fiscal quarters for which financial statements have been provided to the administrative agent as required by the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, when loans plus letters of credit under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (excluding (i) letters of credit existing on the date of the closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any extensions thereof, replacement letters of credit or letters of credit issued in lieu thereof, in each case, to the extent the face amount of such letters of credit is not increased above the face amount of the letter of credit being extended, replaced or substituted and (ii) other non-cash collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $15 million) are or would be outstanding in an amount exceeding 30.0% of the total facility amount under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control.\nSenior Notes\nPRA Holdings has $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.5% senior notes outstanding, which mature on October 1, 2023, pursuant to the indenture. Interest on the notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year.\nRedemption\nOn or prior to October 1, 2018, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nAfter October 1, 2018, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the range of prepayments premiums.\nChange of Control\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, which is defined in the indenture, each holder of the notes has the right to require PRA Holdings to repurchase some or all of such holder's notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\nCovenants\nThe indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, PRA Health Sciences' ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to (subject to certain exceptions):\n\u2022 incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022 pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem equity interests of the issuer, prepay or repurchase subordinated indebtedness, make certain investments;\n\u2022 sell or transfer certain assets;\n\u2022 create liens on certain assets to secure debt;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nEvents of Default\nThe indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the notes to become or to be declared due and payable, including without limitation: (i) nonpayment of principal or interest; (ii) failure to perform or observe covenants; (iii) cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness; (iv) certain bankruptcy related events; (v) impairment of certain security interests in collateral, guarantees or invalidity or unenforceability of certain Senior Secured Credit Facility documents; and (vi) monetary judgment defaults.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our future minimum payments for all contractual obligations and commercial commitments for years subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2015:\n\n(1)Principal payments are based on the terms contained in our credit agreement. Interest payments are based on the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2015.\n(2)Service purchase commitments are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased.\n(3)As of December 31, 2015, our liability related to uncertain income tax positions was approximately $11.7 million, of which $10.8 million has not been included in the above table as we are unable to predict when these liabilities will be paid due to the uncertainties in timing of the settlement of the income tax positions.\n(4)On May 5, 2014, we reached a settlement in the amount of $9.0 million related to a customer dispute. We paid $4.5 million and $1.5 million related to this dispute in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The remaining $3.0 million is payable in installments through December 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements. The term \"off-balance sheet arrangement\" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated\nwith us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our service revenue is recorded regionally on a proportional performance basis. Revenue for service is recognized only after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. To measure performance, we compare contract costs incurred to estimated total contract costs through completion. We believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contract obligations because the costs relate to the amount of labor hours incurred to perform the service. Direct costs are primarily comprised of labor-related charges associated with the delivery of services. Each month we accumulate costs on each project and compare them to the total current estimated costs to determine the proportional performance. We then multiply the proportion completed by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue that can be recognized. Each month we review the total current estimated costs on each project to determine if these estimates are still accurate and, if necessary, we adjust the total estimated costs for each project. During our monthly contract review process, we review each contract's performance to date, current cost trends, and circumstances specific to each study. The original or current cost estimates are reviewed and if necessary the estimates are adjusted and refined to reflect any changes in the anticipated performance under the study. In the normal course of business, we conduct this review each month in all service delivery locations. As the work progresses, original estimates might be deemed incorrect due to, among other things, revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate, and a contract modification might be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs. If not, we bear the risk of costs exceeding our original estimates. Management assumes that actual costs incurred to date under the contract are a valid basis for estimating future costs. Should management's assumption of future cost trends fluctuate significantly, future margins could be reduced. In the past, we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects, resulting in lower margins on those projects. Should our actual costs exceed our estimates on fixed price contracts, future margins could be reduced, absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification. We accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process. Historically, the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct, but these estimates might not continue to be accurate in the future.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIncluded in \"Accounts receivable and unbilled services, net\" on our consolidated balance sheets is an allowance for doubtful accounts. Generally, before we do business with a new client, we perform a\ncredit check, as our allowance for doubtful accounts requires that we make an accurate assessment of our customers' creditworthiness. Approximately 10-20% of our client base is emerging biotech companies, creating a heightened risk related to the creditworthiness for a portion of our client base. We manage and assess our exposure to bad debt on each of our contracts. We age our billed accounts receivable and assess exposure by client type, by aged category, and by specific identification. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Historically, we have not had any write-offs in excess of our allowance. If, at December 31, 2015, our aged accounts receivable balance greater than 90 days were to increase by 10% (for the U.S. operations), no material adjustments to bad debt expense would be required.\nIncome Taxes\nChanges in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of our effective tax rate and, consequently, our operating results. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nWe have to use estimates and judgments in calculating certain tax liabilities and determining the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating losses, tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. We are also required to reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In determining future taxable income, assumptions include the amount of state, federal and international pretax operating income, international transfer pricing policies, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. Based on our analysis of the above factors, we determined that a valuation allowance of $23.2 million was required as of December 31, 2015 relating the net U.S. net deferred tax asset, state net operating loss carryforwards, foreign net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards. Changes in our assumptions could result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance, up or down, in the future.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We determine our liability for uncertain tax positions globally under the provisions in Financial Accounting Standards Board's, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 740, Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2015, we had recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of $11.7 million. If events occur such that payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our calculation of the liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment, a tax expense or benefit to expense, respectively, would result. The total liability reversal that could affect the tax rate is $7.7 million.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with the FASB's ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, as modified and supplemented, we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes model for all options with a service condition or a Monte Carlo model for options with\nmarket and performance conditions. The determination of fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the stock price of similar entities as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected life. In developing our assumption, we take into account the following:\n\u2022 We use the historical volatilities of a selected peer group as we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common share price. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available. For the purpose of identifying peer companies, we consider characteristics such as industry, length of trading history, similar vesting terms and in-the-money option status. We plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common shares is relevant to measure expected volatility for future award grants.\n\u2022 The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options.\n\u2022 The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts.\n\u2022 For those options valued using the Black-Scholes model, the expected life is based upon the guidance provided by the FASB. For those options with a market condition valued under the Monte Carlo model, the expected life varies depending on the target stock price that triggers vesting.\n\u2022 As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our company experience. Current accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nDue to the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors with the assistance of management, based on a number of factors consistent with the methodologies outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of our common stock is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant as listed on the NASDAQ.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAs a result of our acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite-lived acquired intangibles. The identification and valuation of these intangible assets at the time of acquisition require significant management judgment and estimates.\nWe review long-lived asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group might not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. As a result of our acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite-lived acquired intangibles. The identification and valuation of these intangible assets at the time of acquisition require significant management judgment and estimates. In connection with the acquisition of PRA by KKR on September 23, 2013, the purchases of\nClinStar on February 28, 2013, RPS on September 23, 2013, CRI Lifetree on December 2, 2013, and VHS on June 8, 2015, valuations were completed, and value was assigned to identifiable finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, based on the purchase price of the transactions.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of our reporting units. On October 1, 2015, we reviewed goodwill for impairment and our analysis indicated that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, no impairment exists. This model utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the expected future in-flows and outflows of our business and an appropriate discount rate. We test indefinite lived intangible assets, principally trade names, on at least an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the trade name to our carrying value. On October 1, 2015, we reviewed our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and our analysis indicated a fair value in excess of book value. This model utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the expected future in-flows and outflows of our business and an appropriate discount rate. This process is inherently subjective and dependent upon the estimates and assumptions we make. In determining the expected future cash flows of our company, we assume that we will continue to enter into new contracts, execute the work on these contracts profitably, collect receivables from customers, and thus generate positive cash flows. In addition, our analysis could be impacted by future adverse change such as future declines in our operating results, a further significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry or failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecast.\nThe estimated fair value of the EDS reporting unit closely approximated its carrying value when we performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2014. We made operational improvements during 2015 in order to improve the profitability of the EDS reporting unit. As a result of these changes, EDS saw growth in both backlog and new business awards that contributed to its improved financial performance during the year and led to us updating its forecast for future periods. We considered all of these factors when it performed its most recent goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 and it was concluded that the estimated fair value of the EDS reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by $48.9 million or 23%. Any negative changes in assumptions on revenue, new business awards, cancellations, or our ability to improve operations while maintaining a competitive cost structure could adversely affect the fair value of EDS and result in significant goodwill impairment charges in 2016 or later.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value is further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we used Level 3 inputs to measure liabilities totaling $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The liability at December 31, 2015 relates to contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisition of VHS. The liability at December 31, 2014 related to contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisition of ClinStar. No other liabilities or assets are remeasured at fair value.\nInflation\nOur long-term contracts, those in excess of one year, generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date. As a result, we expect that inflation generally will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Historically our projection of inflation contained within our contracts has not significantly impacted our operating income. Should inflation be in excess of the estimates within our contracts our operating margins would be negatively impacted if we were unable to negotiate contract modifications with our clients.\nPotential Liability and Insurance\nOur clients provide us with contractual indemnification for all of our service related contracts. In addition, we attempt to manage our risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients from administration of products under study through measures such as stringent operating procedures and insurance. We monitor our clinical trials in a manner designed to ensure compliance with government regulations and guidelines. We have adopted global standard operating procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the United States and in many foreign countries that serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. We currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe are adequate and appropriate. If our insurance coverage is not adequate to cover actual claims, or if insurance coverage does not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially harmed. Historically we have experienced infrequent and immaterial claims. Should a material claim arise that exceeds our insurance coverage levels, there would be a dollar for dollar impact to operating income for the amount in excess of our insurance coverage.\nDividend History\nWe have not declared or paid dividends during 2015 and 2014. Dividends paid (including the related payments to holders of options) during the Successor 2013 Period totaled $4.3 million and dividends paid during the Predecessor 2013 Period totaled $127.3 million.", "item_7_tables": "Table 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
