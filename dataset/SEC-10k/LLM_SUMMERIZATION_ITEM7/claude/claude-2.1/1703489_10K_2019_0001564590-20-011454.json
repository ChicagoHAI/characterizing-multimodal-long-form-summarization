    "item_7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described below. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe have made significant investments over the last several years in adding experienced bankers, expanding our lending and relationship staff, absorbing the costs of being a public company and upgrading technology and facilities. These investments have increased our operating expenses during those periods. However, during those same periods, we have been able to significantly grow the Bank's loan portfolio while improving its asset quality and strengthening its capital.\nAbrupt changes in interest rates will present us with a challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income as interest rates increase and lowering our interest expense faster than lowering our interest income as interest rates decrease. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may have a favorable affect on our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have a positive effect on our results of operations. As described in -Management of Market Risk,\u201d we expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would react inversely to instantaneous changes in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we promote core deposit products and we are diversifying our loan portfolio by introducing new lending programs. See -Business Strategy\u201d, -Management of Market Risk\u201d and Risk Factors-Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\u201d\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goal is to provide long-term value to our stakeholders, our stockholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve by executing a safe and sound business strategy that produces increasing value. We believe there is a significant opportunity for an immigrant community-focused, minority directed bank to provide a full range of financial services to commercial and retail customers in our market area. The additional capital we obtained from the stock offering of September 29, 2017, continues to enabled us to compete more effectively in the financial services marketplace.\nOur current business strategy consists of the following:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Continue to expand our multifamily and nonresidential loans. The additional capital raised in the stock offering increased our capacity to originate multifamily and nonresidential loans. Under our current board approved loan concentration policy, such loans, including construction and land loans, shall not exceed 400% of our total risk-based capital. Most multifamily and nonresidential loans are originated with adjustable rates and, as a result, these loans are expected to change loan yields due to their shorter repricing terms compared to longer-term fixed-rate loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Community lending programs. The Bank is an authorized direct lender under the Small Business Administration (SBA) and a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). Both of these programs, combined with our pre-existing products, bolster the Bank's commitment to continue to serve the communities that it has supported over the past sixty years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Continue to increase core deposits, with an emphasis on low cost commercial demand deposits, and add non-core funding sources. Deposits are the major source of balance sheet funding for lending and other investments. Certificates of deposits, brokered deposits, and listing service deposits supplement the Bank's funding base. We have made significant investments in new products and services, marketing programs, personnel, branch distribution system as well as enhancing our electronic delivery solutions in an effort to become more competitive in the financial services marketplace and attract more core deposits. Core deposits are our least costly source of funds and represent our best opportunity to develop customer relationships that enable us to cross-sell our enhanced products and services.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Manage credit risk to maintain a low level of nonperforming assets. We believe strong asset quality is a key to our long-term financial success. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined policies and procedures, appropriate loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. The majority of our non-performing assets have been related, largely, to one-to-four family residential loans and, to a lesser extent, construction and land loans. We continue to focus on our credit review function, adding both personnel and ancillary systems, in order to be able to evaluate more complex loans and better manage credit risk, to further support our intended loan growth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expand our employee base to support future growth. We have already made significant investments in our employee base. However, we will continue to work to attract and retain the necessary talent to support increased lending, deposit activities and enhanced information technology.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Grow organically and through opportunistic bank or branch acquisitions. We focus primarily on organic growth as a lower-risk means of deploying our capital. We will fund improvements in our operating facilities and customer delivery services in order to enhance our competitiveness. Opportunistic acquisition possibilities are explored if we believe they would enhance the value of our franchise and yield potential financial benefits for our stakeholders. Although we believe opportunities exist to increase our market share in our current banking locations, we will not be adverse to expanding into nearby markets, enlarging our current branch network, or adding loan production offices, provided we believe such efforts would enhance our competitive standing. Consequently, in 2019 the Company announced entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Mortgage World Bankers, Inc.; we are awaiting regulatory approval.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion contains certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-U.S. GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company's U.S. GAAP financial information. The Company's non-U.S. GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-U.S. GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-U.S. GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-U.S. GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company's results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP measures is provided below.\nThe SEC has exempted from the definition of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on U.S. GAAP. Management believes that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, that information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below includes references to the Company's net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 before deduction of expenses related to termination of the Company's Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Defined Benefit Plan\u201d). In management's view, that information, which is considered non-U.S. GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve comparability of core operations year over year and in future periods. The non-U.S. GAAP net income amount and earnings per share reflect adjustments of the non-recurring charges associated with termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP information to U.S. GAAP net income and earnings per share is provided below.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Reconciliation - Net Income Before Loss on Termination of Defined Benefit Plan (Unaudited)\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Earnings Per\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss - U.S. GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,125\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.29\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on termination of pension plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income before loss on termination of pension plan - non-U.S. GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Basic earnings per share were computed (for the U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. GAAP basis) based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2019 (17,432,318 shares). The assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of restricted stock units were included in computing the non-U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share and do not result in material dilution.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established as probable losses are estimated to occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of the Company's assets and liabilities and results of operations.\nSee Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Results\nDefined Benefit Plan. As has previously been disclosed, on May 31, 2007, the Company's Defined Benefit Plan was frozen and replaced with a qualified defined contribution plan. On May 31, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan which was liquidated on December 1, 2019. During 2019, we offered participants in the Defined Benefit Plan with vested qualified benefits the option of receiving their benefits in a lump sum payment in lieu of receiving monthly annuity payments. Approximately 115 participants elected to receive the lump sum payments aggregating approximately $6.4 million which were paid from plan assets to these participants during the fourth quarter of 2019. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company transferred the remainder of the Defined Benefit Plan's pension obligations to a third party insurance provider by purchasing annuity contracts aggregating approximately $7.4 million which was fully funded directly by plan assets. The benefit obligations settled by the lump sum payments and annuity contracts resulted in payments from plan assets of approximately $13.9 million. The remaining previously unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to the Defined Benefit Plan were recognized as an expense and a pre-tax charge of approximately $9.9 million ($7.8 million after-tax) was recorded in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nShare Repurchases. The Board of Directors approved two repurchase programs of the Company's stock, the first on March 25, 2019 and the second on November 13, 2019. See Note 9, Compensation and Benefit Plans,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase programs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the\nCompany repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $14.30 per share for a total value of $15.8 million pursuant to open market repurchases.\nBasis of Presentation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nFinancial Conditions\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nTotal Assets. Total assets remained essentially unchanged at $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $42.1 million, or 60.3%, to $27.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $69.8 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by a repayment of $25.0 million of short-term advances from a correspondent bank, $15.8 million of repurchases of common stock, a decrease of $27.7 million in deposits, an increase of $42.2 million in gross loans and $34.0 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by an increase of $60.0 million in net advances from FHLBNY, $39.6 million of maturities of available-for-sale securities and $3.6 million from the sale of loans.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities. The composition of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the amounts maturing of each classification are summarized as follows:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government and Federal Agency Securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amounts maturing:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> After three months through one year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> After one year through five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-Backed Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Loans Receivable.

or 3.9%, to $966.1 million at December 31, 2019 from $929.8 million at December 31, 2018.\nCommercial real estate mortgage loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At December 31, 2019, approximately 8.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank's commercial real estate mortgage loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate, compared to 10.1% at December 31, 2018. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on cash flows and valuation of the real estate.\nBanking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank's ratios be in excess of these pronouncements, banking guidelines generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank's policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank's total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank's construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 67.4% and 58.6%, respectively. Investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 349.7% and 313.1% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the Bank was within the 100% ratio for construction and land mortgage loans established by banking guidelines, but exceeded the 300% guideline for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. However, the Bank was within its 400% policy limit established by the Bank's internal loan policy. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank's lending in these areas and is, accordingly, within the monitoring guidelines.\nDeposits.

The Bank's Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a weekly basis to review needs, if any, and to ensure that the Bank is operating within the approved limitations.\nBorrowings. The Bank had outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $104.4 million and $69.4 million, respectively. These borrowings are in the form of advances from the FHLBNY and borrowings from our correspondent banking relationships. The net increase in borrowings was due to new FHLBNY term advances of $90.0 million for a term of three years, at an average rate of 2.0%, offset by the repayment of $30.0 million of FHLBNY term advances (excluding overnight advances) and $25.0 million in short-term advances from a correspondent bank.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity decreased $10.8 million, or 6.4%, to $158.4 million at December 31, 2019, from $169.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease in stockholders' equity was mainly attributable to $15.8 million of stock repurchases, a net loss of $5.1 million offset by a net $7.8 million adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, $1.2 million of expenses related to restricted stock units, $707,000 of expenses related to the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, $311,000 related to unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities and $101,000 of expenses related to stock options.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and dividend income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (991\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income after provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (255\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,847\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (259.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (924\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,045\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (182.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,125\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,802\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (291.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings (loss) per share for the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.29\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (293.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.29\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (293.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral. Consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, was ($5.1 million) compared to a net income of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase of $12.1 million in noninterest expense, mainly due to a $9.9 million ($7.8 million, net of tax effect) loss incurred from the termination of the Company's Defined Benefit Plan, and a decrease of $255,000 in non-interest income offset by an increase of $2.5 million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses and a decrease of $2.0 million in provision for income taxes. Excluding the one-time charge, the Company would have reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.16 per share.\nInterest Income. Interest and dividend income increased $4.3 million, or 9.4%, to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $4.4 million, or 9.7%, increase in interest income on loans, which is our primary source of interest income, offset by a decrease of $0.1 million of other interest and dividend income. Average loan balances increased $79.1 million, or 9.0%, to $946.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $867.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in average loan balances was mainly driven by increases in the multifamily residential, nonresidential, one-to-four family residential, and construction and land mortgage loan portfolios. The average yield on loans increased 3 basis point to 5.21% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1-4 Family residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multifamily residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonresidential properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest income on loans receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income on deposits due from banks and available-for-sale securities and dividend income from FHLBNY stock remained unchanged at $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Average net interest-earning assets increased by $5.1 million, or 2.1%, to $245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $240.3 million for the same period in 2018, due primarily to increases of $64.6 million in average money market accounts and $42.7 million in borrowings offset by a decrease of $36.7 million in certificates of deposit and an increase of $79.1 million in loans. The net interest rate spread decreased by 17 basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 3.57% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the net interest margin was 3.79% and 3.92% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The compression on the net interest margin was primarily caused by organic loan growth being offset by higher market interest rates due to increased competition for deposits and increased funding costs attributed to increased alternative funding.\nManagement continued in 2019 to deploy various asset and liability management strategies to manage the Bank's risk of interest rate fluctuations. Net interest margin decrease 13 basis points in 2019, reflecting that pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors remained very competitive. The Federal Reserve Board reduced the federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points on each of July 31, September 18, and October 30, 2019. Further, on March 3, 2020, and March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board, in emergency actions, decreased the targeted federal funds rate by an aggregate of 150 basis points. These rate cuts were in response to severe market turmoil. As a result of these rate cuts and in the event that short-term interest rates were to be cut further in 2020 or beyond, the Bank's net interest margin will likely be negatively impacted as management's ability to lower funding costs on interest-bearing deposits would more than likely not exceed the pace with which these cuts would impact the Bank's yields on its earning assets. Although it could be anticipated that the Bank's net interest margin may continue to decrease in 2020, we believe net interest income should continue to increase compared to 2019 primarily due to increased average earning asset volumes, primarily loans. Management will continue to seek to fund these increased loan volumes by growing its core deposits, but will utilize funding alternatives, as needed.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish ALLL that, in management's opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans.\nIn evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management's ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic and market conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See -Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Business-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d for additional information.\nAfter an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $258,000 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTo the best of management's knowledge, the Bank recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonably expected. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to the Bank's loan portfolio, could result in material increases in the Bank's provision for loan losses. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews the Bank's allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, the Bank may determine to adjust the allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is management's responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. The Bank has selected a CECL model and has begun assessing plausible scenarios. The extent of the change to ALLL is indeterminable at this time as it will be dependent upon the portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date, as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. The Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with this new accounting standard. Assuming it remains a smaller reporting company, the Company will adopt the CECL standard for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. See Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the CECL standard.\nNon-interest Income. Total non-interest income decreased $255,000, or 8.7%, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to decreases of $530,000 in brokerage commissions and other non-interest income offset by increases of $275,000 in late and prepayment charges and service charges and fees.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Late and prepayment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (209\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (255\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest Expense.

The $12.1 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, is primarily attributable to a one-time charge of $9.9 million for the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, of which $7.8 million was previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a $2.1 million charge-off related to the deferred tax asset associated with the Defined Benefit Plan, an increase of $944,000 in compensation and benefits expense largely as a result of expenses related to restricted stock units and stock options and an increase of $939,000 in occupancy and equipment expense due to the rebranding and branch network renovation initiatives. Other contributing factors were a $208,000 increase in other operating expenses as a result of increases in recruiting fees of $112,000 and $55,000 in expenses related to the repurchase of common shares, a $168,000 increase in data processing expenses as a result of system enhancements and implementation charges related to software upgrades and additional product offerings, a $83,000 increase in professional fees associated with public reporting requirements and a $45,000 increase in insurance and surety bond premium expense. The increase in non-interest expense was partially offset by decreases of $96,000 for direct loan expense, $124,000 for office supplies, telephone and postage and $57,000 for marketing and promotional expenses.\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on termination of pension plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct loan expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance and surety bond premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office supplies, telephone and postage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketing and promotional expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory dues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Expense.

The increase was the result of an overall increase in interest expense on certificates of deposit, savings, money markets, NOW/IOLA and borrowings. Specifically, interest expense on certificates of deposit increased $1.7 million, or 28.7%, to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase resulted from increases in both the average balance of certificates of deposit and the average rate we paid on certificates of deposit. The average balance of certificates of deposit increased $52.5 million, or 13.6%, to $439.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $387.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the average rate we paid on certificates of deposit increased 20 basis points to 1.73% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest expense on savings, money markets, NOW/IOLA and borrowings increased $1.0 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $866,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase resulted from an increase in the average rate we paid on other deposits and borrowings.

Net interest income increased $4.5 million, or 13.8%, to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of higher market yields on earning assets. Our average net interest-earning assets increased by $53.8 million, or 28.9%, to $240.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to our loan growth, described above. Our net interest rate spread decreased by 19 basis points, to 3.57%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our net interest margin was 3.92% and 4.02% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nA material change in interest rates will present us with a challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income if interest rates were to increase. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations. We expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would decrease as a result of a significant increase in interest rates. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may favorably affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have a favorable effect on our results of operations. We expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would increase as a result of a significant decrease in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we are promoting core deposit products while concurrently diversifying our loan portfolio by introducing new lending programs.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provision for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management's ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See -Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Business-Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional information.\nAfter an evaluation of these factors, the Bank decreased the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $467,000, or 27.2%, to $1.2 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $12.7 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $11.1 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses to gross loans decreased to 1.36% at December 31, 2018 from 1.37% at December 31, 2017, and the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans increased to 186.77% at December 31, 2018 from 97.05% at December 31, 2017.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2018. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for loan losses. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, we may determine to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.\nNon-interest Income. Total non-interest income decreased $166,000, or 5.3%, to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a decrease of $204,000 in late and prepayment charges.\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (64\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Late and prepayment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (166\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest Expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, compensation and employee benefits expense increased by $830,000 mainly due to our investment in our employee base, including the senior management team and our sales and relationship management personnel, to help support our continued growth strategy. Occupancy expense increased $848,000, due to the rebranding and improvements of our branches. Professional fees, which primarily include legal and audit expenses, increased $2.1 million. Other operating expenses increased $357,000. Office supplies, telephone and postage increased $206,000. In addition, there was an increase $100,000 in insurance and surety bond expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018. Direct loan expense increased $49,000. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6.3 million, which resulted from the absence of the contribution of 609,279 shares of Company common stock, valued at $6.1 million, and $200,000 in cash to the Ponce De Leon Foundation in 2017. In addition, data processing expenses, decreased by $62,000 mainly due to contractual provisions and the level of new products and services that were introduced during 2018.\nTable 149: <table></table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct loan expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance and surety bond premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office supplies, telephone and postage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charitable foundation contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,293\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketing and promotional expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (93\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory dues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Expense.

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of the Bank's operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank's Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank's assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the Bank's business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis to evaluate the sensitivity to changing interest rates, based on the foregoing considerations.\nThe Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.\nNet Interest Income Simulation Models. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank's earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's level interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year 1 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rate Shift (basis points) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year 1 Forecast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> from Level\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.22\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.61\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.03\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.97\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates.\nThe behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios.\nAt December 31, 2019, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy.\nEconomic Value of Equity Model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model ( EVE\u201d) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At December 31, 2019, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> EVE as a Percentage of Present\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value of Assets (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated Increase (Decrease) in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> EVE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> EVE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rates (basis points) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> EVE (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,514\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.14\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.67\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 170,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,240\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.99\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.06\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 178,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.56\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account\nfactors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2019, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy.\nMost Likely Earnings Simulation Models. Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as based thereon, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies.\nManagement's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank's regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software and external professionals to help ensure that the implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended and in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank's historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank's asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks.\nThe Asset/Liability Committee may determine that the Bank should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The Federal Reserve Board decreased the targeted federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points in each of July 2019, September 2019 and October 2019. On March 3, 2020, and March 15, 2020 the Federal Reserve Board, in emergency actions, decrease this targeted federal funds rate by an aggregate of 150 basis points. These rate cuts were in response to unprecedented market turmoil. We cannot make any representation as to whether, or how many times, the Federal Reserve Board will decrease or increase the targeted federal funds rate in the future.\nGAP Analysis. In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank's interest rate sensitivity \"gap.\" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of our interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of our interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2019, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Time to Repricing\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and economic value tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table.\nInterest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Bank's customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sales securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $104.4 million and $44.4 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through a standby letter of credit of $3.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, there was eligible collateral of approximately $301.8 million in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has an unsecured line of credit of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which there was $0 and $25.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAlthough maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and available-for-sale securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, offset by principal collections on loans, purchases of available-for-sale securities, proceeds from maturing of available-for-sale securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed available-for-sale securities, was $(38.7 million) and $(126.6 million) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in deposit accounts and advances, was $(8.5 million) and $128.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Bank is committed to maintaining an adequate liquidity position. The liquidity position is monitored on a daily basis and it is anticipated that there will be sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, it is anticipated that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change the Company's and the Bank's well capitalized category.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, the Bank routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Bank's future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans, commitments under lines of credit, and standby letters of credit totaling $96.1 million and $104.5 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Bank will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2019 total $217.2 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Bank may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of its operations, the Bank enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 168: <table></table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousand)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vendor obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advances from FHLBNY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 389,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligation\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 522,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 229,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Amounts are for data processing services, leases of equipment and service implementation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of settlement, if any.",
    "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described below. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe have made significant investments over the last several years in adding experienced bankers, expanding our lending and relationship staff, absorbing the costs of being a public company and upgrading technology and facilities. These investments have increased our operating expenses during those periods. However, during those same periods, we have been able to significantly grow the Bank's loan portfolio while improving its asset quality and strengthening its capital.\nAbrupt changes in interest rates will present us with a challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income as interest rates increase and lowering our interest expense faster than lowering our interest income as interest rates decrease. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may have a favorable affect on our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have a positive effect on our results of operations. As described in -Management of Market Risk,\u201d we expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would react inversely to instantaneous changes in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we promote core deposit products and we are diversifying our loan portfolio by introducing new lending programs. See -Business Strategy\u201d, -Management of Market Risk\u201d and Risk Factors-Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\u201d\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goal is to provide long-term value to our stakeholders, our stockholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve by executing a safe and sound business strategy that produces increasing value. We believe there is a significant opportunity for an immigrant community-focused, minority directed bank to provide a full range of financial services to commercial and retail customers in our market area. The additional capital we obtained from the stock offering of September 29, 2017, continues to enabled us to compete more effectively in the financial services marketplace.\nOur current business strategy consists of the following:\n \u2022 Continue to expand our multifamily and nonresidential loans. The additional capital raised in the stock offering increased our capacity to originate multifamily and nonresidential loans. Under our current board approved loan concentration policy, such loans, including construction and land loans, shall not exceed 400% of our total risk-based capital. Most multifamily and nonresidential loans are originated with adjustable rates and, as a result, these loans are expected to change loan yields due to their shorter repricing terms compared to longer-term fixed-rate loans. \n \u2022 Community lending programs. The Bank is an authorized direct lender under the Small Business Administration (SBA) and a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). Both of these programs, combined with our pre-existing products, bolster the Bank's commitment to continue to serve the communities that it has supported over the past sixty years. \n \u2022 Continue to increase core deposits, with an emphasis on low cost commercial demand deposits, and add non-core funding sources. Deposits are the major source of balance sheet funding for lending and other investments. Certificates of deposits, brokered deposits, and listing service deposits supplement the Bank's funding base. We have made significant investments in new products and services, marketing programs, personnel, branch distribution system as well as enhancing our electronic delivery solutions in an effort to become more competitive in the financial services marketplace and attract more core deposits. Core deposits are our least costly source of funds and represent our best opportunity to develop customer relationships that enable us to cross-sell our enhanced products and services. \n \u2022 Manage credit risk to maintain a low level of nonperforming assets. We believe strong asset quality is a key to our long-term financial success. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined policies and procedures, appropriate loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. The majority of our non-performing assets have been related, largely, to one-to-four family residential loans and, to a lesser extent, construction and land loans. We continue to focus on our credit review function, adding both personnel and ancillary systems, in order to be able to evaluate more complex loans and better manage credit risk, to further support our intended loan growth. \n \u2022 Expand our employee base to support future growth. We have already made significant investments in our employee base. However, we will continue to work to attract and retain the necessary talent to support increased lending, deposit activities and enhanced information technology. \n \u2022 Grow organically and through opportunistic bank or branch acquisitions. We focus primarily on organic growth as a lower-risk means of deploying our capital. We will fund improvements in our operating facilities and customer delivery services in order to enhance our competitiveness. Opportunistic acquisition possibilities are explored if we believe they would enhance the value of our franchise and yield potential financial benefits for our stakeholders. Although we believe opportunities exist to increase our market share in our current banking locations, we will not be adverse to expanding into nearby markets, enlarging our current branch network, or adding loan production offices, provided we believe such efforts would enhance our competitive standing. Consequently, in 2019 the Company announced entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Mortgage World Bankers, Inc.; we are awaiting regulatory approval. \nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion contains certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-U.S. GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company's U.S. GAAP financial information. The Company's non-U.S. GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-U.S. GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-U.S. GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-U.S. GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company's results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP measures is provided below.\nThe SEC has exempted from the definition of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on U.S. GAAP. Management believes that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, that information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below includes references to the Company's net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 before deduction of expenses related to termination of the Company's Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Defined Benefit Plan\u201d). In management's view, that information, which is considered non-U.S. GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve comparability of core operations year over year and in future periods. The non-U.S. GAAP net income amount and earnings per share reflect adjustments of the non-recurring charges associated with termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP information to U.S. GAAP net income and earnings per share is provided below.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Reconciliation - Net Income Before Loss on Termination of Defined Benefit Plan (Unaudited)\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Earnings Per\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss - U.S. GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,125\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.29\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on termination of pension plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income before loss on termination of pension plan - non-U.S. GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Basic earnings per share were computed (for the U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. GAAP basis) based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2019 (17,432,318 shares). The assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of restricted stock units were included in computing the non-U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share and do not result in material dilution. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established as probable losses are estimated to occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of the Company's assets and liabilities and results of operations.\nSee Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Results\nDefined Benefit Plan. As has previously been disclosed, on May 31, 2007, the Company's Defined Benefit Plan was frozen and replaced with a qualified defined contribution plan. On May 31, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan which was liquidated on December 1, 2019. During 2019, we offered participants in the Defined Benefit Plan with vested qualified benefits the option of receiving their benefits in a lump sum payment in lieu of receiving monthly annuity payments. Approximately 115 participants elected to receive the lump sum payments aggregating approximately $6.4 million which were paid from plan assets to these participants during the fourth quarter of 2019. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company transferred the remainder of the Defined Benefit Plan's pension obligations to a third party insurance provider by purchasing annuity contracts aggregating approximately $7.4 million which was fully funded directly by plan assets. The benefit obligations settled by the lump sum payments and annuity contracts resulted in payments from plan assets of approximately $13.9 million. The remaining previously unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to the Defined Benefit Plan were recognized as an expense and a pre-tax charge of approximately $9.9 million ($7.8 million after-tax) was recorded in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nShare Repurchases. The Board of Directors approved two repurchase programs of the Company's stock, the first on March 25, 2019 and the second on November 13, 2019. See Note 9, Compensation and Benefit Plans,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase programs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the\nCompany repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $14.30 per share for a total value of $15.8 million pursuant to open market repurchases.\nBasis of Presentation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nFinancial Conditions\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nTotal Assets. Total assets remained essentially unchanged at $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $42.1 million, or 60.3%, to $27.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $69.8 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by a repayment of $25.0 million of short-term advances from a correspondent bank, $15.8 million of repurchases of common stock, a decrease of $27.7 million in deposits, an increase of $42.2 million in gross loans and $34.0 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by an increase of $60.0 million in net advances from FHLBNY, $39.6 million of maturities of available-for-sale securities and $3.6 million from the sale of loans.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities.

or 3.9%, to $966.1 million at December 31, 2019 from $929.8 million at December 31, 2018.\nCommercial real estate mortgage loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At December 31, 2019, approximately 8.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank's commercial real estate mortgage loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate, compared to 10.1% at December 31, 2018. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on cash flows and valuation of the real estate.\nBanking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank's ratios be in excess of these pronouncements, banking guidelines generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank's policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank's total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank's construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 67.4% and 58.6%, respectively. Investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 349.7% and 313.1% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the Bank was within the 100% ratio for construction and land mortgage loans established by banking guidelines, but exceeded the 300% guideline for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. However, the Bank was within its 400% policy limit established by the Bank's internal loan policy. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank's lending in these areas and is, accordingly, within the monitoring guidelines.\nDeposits.

The Bank's Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a weekly basis to review needs, if any, and to ensure that the Bank is operating within the approved limitations.\nBorrowings. The Bank had outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $104.4 million and $69.4 million, respectively. These borrowings are in the form of advances from the FHLBNY and borrowings from our correspondent banking relationships. The net increase in borrowings was due to new FHLBNY term advances of $90.0 million for a term of three years, at an average rate of 2.0%, offset by the repayment of $30.0 million of FHLBNY term advances (excluding overnight advances) and $25.0 million in short-term advances from a correspondent bank.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity decreased $10.8 million, or 6.4%, to $158.4 million at December 31, 2019, from $169.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease in stockholders' equity was mainly attributable to $15.8 million of stock repurchases, a net loss of $5.1 million offset by a net $7.8 million adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, $1.2 million of expenses related to restricted stock units, $707,000 of expenses related to the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, $311,000 related to unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities and $101,000 of expenses related to stock options.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and dividend income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (991\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income after provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (255\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,049\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,847\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (259.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (924\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,045\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (182.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,125\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,802\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (291.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings (loss) per share for the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.29\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (293.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.29\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (293.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral. Consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, was ($5.1 million) compared to a net income of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase of $12.1 million in noninterest expense, mainly due to a $9.9 million ($7.8 million, net of tax effect) loss incurred from the termination of the Company's Defined Benefit Plan, and a decrease of $255,000 in non-interest income offset by an increase of $2.5 million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses and a decrease of $2.0 million in provision for income taxes. Excluding the one-time charge, the Company would have reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.16 per share.\nInterest Income. Interest and dividend income increased $4.3 million, or 9.4%, to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $4.4 million, or 9.7%, increase in interest income on loans, which is our primary source of interest income, offset by a decrease of $0.1 million of other interest and dividend income. Average loan balances increased $79.1 million, or 9.0%, to $946.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $867.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in average loan balances was mainly driven by increases in the multifamily residential, nonresidential, one-to-four family residential, and construction and land mortgage loan portfolios. The average yield on loans increased 3 basis point to 5.21% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1-4 Family residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multifamily residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonresidential properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest income on loans receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income on deposits due from banks and available-for-sale securities and dividend income from FHLBNY stock remained unchanged at $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Net interest income increased $1.5 million, or 4.0%, to $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of organic loan growth offset by higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Average net interest-earning assets increased by $5.1 million, or 2.1%, to $245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $240.3 million for the same period in 2018, due primarily to increases of $64.6 million in average money market accounts and $42.7 million in borrowings offset by a decrease of $36.7 million in certificates of deposit and an increase of $79.1 million in loans. The net interest rate spread decreased by 17 basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 3.57% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the net interest margin was 3.79% and 3.92% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The compression on the net interest margin was primarily caused by organic loan growth being offset by higher market interest rates due to increased competition for deposits and increased funding costs attributed to increased alternative funding.\nManagement continued in 2019 to deploy various asset and liability management strategies to manage the Bank's risk of interest rate fluctuations. Net interest margin decrease 13 basis points in 2019, reflecting that pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors remained very competitive. The Federal Reserve Board reduced the federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points on each of July 31, September 18, and October 30, 2019. Further, on March 3, 2020, and March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board, in emergency actions, decreased the targeted federal funds rate by an aggregate of 150 basis points. These rate cuts were in response to severe market turmoil. As a result of these rate cuts and in the event that short-term interest rates were to be cut further in 2020 or beyond, the Bank's net interest margin will likely be negatively impacted as management's ability to lower funding costs on interest-bearing deposits would more than likely not exceed the pace with which these cuts would impact the Bank's yields on its earning assets. Although it could be anticipated that the Bank's net interest margin may continue to decrease in 2020, we believe net interest income should continue to increase compared to 2019 primarily due to increased average earning asset volumes, primarily loans. Management will continue to seek to fund these increased loan volumes by growing its core deposits, but will utilize funding alternatives, as needed.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish ALLL that, in management's opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans.\nIn evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management's ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic and market conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See -Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Business-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d for additional information.\nAfter an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $258,000 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTo the best of management's knowledge, the Bank recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonably expected. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to the Bank's loan portfolio, could result in material increases in the Bank's provision for loan losses. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews the Bank's allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, the Bank may determine to adjust the allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is management's responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. The Bank has selected a CECL model and has begun assessing plausible scenarios. The extent of the change to ALLL is indeterminable at this time as it will be dependent upon the portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date, as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. The Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with this new accounting standard. Assuming it remains a smaller reporting company, the Company will adopt the CECL standard for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. See Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the CECL standard.\nNon-interest Income. Total non-interest income decreased $255,000, or 8.7%, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to decreases of $530,000 in brokerage commissions and other non-interest income offset by increases of $275,000 in late and prepayment charges and service charges and fees.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Late and prepayment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (209\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (255\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest Expense.

The $12.1 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, is primarily attributable to a one-time charge of $9.9 million for the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, of which $7.8 million was previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a $2.1 million charge-off related to the deferred tax asset associated with the Defined Benefit Plan, an increase of $944,000 in compensation and benefits expense largely as a result of expenses related to restricted stock units and stock options and an increase of $939,000 in occupancy and equipment expense due to the rebranding and branch network renovation initiatives. Other contributing factors were a $208,000 increase in other operating expenses as a result of increases in recruiting fees of $112,000 and $55,000 in expenses related to the repurchase of common shares, a $168,000 increase in data processing expenses as a result of system enhancements and implementation charges related to software upgrades and additional product offerings, a $83,000 increase in professional fees associated with public reporting requirements and a $45,000 increase in insurance and surety bond premium expense. The increase in non-interest expense was partially offset by decreases of $96,000 for direct loan expense, $124,000 for office supplies, telephone and postage and $57,000 for marketing and promotional expenses.\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on termination of pension plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct loan expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance and surety bond premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office supplies, telephone and postage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketing and promotional expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory dues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Expense.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.9 million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses and by decreases of $2.0 million in non-interest expense offset by a decrease of $166,000 in non-interest income.\nInterest Income. Interest and dividend income increased $7.2 million, or 18.4%, to $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $6.8 million, or 17.8%, increase in interest income on loans, which is our primary source of interest income. Average loan balances increased $131.5 million, or 17.9%, to $867.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $735.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in average loan balances was mainly driven by increases in the multifamily residential mortgage, nonresidential mortgage, one-to-four family residential mortgage, and construction and land loan portfolios. The average yield on loans decreased 1 basis point to 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 5.19% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1-4 Family residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multifamily residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonresidential properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest income on loans receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and dividend income on deposits due from banks, available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock increased $391,000, or 47.9%, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $817,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Net interest income increased $4.5 million, or 13.8%, to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of higher market yields on earning assets. Our average net interest-earning assets increased by $53.8 million, or 28.9%, to $240.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to our loan growth, described above. Our net interest rate spread decreased by 19 basis points, to 3.57%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our net interest margin was 3.92% and 4.02% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nA material change in interest rates will present us with a challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income if interest rates were to increase. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations. We expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would decrease as a result of a significant increase in interest rates. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may favorably affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have a favorable effect on our results of operations. We expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would increase as a result of a significant decrease in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we are promoting core deposit products while concurrently diversifying our loan portfolio by introducing new lending programs.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provision for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management's ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See -Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Business-Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional information.\nAfter an evaluation of these factors, the Bank decreased the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $467,000, or 27.2%, to $1.2 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $12.7 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $11.1 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses to gross loans decreased to 1.36% at December 31, 2018 from 1.37% at December 31, 2017, and the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans increased to 186.77% at December 31, 2018 from 97.05% at December 31, 2017.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2018. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for loan losses. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, we may determine to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.\nNon-interest Income. Total non-interest income decreased $166,000, or 5.3%, to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a decrease of $204,000 in late and prepayment charges.\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (64\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Late and prepayment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (166\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest Expense. Total non-interest expense decreased $2.0 million, or 5.5%, to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, compensation and employee benefits expense increased by $830,000 mainly due to our investment in our employee base, including the senior management team and our sales and relationship management personnel, to help support our continued growth strategy. Occupancy expense increased $848,000, due to the rebranding and improvements of our branches. Professional fees, which primarily include legal and audit expenses, increased $2.1 million. Other operating expenses increased $357,000. Office supplies, telephone and postage increased $206,000. In addition, there was an increase $100,000 in insurance and surety bond expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018. Direct loan expense increased $49,000. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6.3 million, which resulted from the absence of the contribution of 609,279 shares of Company common stock, valued at $6.1 million, and $200,000 in cash to the Ponce De Leon Foundation in 2017. In addition, data processing expenses, decreased by $62,000 mainly due to contractual provisions and the level of new products and services that were introduced during 2018.\n \nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct loan expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance and surety bond premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office supplies, telephone and postage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charitable foundation contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,293\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketing and promotional expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (93\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory dues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Expense.

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of the Bank's operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank's Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank's assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the Bank's business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis to evaluate the sensitivity to changing interest rates, based on the foregoing considerations.\nThe Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.\nNet Interest Income Simulation Models. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank's earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's level interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year 1 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rate Shift (basis points) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year 1 Forecast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> from Level\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.22\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.61\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.03\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.97\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. \nAlthough an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates.\nThe behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios.\nAt December 31, 2019, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy.\nEconomic Value of Equity Model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model ( EVE\u201d) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At December 31, 2019, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> EVE as a Percentage of Present\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value of Assets (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated Increase (Decrease) in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> EVE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> EVE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rates (basis points) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> EVE (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,514\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.14\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.67\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 170,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,240\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.99\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.06\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 178,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.03\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.56\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. \n (2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. \n (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. \n (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. \nAlthough an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account\nfactors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2019, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy.\nMost Likely Earnings Simulation Models. Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as based thereon, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies.\nManagement's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank's regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software and external professionals to help ensure that the implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended and in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank's historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank's asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks.\nThe Asset/Liability Committee may determine that the Bank should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The Federal Reserve Board decreased the targeted federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points in each of July 2019, September 2019 and October 2019. On March 3, 2020, and March 15, 2020 the Federal Reserve Board, in emergency actions, decrease this targeted federal funds rate by an aggregate of 150 basis points. These rate cuts were in response to unprecedented market turmoil. We cannot make any representation as to whether, or how many times, the Federal Reserve Board will decrease or increase the targeted federal funds rate in the future.\nGAP Analysis. In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank's interest rate sensitivity \"gap.\" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of our interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of our interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2019, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Time to Repricing\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and economic value tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table.\nInterest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Bank's customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sales securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $104.4 million and $44.4 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through a standby letter of credit of $3.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, there was eligible collateral of approximately $301.8 million in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has an unsecured line of credit of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which there was $0 and $25.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAlthough maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and available-for-sale securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, offset by principal collections on loans, purchases of available-for-sale securities, proceeds from maturing of available-for-sale securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed available-for-sale securities, was $(38.7 million) and $(126.6 million) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in deposit accounts and advances, was $(8.5 million) and $128.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Bank is committed to maintaining an adequate liquidity position. The liquidity position is monitored on a daily basis and it is anticipated that there will be sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, it is anticipated that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change the Company's and the Bank's well capitalized category.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, the Bank routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Bank's future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans, commitments under lines of credit, and standby letters of credit totaling $96.1 million and $104.5 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Bank will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2019 total $217.2 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Bank may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of its operations, the Bank enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2019:\n \nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousand)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vendor obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advances from FHLBNY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 389,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligation\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 522,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 229,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Amounts are for data processing services, leases of equipment and service implementation. \nThe obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of settlement, if any.",
    "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described below. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe have made significant investments over the last several years in adding experienced bankers, expanding our lending and relationship staff, absorbing the costs of being a public company and upgrading technology and facilities. These investments have increased our operating expenses during those periods. However, during those same periods, we have been able to significantly grow the Bank's loan portfolio while improving its asset quality and strengthening its capital.\nAbrupt changes in interest rates will present us with a challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income as interest rates increase and lowering our interest expense faster than lowering our interest income as interest rates decrease. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may have a favorable affect on our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have a positive effect on our results of operations. As described in -Management of Market Risk,\u201d we expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would react inversely to instantaneous changes in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we promote core deposit products and we are diversifying our loan portfolio by introducing new lending programs. See -Business Strategy\u201d, -Management of Market Risk\u201d and Risk Factors-Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\u201d\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goal is to provide long-term value to our stakeholders, our stockholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve by executing a safe and sound business strategy that produces increasing value. We believe there is a significant opportunity for an immigrant community-focused, minority directed bank to provide a full range of financial services to commercial and retail customers in our market area. The additional capital we obtained from the stock offering of September 29, 2017, continues to enabled us to compete more effectively in the financial services marketplace.\nOur current business strategy consists of the following:\n \u2022 Continue to expand our multifamily and nonresidential loans. The additional capital raised in the stock offering increased our capacity to originate multifamily and nonresidential loans. Under our current board approved loan concentration policy, such loans, including construction and land loans, shall not exceed 400% of our total risk-based capital. Most multifamily and nonresidential loans are originated with adjustable rates and, as a result, these loans are expected to change loan yields due to their shorter repricing terms compared to longer-term fixed-rate loans. \n \u2022 Community lending programs. The Bank is an authorized direct lender under the Small Business Administration (SBA) and a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). Both of these programs, combined with our pre-existing products, bolster the Bank's commitment to continue to serve the communities that it has supported over the past sixty years. \n \u2022 Continue to increase core deposits, with an emphasis on low cost commercial demand deposits, and add non-core funding sources. Deposits are the major source of balance sheet funding for lending and other investments. Certificates of deposits, brokered deposits, and listing service deposits supplement the Bank's funding base. We have made significant investments in new products and services, marketing programs, personnel, branch distribution system as well as enhancing our electronic delivery solutions in an effort to become more competitive in the financial services marketplace and attract more core deposits. Core deposits are our least costly source of funds and represent our best opportunity to develop customer relationships that enable us to cross-sell our enhanced products and services. \n \u2022 Manage credit risk to maintain a low level of nonperforming assets. We believe strong asset quality is a key to our long-term financial success. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined policies and procedures, appropriate loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. The majority of our non-performing assets have been related, largely, to one-to-four family residential loans and, to a lesser extent, construction and land loans. We continue to focus on our credit review function, adding both personnel and ancillary systems, in order to be able to evaluate more complex loans and better manage credit risk, to further support our intended loan growth. \n \u2022 Expand our employee base to support future growth. We have already made significant investments in our employee base. However, we will continue to work to attract and retain the necessary talent to support increased lending, deposit activities and enhanced information technology. \n \u2022 Grow organically and through opportunistic bank or branch acquisitions. We focus primarily on organic growth as a lower-risk means of deploying our capital. We will fund improvements in our operating facilities and customer delivery services in order to enhance our competitiveness. Opportunistic acquisition possibilities are explored if we believe they would enhance the value of our franchise and yield potential financial benefits for our stakeholders. Although we believe opportunities exist to increase our market share in our current banking locations, we will not be adverse to expanding into nearby markets, enlarging our current branch network, or adding loan production offices, provided we believe such efforts would enhance our competitive standing. Consequently, in 2019 the Company announced entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Mortgage World Bankers, Inc.; we are awaiting regulatory approval. \nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion contains certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-U.S. GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company's U.S. GAAP financial information. The Company's non-U.S. GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-U.S. GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-U.S. GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-U.S. GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company's results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP measures is provided below.\nThe SEC has exempted from the definition of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on U.S. GAAP. Management believes that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, that information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below includes references to the Company's net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 before deduction of expenses related to termination of the Company's Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Defined Benefit Plan\u201d). In management's view, that information, which is considered non-U.S. GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve comparability of core operations year over year and in future periods. The non-U.S. GAAP net income amount and earnings per share reflect adjustments of the non-recurring charges associated with termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP information to U.S. GAAP net income and earnings per share is provided below.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Reconciliation - Net Income Before Loss on Termination of Defined Benefit Plan (Unaudited)\n\n (1) Basic earnings per share were computed (for the U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. GAAP basis) based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2019 (17,432,318 shares). The assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of restricted stock units were included in computing the non-U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share and do not result in material dilution. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established as probable losses are estimated to occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of the Company's assets and liabilities and results of operations.\nSee Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Results\nDefined Benefit Plan. As has previously been disclosed, on May 31, 2007, the Company's Defined Benefit Plan was frozen and replaced with a qualified defined contribution plan. On May 31, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan which was liquidated on December 1, 2019. During 2019, we offered participants in the Defined Benefit Plan with vested qualified benefits the option of receiving their benefits in a lump sum payment in lieu of receiving monthly annuity payments. Approximately 115 participants elected to receive the lump sum payments aggregating approximately $6.4 million which were paid from plan assets to these participants during the fourth quarter of 2019. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company transferred the remainder of the Defined Benefit Plan's pension obligations to a third party insurance provider by purchasing annuity contracts aggregating approximately $7.4 million which was fully funded directly by plan assets. The benefit obligations settled by the lump sum payments and annuity contracts resulted in payments from plan assets of approximately $13.9 million. The remaining previously unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to the Defined Benefit Plan were recognized as an expense and a pre-tax charge of approximately $9.9 million ($7.8 million after-tax) was recorded in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nShare Repurchases. The Board of Directors approved two repurchase programs of the Company's stock, the first on March 25, 2019 and the second on November 13, 2019. See Note 9, Compensation and Benefit Plans,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase programs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the\nCompany repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $14.30 per share for a total value of $15.8 million pursuant to open market repurchases.\nBasis of Presentation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nFinancial Conditions\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nTotal Assets. Total assets remained essentially unchanged at $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $42.1 million, or 60.3%, to $27.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $69.8 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by a repayment of $25.0 million of short-term advances from a correspondent bank, $15.8 million of repurchases of common stock, a decrease of $27.7 million in deposits, an increase of $42.2 million in gross loans and $34.0 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by an increase of $60.0 million in net advances from FHLBNY, $39.6 million of maturities of available-for-sale securities and $3.6 million from the sale of loans.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities. The composition of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the amounts maturing of each classification are summarized as follows:\n\nGross Loans Receivable. The composition of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows:\n\nThe composition of the loan portfolio increased $36.3 million, or 3.9%, to $966.1 million at December 31, 2019 from $929.8 million at December 31, 2018.\nCommercial real estate mortgage loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At December 31, 2019, approximately 8.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank's commercial real estate mortgage loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate, compared to 10.1% at December 31, 2018. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on cash flows and valuation of the real estate.\nBanking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank's ratios be in excess of these pronouncements, banking guidelines generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank's policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank's total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank's construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 67.4% and 58.6%, respectively. Investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 349.7% and 313.1% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the Bank was within the 100% ratio for construction and land mortgage loans established by banking guidelines, but exceeded the 300% guideline for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. However, the Bank was within its 400% policy limit established by the Bank's internal loan policy. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank's lending in these areas and is, accordingly, within the monitoring guidelines.\nDeposits. The composition of deposits at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows:\n\nWhen wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Bank's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Bank's Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a weekly basis to review needs, if any, and to ensure that the Bank is operating within the approved limitations.\nBorrowings. The Bank had outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $104.4 million and $69.4 million, respectively. These borrowings are in the form of advances from the FHLBNY and borrowings from our correspondent banking relationships. The net increase in borrowings was due to new FHLBNY term advances of $90.0 million for a term of three years, at an average rate of 2.0%, offset by the repayment of $30.0 million of FHLBNY term advances (excluding overnight advances) and $25.0 million in short-term advances from a correspondent bank.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity decreased $10.8 million, or 6.4%, to $158.4 million at December 31, 2019, from $169.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease in stockholders' equity was mainly attributable to $15.8 million of stock repurchases, a net loss of $5.1 million offset by a net $7.8 million adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, $1.2 million of expenses related to restricted stock units, $707,000 of expenses related to the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, $311,000 related to unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities and $101,000 of expenses related to stock options.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\nGeneral. Consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, was ($5.1 million) compared to a net income of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase of $12.1 million in noninterest expense, mainly due to a $9.9 million ($7.8 million, net of tax effect) loss incurred from the termination of the Company's Defined Benefit Plan, and a decrease of $255,000 in non-interest income offset by an increase of $2.5 million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses and a decrease of $2.0 million in provision for income taxes. Excluding the one-time charge, the Company would have reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.16 per share.\nInterest Income. Interest and dividend income increased $4.3 million, or 9.4%, to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $4.4 million, or 9.7%, increase in interest income on loans, which is our primary source of interest income, offset by a decrease of $0.1 million of other interest and dividend income. Average loan balances increased $79.1 million, or 9.0%, to $946.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $867.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in average loan balances was mainly driven by increases in the multifamily residential, nonresidential, one-to-four family residential, and construction and land mortgage loan portfolios. The average yield on loans increased 3 basis point to 5.21% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nInterest income on deposits due from banks and available-for-sale securities and dividend income from FHLBNY stock remained unchanged at $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The average balance of deposits due from banks, available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock decreased $9.1 million, or 13.1%, to $60.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $69.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average rate earned on deposits due from banks, available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock increased 23 basis points to 1.97% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 1.74% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $2.9 million, or 30.2%, to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $1.8 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $701,000 for the same period in 2018. The average balance of money market accounts increased $64.6 million to $124.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $60.1 million for the same period last year, while the average rate paid on money market accounts increased 87 basis points to 2.04% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 1.17% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense on certificates of deposit remained essentially unchanged at $7.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The average balance on certificates of deposit decreased $36.7 million, or 8.4%, to $403.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $439.7 million for the same period last year, and the average rate the Bank paid on certificates of deposit increased 17 basis points to 1.90% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 1.73% for the same period in 2018.\nInterest expense on borrowings increased $955,000, or 106.2%, to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $899,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average balance on borrowings increased $42.7 million, or 122.5%, to $77.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $34.9 million for the same period last year, and the average rate the Bank paid on borrowings decreased 19 basis points to 2.39% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 2.58% for the same period in 2018.\nIncreased funding costs were primarily driven by management's efforts to retain high balance customers in higher yielding liquid deposits and higher market interest rates being offered by the Bank's competitors, combined with a resulting shift towards alternative funding during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $1.5 million, or 4.0%, to $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of organic loan growth offset by higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Average net interest-earning assets increased by $5.1 million, or 2.1%, to $245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $240.3 million for the same period in 2018, due primarily to increases of $64.6 million in average money market accounts and $42.7 million in borrowings offset by a decrease of $36.7 million in certificates of deposit and an increase of $79.1 million in loans. The net interest rate spread decreased by 17 basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 3.57% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the net interest margin was 3.79% and 3.92% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The compression on the net interest margin was primarily caused by organic loan growth being offset by higher market interest rates due to increased competition for deposits and increased funding costs attributed to increased alternative funding.\nManagement continued in 2019 to deploy various asset and liability management strategies to manage the Bank's risk of interest rate fluctuations. Net interest margin decrease 13 basis points in 2019, reflecting that pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors remained very competitive. The Federal Reserve Board reduced the federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points on each of July 31, September 18, and October 30, 2019. Further, on March 3, 2020, and March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board, in emergency actions, decreased the targeted federal funds rate by an aggregate of 150 basis points. These rate cuts were in response to severe market turmoil. As a result of these rate cuts and in the event that short-term interest rates were to be cut further in 2020 or beyond, the Bank's net interest margin will likely be negatively impacted as management's ability to lower funding costs on interest-bearing deposits would more than likely not exceed the pace with which these cuts would impact the Bank's yields on its earning assets. Although it could be anticipated that the Bank's net interest margin may continue to decrease in 2020, we believe net interest income should continue to increase compared to 2019 primarily due to increased average earning asset volumes, primarily loans. Management will continue to seek to fund these increased loan volumes by growing its core deposits, but will utilize funding alternatives, as needed.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish ALLL that, in management's opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans.\nIn evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management's ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic and market conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See -Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Business-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d for additional information.\nAfter an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $258,000 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTo the best of management's knowledge, the Bank recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonably expected. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to the Bank's loan portfolio, could result in material increases in the Bank's provision for loan losses. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews the Bank's allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, the Bank may determine to adjust the allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is management's responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. The Bank has selected a CECL model and has begun assessing plausible scenarios. The extent of the change to ALLL is indeterminable at this time as it will be dependent upon the portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date, as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. The Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with this new accounting standard. Assuming it remains a smaller reporting company, the Company will adopt the CECL standard for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. See Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the CECL standard.\nNon-interest Income. Total non-interest income decreased $255,000, or 8.7%, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to decreases of $530,000 in brokerage commissions and other non-interest income offset by increases of $275,000 in late and prepayment charges and service charges and fees.\n\nNon-interest Expense. Total non-interest expense increased $12.1 million, or 34.9%, to $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $12.1 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, is primarily attributable to a one-time charge of $9.9 million for the termination of the Defined Benefit Plan, of which $7.8 million was previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a $2.1 million charge-off related to the deferred tax asset associated with the Defined Benefit Plan, an increase of $944,000 in compensation and benefits expense largely as a result of expenses related to restricted stock units and stock options and an increase of $939,000 in occupancy and equipment expense due to the rebranding and branch network renovation initiatives. Other contributing factors were a $208,000 increase in other operating expenses as a result of increases in recruiting fees of $112,000 and $55,000 in expenses related to the repurchase of common shares, a $168,000 increase in data processing expenses as a result of system enhancements and implementation charges related to software upgrades and additional product offerings, a $83,000 increase in professional fees associated with public reporting requirements and a $45,000 increase in insurance and surety bond premium expense. The increase in non-interest expense was partially offset by decreases of $96,000 for direct loan expense, $124,000 for office supplies, telephone and postage and $57,000 for marketing and promotional expenses.\n\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company incurred an income tax benefit of ($924,000) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1.1 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in effective tax rates of 15.3% and 29.5%, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, net deferred tax assets amounted to $3.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\nGeneral. Consolidated net income increased $7.1 million, or 161.0%, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net loss of ($4.4 million) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.9 million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses and by decreases of $2.0 million in non-interest expense offset by a decrease of $166,000 in non-interest income.\nInterest Income. Interest and dividend income increased $7.2 million, or 18.4%, to $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $6.8 million, or 17.8%, increase in interest income on loans, which is our primary source of interest income. Average loan balances increased $131.5 million, or 17.9%, to $867.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $735.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in average loan balances was mainly driven by increases in the multifamily residential mortgage, nonresidential mortgage, one-to-four family residential mortgage, and construction and land loan portfolios. The average yield on loans decreased 1 basis point to 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 5.19% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nInterest and dividend income on deposits due from banks, available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock increased $391,000, or 47.9%, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $817,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The yield on deposits due from banks, available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock increased 42 basis points to 1.74% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 1.33% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average balance of deposits due from banks, available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock increased $3.8 million, or 5.8%, to $69.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $2.7 million, or 39.9%, to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was the result of an overall increase in interest expense on certificates of deposit, savings, money markets, NOW/IOLA and borrowings. Specifically, interest expense on certificates of deposit increased $1.7 million, or 28.7%, to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase resulted from increases in both the average balance of certificates of deposit and the average rate we paid on certificates of deposit. The average balance of certificates of deposit increased $52.5 million, or 13.6%, to $439.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $387.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the average rate we paid on certificates of deposit increased 20 basis points to 1.73% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest expense on savings, money markets, NOW/IOLA and borrowings increased $1.0 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $866,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase resulted from an increase in the average rate we paid on other deposits and borrowings. The average balance of savings, money markets, savings, NOW/IOLA and borrowings increased $28.6 million, or 12.8%, to $256.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $227.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the average rate we paid on savings, money markets, savings, NOW/IOLA and borrowings increased 33 basis points to 0.73% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 0.40% for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting higher market interest rates.\n\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $4.5 million, or 13.8%, to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of higher market yields on earning assets. Our average net interest-earning assets increased by $53.8 million, or 28.9%, to $240.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to our loan growth, described above. Our net interest rate spread decreased by 19 basis points, to 3.57%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our net interest margin was 3.92% and 4.02% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nA material change in interest rates will present us with a challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income if interest rates were to increase. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations. We expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would decrease as a result of a significant increase in interest rates. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may favorably affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have a favorable effect on our results of operations. We expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would increase as a result of a significant decrease in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we are promoting core deposit products while concurrently diversifying our loan portfolio by introducing new lending programs.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provision for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management's ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See -Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Business-Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional information.\nAfter an evaluation of these factors, the Bank decreased the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $467,000, or 27.2%, to $1.2 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $12.7 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $11.1 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses to gross loans decreased to 1.36% at December 31, 2018 from 1.37% at December 31, 2017, and the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans increased to 186.77% at December 31, 2018 from 97.05% at December 31, 2017.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2018. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for loan losses. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, we may determine to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.\nNon-interest Income. Total non-interest income decreased $166,000, or 5.3%, to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a decrease of $204,000 in late and prepayment charges.\n\nNon-interest Expense. Total non-interest expense decreased $2.0 million, or 5.5%, to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, compensation and employee benefits expense increased by $830,000 mainly due to our investment in our employee base, including the senior management team and our sales and relationship management personnel, to help support our continued growth strategy. Occupancy expense increased $848,000, due to the rebranding and improvements of our branches. Professional fees, which primarily include legal and audit expenses, increased $2.1 million. Other operating expenses increased $357,000. Office supplies, telephone and postage increased $206,000. In addition, there was an increase $100,000 in insurance and surety bond expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018. Direct loan expense increased $49,000. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6.3 million, which resulted from the absence of the contribution of 609,279 shares of Company common stock, valued at $6.1 million, and $200,000 in cash to the Ponce De Leon Foundation in 2017. In addition, data processing expenses, decreased by $62,000 mainly due to contractual provisions and the level of new products and services that were introduced during 2018.\n \n\nIncome Tax Expense. We incurred income tax expense of $1.1 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 29.5% and 48.1%, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, net deferred tax assets amounted to $3.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively.\nAverage Balance Sheet\nThe following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. All average balances are monthly average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.\n\n (1) Includes a loan held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no loans held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2018. \n (2) Includes FHLBNY demand account and FHLBNY stock dividends. \n (3) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities. \n (4) Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities. \n (5) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. \nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on the Bank's net interest income for the periods indicated. The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.\n\n (1) Includes a loan held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no loans held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2018. \nManagement of Market Risk\nGeneral. The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of the Bank's operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank's Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank's assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the Bank's business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis to evaluate the sensitivity to changing interest rates, based on the foregoing considerations.\nThe Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.\nNet Interest Income Simulation Models. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank's earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's level interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated:\n\n (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. \nAlthough an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates.\nThe behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios.\nAt December 31, 2019, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy.\nEconomic Value of Equity Model. While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model ( EVE\u201d) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At December 31, 2019, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates:\n\n (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. \n (2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. \n (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. \n (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. \nAlthough an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account\nfactors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2019, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy.\nMost Likely Earnings Simulation Models. Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as based thereon, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies.\nManagement's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank's regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software and external professionals to help ensure that the implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended and in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank's historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank's asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks.\nThe Asset/Liability Committee may determine that the Bank should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The Federal Reserve Board decreased the targeted federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points in each of July 2019, September 2019 and October 2019. On March 3, 2020, and March 15, 2020 the Federal Reserve Board, in emergency actions, decrease this targeted federal funds rate by an aggregate of 150 basis points. These rate cuts were in response to unprecedented market turmoil. We cannot make any representation as to whether, or how many times, the Federal Reserve Board will decrease or increase the targeted federal funds rate in the future.\nGAP Analysis. In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank's interest rate sensitivity \"gap.\" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of our interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of our interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2019, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.\n\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2018, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.\n\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and economic value tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table.\nInterest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Bank's customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sales securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $104.4 million and $44.4 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through a standby letter of credit of $3.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019, there was eligible collateral of approximately $301.8 million in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has an unsecured line of credit of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which there was $0 and $25.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAlthough maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and available-for-sale securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, offset by principal collections on loans, purchases of available-for-sale securities, proceeds from maturing of available-for-sale securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed available-for-sale securities, was $(38.7 million) and $(126.6 million) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in deposit accounts and advances, was $(8.5 million) and $128.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Bank is committed to maintaining an adequate liquidity position. The liquidity position is monitored on a daily basis and it is anticipated that there will be sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, it is anticipated that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change the Company's and the Bank's well capitalized category.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, the Bank routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Bank's future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans, commitments under lines of credit, and standby letters of credit totaling $96.1 million and $104.5 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Bank will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2019 total $217.2 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Bank may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of its operations, the Bank enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2019:\n \n\n \n (1) Amounts are for data processing services, leases of equipment and service implementation. \nThe obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of settlement, if any.",

    "summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- The company has made investments in recent years to expand, resulting in increased expenses but also significant loan portfolio growth, improved asset quality, and strengthened capital. \n- Abrupt interest rate changes present a challenge in managing interest rate risk. Increases in rates could adversely affect net interest income and net economic value.\n\nBusiness Strategy\n- Continue expanding multifamily and nonresidential loans using capital raised from 2017 stock offering. \n- Expand community lending programs as an SBA lender and CDFI.  \n- Increase core deposits, emphasize commercial demand deposits, and add non-core funding sources.\n- Manage credit risk to maintain low non-performing assets.\n- Expand employee base to support growth.\n- Pursue organic and opportunistic growth, including through acquisitions.\n\nFinancial Condition\n- Total assets remained at $1.1 billion from 2018 to 2019. \n- Cash and cash equivalents decreased due to loan growth, securities purchases, share repurchases, and deposit outflows. This was offset by increased FHLBNY advances and paydowns of loans held for sale.\n- Loans grew by $36.3 million or 3.9%, driven by commercial real estate and construction lending.  \n- Deposits decreased by $27.7 million or 3.4%, but lower cost core deposits increased.\n- Borrowings increased $35 million due to new FHLBNY advances.\n\nOperating Results\n- 2019 net loss of $5.1 million compared to 2018 net income of $2.7 million, primarily due to a one-time $9.9 million pension plan termination charge.\n- Net interest income increased due to loan growth, offset by higher funding costs. Margin compression resulted from increased competition and shift toward non-core funding. \n- Provision for loan losses decreased as asset quality improved.\n- Non-interest income decreased slightly.\n- Non-interest expense increased, mainly due to the pension plan charge.\n\nLiquidity and Capital \n- Liquidity remains sufficient to meet current obligations.\n- Regulatory capital ratios continue to exceed well capitalized levels.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the report summary!"
