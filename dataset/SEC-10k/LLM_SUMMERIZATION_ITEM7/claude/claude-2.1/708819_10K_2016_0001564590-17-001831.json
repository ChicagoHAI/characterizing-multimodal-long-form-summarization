Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Items 1 and 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.\nGeneral\nMDR is a leading provider of integrated engineering, procurement, construction and installation ( EPCI\u201d), front-end engineering and design ( FEED\u201d), and module fabrication services for upstream field developments worldwide. We deliver fixed and floating production facilities, pipeline installations and subsea systems from concept to commissioning for complex offshore and subsea oil and gas projects. Operating in approximately 20 countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, our integrated resources include a diversified fleet of marine vessels, fabrication facilities and engineering offices. We support our activities with comprehensive project management and procurement services, while utilizing our fully integrated capabilities in both shallow water and deepwater construction.\nWe report financial results under three reporting segments consisting of (1) the Americas, Europe and Africa ( AEA\u201d), (2) the Middle East ( MEA\u201d) and (3) Asia ( ASA\u201d). We also report certain corporate and other non-operating activities under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d Corporate and other primarily reflects costs that are not allocated to our operating segments. For financial information about our segments, see Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business activity depends mainly on capital expenditures for offshore construction services of major integrated oil and gas companies and national oil companies for the construction of development projects in the regions in which we operate. Our operations are generally capital intensive and rely on large contracts, which can account for a substantial amount of our revenues.\nOverview\nOur performance is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. Some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices, global oil supply, the world economy, the availability of credit, government regulation and global stability. Under the current macro commodity environment, we have seen continued pressure from customer capital expenditure spending delays, stronger competitive pricing pressure given contraction in certain markets, and lower utilization of our assets. However, we believe our long-term industry position remains favorable, and we will continue to maintain our focus on opportunities, customer alignment, efficient execution of our backlog, efficient asset utilization, and costs control and liquidity management. We will also continue positioning ourselves for growth when the global oil and gas industry rebounds and the producers increase their capital spending.\nOperating Results\n2016-We have a strong foundation for 2017. Our backlog at December 31, 2016 was $4.3 billion. Approximately $3 billion of this backlog is expected to roll-off in 2017. Significant new awards under the second Saudi Aramco Long Term Agreement ( LTA II\u201d), two other significant awards, with one in our AEA segment and one in our ASA segment, and a number of change orders contributed to our backlog increase.\nRevenues decreased by $434 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower activity on our Ichthys project and completion of the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project in our ASA segment. That decrease was partially offset by increased activities on several of our MEA segment projects.\nOperating income increased by $29 million from $113 million in 2015 to $142 million in 2016 despite the challenging environment of low crude oil and natural gas prices. We believe our performance indicates our capability to deliver strong results under a wide range of operating environments due to strong project execution and cost management driven by the One McDermott Way\u201d Initiative.\nThe 2016 period operating income was positively impacted by:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful completion of the 12 jacket Saudi Aramco project and a large Middle East pipeline-related project;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> progress on a lump sum EPCI project under the LTA II, and efficient execution and related cost saving on the Marjan power systems replacement project, both Saudi Aramco projects; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> close-out improvements, favorable changes in estimates and recognition of approved change orders on active and closed projects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2016 period operating income was negatively impacted by $31 million resulting from a failure identified in certain supplier provided subsea-pipe connector components previously installed on the Ichthys project in Australia, as discussed in Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA total of $55 million of non-cash impairment charges related to our Agile vessel and certain other marine assets impacted our 2016 operating income, as discussed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurement, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2016 we realized approximately $150 million and $46 million of cash savings, before restructuring charges, from our McDermott Profitability Initiative ( MPI\u201d) and Additional Overhead Reduction program ( AOR\u201d), respectively. MPI was completed during the third quarter of 2016 and AOR was completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n2015-Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 was $4.2 billion. A significant award under the LTA II, two key awards in Qatar and a number of change orders contributed to $3.7 billion of backlog increase, partially offset by $3 billion of revenue roll-off during 2015, resulting in a net increase of approximately $631 million over our backlog as of December 31, 2014.\nRevenues for 2015 were approximately $3 billion, an increase of $769 million, or 33%, over 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> progress, driven by marine activities, on the Ichthys project;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> completion of the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a significant increase in activities associated with several of our Middle East projects; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increased fabrication and marine activities on the PB Litoral project.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income was $113 million in 2015, an increase of $96 million compared to 2014.

In addition, we continued our efforts to improve our cost structure and commenced AOR during the fourth quarter of 2015.\n2014-Operating income of $16 million included favorable changes in estimates of $111 million due to:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> project closeout benefits and reimbursement for weather downtime and vessel standby time, for further discussion see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a gain of $46 million associated with the sale of non-core assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an improvement of $11 million related to a change in estimate of vessel-impairment charges recognized in 2013 for the CSV 108 pipelay system, for further discussion see Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThose increases were partially offset by $110 million of increased costs to complete certain projects, primarily due to marine equipment downtime driven by adverse weather conditions, mechanical issues and standby delays and accrual for liquidated damages (see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, we incurred a charge in the amount of $18 million associated with our ongoing restructuring programs, as discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe demand for our services is affected by the capital expenditure decisions of oil and gas producers. Material declines in oil and natural gas prices have affected, and will likely continue to affect, the demand for and pricing of our EPCI services. Many of our customers make their capital expenditure decisions based on their long-term view of oil and gas prices and the economics of specific projects. We operate in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world, work on both new and existing field developments and provide services that require a varying amount of technical complexity. As a result, the economics of specific projects that we provide services for varies considerably.\nThe sustained relatively lower-oil-price environment since 2014 and the slowdown of growth in certain developing countries has raised uncertainty around the economics of certain potential projects that have not yet been approved or awarded by our customers. We do not currently have any reason to expect cancellation of existing projects in our backlog. Nonetheless, the continued relatively depressed price of oil has adversely affected demand for our services and could, over a sustained period of time, materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince the start of the most recent substantial decline in the price of oil, many oil and gas companies made significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets for 2015 and 2016. Though some of our customers have reduced their current levels of spending on exploration, development and production programs, including by deferring or delaying certain capital projects, we do expect other capital projects to continue, as they are economic or strategically necessary in a variety of oil and gas price environments. We also expect that project deferrals and delays, combined with the natural decline rates of existing production and the resetting of the industry cost base, will ultimately contribute to further investment by oil and gas producers in the long-term.\nIn the current environment, we will continue to maintain our focus on opportunities, customer alignment, efficient execution of our backlog, efficient asset utilization and cost and liquidity management. We will also continue positioning ourselves for growth when the global oil and gas industry rebounds and the producers increase their capital spending.\nSegment Operations\n2016 Versus 2015\nRevenues\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AEA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 285,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (192,812\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,241,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,134,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,108,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,456,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (348,516\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,635,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,070,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (434,292\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues decreased by 14%, or $434 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in our AEA and ASA segments, partially offset by an increase in our MEA segment.\nAEA-Revenues decreased by 40%, or $193 million, due to a reduction in active projects in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenues, as follows:\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> completion of jacket fabrication activity at our Altamira facility in Mexico and its installation campaign undertaken by the DB 50 vessel on the Ayatsil-C jacket replacement project;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> transportation, installation and marine campaigns executed by the DB 50 and NO 105 vessels on the EOG Sercan project in Trinidad;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hookup and commissioning activities associated with the PB Litoral project in Mexico, which was completed in the first half of 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fabrication, spooling and installation of jumpers and control umbilicals on the Jack St. Malo project in the Gulf of Mexico, which was completed in the third quarter of 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commencement of engineering work on the Abkatun-A2 platform project, a turnkey EPCI contract in the Gulf of Mexico awarded in 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> umbilical and flowline installation marine campaigns by the North Ocean 102 ( NO 102\u201d) and NO 105 vessels for the Caesar Tonga field development project in the Gulf of Mexico;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> completion of the LLOG Otis subsea tieback project in the Gulf of Mexico;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> marine campaigns executed by the DB 50 vessel on the Exxon Julia subsea tieback project in the Gulf of Mexico, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016;

While we expect change orders, close-outs and settlements to continue as part of our normal business activities, the period in which they are recognized is largely driven by the finalization of agreements with customers and suppliers and, as a result, is difficult to predict. Additionally, the future margin increases or decreases associated with these items are difficult to predict, due to, among other items, the difficulty of predicting the timing of recognition of change orders, close-outs and settlements and the timing of new project awards.\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AEA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,829\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,487\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,342\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (121)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,028\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,261\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,749\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income improved by $30 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to improvements in our MEA segment.\nAEA-Operating losses were $30 million and $13 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2016, the operating results were negatively impacted by:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a $43 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Agile vessel and Intermac 600 cargo barge, as discussed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurement, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements;

See Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this change.\nASA-Operating income in 2016 and 2015 was $9 million and $31 million, respectively.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating income, as follows:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> improved productivity and project execution cost savings and recognition of approved change orders on active projects; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> close-out improvements on our completed projects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2016 period operating income was negatively impacted by $31 million resulting from a failure identified in certain supplier provided subsea-pipe connector components previously installed on the Ichthys project in Australia, as discussed in Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe 2016 and 2015 operating income included charges of $5 million and $20 million, respectively, related to restructuring, as discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditionally, in connection with a review of our long-lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2016, we determined that the carrying values of certain marine assets were not recoverable and exceeded their respective fair values. As a result, we recorded a $12 million non-cash impairment charge in our ASA segment. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating income in 2015 also included a $4 million impairment related to the DB 101 vessel and a $3 million loss on disposal of an asset, neither of which was repeated in 2016.\nOther Items in Operating Income\nCorporate and other expenses of $3 million and $13 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily relate to restructuring charges. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d)-SG&A was $179 million and $217 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We continue our efforts to improve our cost structure, and the implementation of both our MPI and AOR programs contributed to lower SG&A expense in 2016 compared to 2015. As of December 31, 2016, both the MPI and AOR programs are complete.\nOther Non-operating Items\nInterest expense, net-Interest expense, net was $59 million and $50 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Increase in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest capitalization in 2016 compared to 2015. The DLV 2000 vessel, which was under construction in 2015, was deployed to our fleet in the second quarter of 2016. Interest expense for both periods is associated with our long-term debt obligations discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProvision for Income Taxes-For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized income before provision for income taxes of $82 million, compared to income before provision for income taxes of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the aggregate, the provision for income taxes was $42 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily driven by increased mix of income in favorable tax jurisdictions, which was partially offset by losses in certain jurisdictions where we did not recognize a tax benefit. In addition, due to our improving operations, we were able to release the remaining $9 million valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset related to the Saudi Arabia net operating loss as well as partially release $4 million valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset related to the Mexico net operating loss as a result of current contracts in our backlog. Our effective tax rate decreased from 80% in 2015 to 51% in 2016.\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates-The loss from investments in our unconsolidated affiliates was $4 million and $21 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in losses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was primarily attributable to improved operating results of our China joint venture.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest-Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million and $9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $7 million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a loss incurred by Berlian McDermott Sdn. Bhd ( BMD\u201d), our former Malaysian joint venture and lower profitability in our Indonesian joint venture during 2016. In the third quarter of 2016, we acquired the BMD noncontrolling interest, as discussed in Note 17, Stockholders' Equity, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 Versus 2014\nRevenues\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AEA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 567,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (88,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,134,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 795,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 338,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,456,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 937,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 519,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,070,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,300,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 769,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues were $3,070 million and $2,301 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of approximately 33%, or $769 million, primarily due to increased activity in our ASA and MEA segments, partially offset by decreased activity in our AEA segment.\nAEA-Revenues decreased by 16%, or $89 million, in 2015 compared to 2014.

In the second quarter of 2015, we disposed of the asset and recognized an additional loss of $3 million. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Items in Operating Income\nCorporate and other expenses increased to $13 million in 2015 compared to $9 million in 2014, primarily as a result of restructuring charges. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a fourth quarter non-cash MTM pension charge of $26 million, partially offset by cost savings realized by MPI.\nGain (loss) on disposal of asset for 2014 primarily related to the following sales and disposals: (1) sale of the DB 16 and the KP1, resulting in a $11 million gain; (2) a gain from the sale of our Harbor Island facility near Corpus Christi, Texas of approximately $25 million; and (3) an aggregate gain of approximately $10 million from the disposal of various assets from our Morgan City facility.\nOther Non-operating Items\nInterest expense, net was $50 million in 2015 and $61 million in 2014. The 2015 interest expense was lower compared to 2014 primarily due to a one-time $28 million interest charge for unamortized issuance fees in the second quarter of 2014 related to the termination of bridge financing arrangements with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. Interest expense for 2015 includes full-year interest on all of our long-term debt obligations issued in April 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes-For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized income before provision for income taxes of $65 million, compared to a loss before provision for income taxes of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The provision for income taxes was $52 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily driven by increased profits in certain jurisdictions in which we operate (primarily Saudi Arabia and Australia). In addition, we were able to utilize past losses in certain jurisdictions which were previously un-benefited to offset our improving income (primarily Saudi Arabia and Singapore).\nOur effective tax rate for 2015 and 2014 was 80% and (54)%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily driven by increased profits in certain jurisdictions in which we operate (mainly Saudi Arabia and Australia), a valuation allowance against losses in tax jurisdictions where we do not expect to receive a tax benefit, and taxes on unremitted earnings in jurisdictions where we do not have plans to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. This resulted in an increase in our overall effective tax rate. See Note 15, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the rate reconciliation table.\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased by $14 million from an $8 million loss in 2014 to a $22 million loss in 2015, primarily due to increased operating losses on the joint ventures Qingdao McDermott Wuchuan Offshore, io Oil & Gas and THHE Fabricators Sdn. Bhd.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest-Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $9 million and $11 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to our acquisition of our partner's interest in our North Ocean joint venture related to the NO 102, partially offset by increased income from two of our consolidated affiliates.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), generally using historical U.S. dollar accounting ( historical cost\u201d). Statements based on historical cost, however, do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar, especially during times of significant and continued inflation.\nIn order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations, we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor, material and service costs either through an estimate of those changes, which we reflect in the original price, or through price escalation clauses in our contracts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary ongoing sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand. We regularly review our sources and uses of funds and may access capital markets to increase our liquidity position or to refinance our existing debt. We plan to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements with cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, or a combination thereof.\nManagement believes, based on our current financial condition and existing and expected backlog, that our cash flows from operations and the sources of liquidity and capital resources described below will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $612 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash compared to $782 million as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, we had $75 million of cash in jurisdictions outside the U.S., principally in Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico and Qatar. Approximately 4% of our outstanding cash balance is held in countries that have established government imposed currency restrictions that could impede the ability of our subsidiary to transfer funds to us.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $16 million, compared to $117 million as of December 31, 2015. The amounts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 include $16 million and $102 million, respectively, of cash collateral for letters of credit that generally may be replaced with letters of credit under the LC Facility.\nCash Flow Activities\nOperating activities-Net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $178 million, $55 million and $7 million, respectively.\nThe cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected our net income (loss), adjusted for non-cash items and changes in components of our working capital-accounts receivable, contracts in progress net of advance billings on contracts, and accounts payable. Fluctuations in working capital are normal in our business. Working capital is impacted by the size of our projects and the achievement of billing milestones on backlog as we complete certain phases of the project.\nWe believe our anticipated future operating cash flow, capacity under our credit facilities and uncommitted bilateral lines of credit, along with access to surety bonds will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, settle our commitments and contingencies and address our working capital needs in the foreseeable future.\nIn the first half of 2015, we reached agreements with a representative we previously utilized in our Middle East operations and certain of its affiliates and associates regarding: (1) the value and timing of payment of ongoing future amounts that were to be paid under a representation agreement that we elected to allow to expire, with respect to: (a) commissions on customer contracts that we had entered into prior to such expiration; and (b) future commissions payable on customer contracts we expected to enter into during a specified post-expiration period under the representation agreement (pursuant to provisions that provided for commissions to be payable on customer contracts entered into during such post-expiration period); and (2) our repurchase of shares of capital stock in one of our subsidiaries previously held by them. Under these agreements, we agreed to make a series of payments in respect of the commissions that were expected to become due and payable under the prior arrangement. We paid approximately $21 million in March 2015, $26 million in April 2015 and $4 million in the second half of 2015 in connection with these agreements.\nInvesting activities-Our net cash used in investing activities was $231 million, $96 million and $245 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash used in 2016 primarily related to the construction of the Deepwater Lay Vessel 2000 ( DLV 2000\u201d), and was incurred as a result of the construction work reaching established milestones, including completion in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe change in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures. A lower level of capital spending in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the delay in completion of our DLV 2000, resulting from deferrals of milestone payments, and lower payments in 2015 for our CSV 108 vessel, which was completed and put in service in the first quarter of 2015.\nProceeds from disposition of assets provided cash of $2 million, $11 million and $72 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFinancing activities-Our net cash used in financing activities was $116 million and $28 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was $951 million.\nNet cash used in 2016 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of $75 million under the Term Loan discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, and $16 million and $8 million of repayments related to the Amortizing Notes comprising part of TEUs described below under Credit Agreement and Debt\u201d and NO 105 construction financing, respectively.\nNet cash used in 2015 was primarily attributable to $15 million and $8 million of repayments related to the Amortizing Notes and NO 105 construction financing, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was primarily attributable to the financing transactions completed in April 2014, as discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash provided was partially offset by:\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our exercise, in October 2014, of our option to purchase the interest of our joint venture partner, Oceanteam Shipping ASA, in the NO 102 vessel-owning entities, at a net cost of approximately $33 million.

We also completed the issuance of (a) $500 million of second-lien, seven-year, senior secured notes; and (b) $288 million of tangible equity units ( TEUs\u201d) composed of (1) three-year amortizing, senior unsecured notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $48 million, and (2) prepaid common stock purchase contracts.\nIn October 2015, we entered into an amendment which amended the Credit Agreement primarily to increase the existing LC Facility from $400 million to $520 million.\nIn February 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit us to add to Covenant EBITDA certain cash restructuring expenses related to the conclusion of MPI or implementation of AOR for the quarters ending on or after March 31, 2016 but before April 16, 2017, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million (as of any date of determination).\nOn April 18, 2016, we entered into another amendment to the Credit Agreement, which, among other things:\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> replaced the existing EBITDA covenant with new ratios as follows:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 1.15x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each fiscal quarter thereafter;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 4.5x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each subsequent fiscal quarter through June 30, 2017, 4.0x for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, and 3.5x for each fiscal quarter thereafter; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a maximum secured leverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 2.0x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each subsequent fiscal quarter through December 31, 2017, and 1.5x for each fiscal quarter thereafter;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> amended the maximum capital expenditure covenant to limit capital expenditures in 2016 and thereafter to $250 million each fiscal year, with any prior fiscal year unused capital expenditures up to $125 million able to be carried forward and added to the next year's capital expenditure capacity, for a total of $375 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> extended the maturity date of the LC Facility commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changed the existing letter of credit capacity to $450 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> extended the deadline for mortgaging the DLV 2000 to one year after taking delivery thereof, and gave McDermott the option to consider potential financing options for the DLV 2000 during that period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increased the basket for purchase money indebtedness to $150 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> modified the covenant limiting acquisitions to permit up to $150 million of acquisitions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> modified the covenant limiting the prepayment or purchase of junior priority debt to permit up to $100 million of such prepayments or purchases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn May 12, 2016, we entered into a further amendment to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, increased the applicable margin payable on the Term Loan by 3.0% per annum and requires that the net cash proceeds of any sale (including a sale and leaseback) of the DLV 2000 be applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loan.\nOn May 13, 2016, we prepaid $75 million of the Term Loan and satisfied the other conditions to the effective date\u201d set forth in the last amendment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, as shown below:\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td> Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.15x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.36x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum total leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.36x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum secured leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.73x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCalculation of ratios under the Credit Agreement, as amended, requires us to compute consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted ( Covenant EBITDA\u201d).

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report.\nUse of Estimates-We use estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and variances could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Changes in project estimates generally exclude change orders and changes in scope, but may include, without limitation, unexpected changes in weather conditions, productivity, unanticipated vessel repair requirements, customer, subcontractor and supplier delays and other costs. We generally expect to experience a variety of unanticipated events, and some of these events can result in significant cost increases above cost amounts we previously estimated. As of December 31, 2016, we have provided for our estimated costs to complete on all of our ongoing contracts. However, it is possible that current estimates could change due to unforeseen events, which could result in adjustments to overall contract costs. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in material adjustments to operating results. See Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition-We generally recognize contract revenues and related costs on a percentage-of-completion method for individual contracts or combinations of contracts based on work performed, man hours, or a cost-to-cost method, as applicable to the activity involved.\nAt the outset of each project, we prepare a detailed analysis of our estimated cost to complete the project. Total estimated project costs, and resulting contract income, are affected by changes in the expected cost of materials and labor, productivity, vessel costs, scheduling and other factors. In order to record revenue and profits on these projects, we multiply the total estimated profit over the life of the project by the current percentage towards completion based on the appropriate units noted above. Estimated losses on a project are recorded in full in the period the loss becomes known.\nEstimated profit over the life of a project includes consideration of contract price, change orders, claims, costs incurred and estimated costs to complete. Change orders, which are a normal and recurring part of our business, can increase (sometimes substantially) the future scope and cost of a job. Revenue from unapproved change orders is generally recognized to the extent of the lesser of amounts we expect to recover or costs incurred. To the extent claims included in backlog are not resolved in our favor, there could be reductions in, or reversals of previously reported amounts of, revenues and profits, and charges against current earnings, which could be material.\nWe regularly review contract price and cost estimates as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit, proportionate to the job percentage of completion in the period, when those estimates are revised. External factors such as weather, customer requirements, timely availability of materials, productivity, and other factors outside of our control may affect the progress and estimated cost of a project's completion which could materially impact the timing and amount of our revenue and income recognition. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nLoss Contingencies- We record liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. We provide disclosure when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision or if such loss is not reasonably estimable. We have accrued our estimates of the probable losses associated with these matters and associated legal costs are generally recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. However, our losses are typically resolved over long periods of time and are often difficult to estimate due to various factors, including the possibility of multiple actions by third parties. Therefore, it is possible future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates related to these matters.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans-We estimate income or expense related to our pension and postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial assumptions, including assumptions regarding discount rates and expected returns on plan assets adjusted for the current period actuarial gains and losses. We determine our discount rate based on a review of published financial data and discussions with our actuary regarding rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of our pension obligations. Based on historical data and discussions with our investment consultant, we determine our expected return on plan assets based on the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets and the market value of our plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the expected return of the various asset classes held in the plan, weighted by the target allocation of the plan's assets. Changes in these assumptions can result in significant changes in our estimated pension income or expense and our consolidated financial condition. We revise our assumptions annually based upon changes in current interest rates, return on plan assets and the underlying demographics of our workforce. These assumptions are reasonably likely to change in future periods and may have a material impact on future earnings.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for our pension plan.\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect on\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Pretax Pension\nExpense in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension Benefit\nObligation at\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 25-basis-point change in discount rate\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 25-basis-point change in expected long-term rate of return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information on our pension plans.\nImpairment-We review our tangible long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation is required, the fair value of each applicable asset is compared to its carrying value. Factors that impact our determination of potential impairment include forecasted utilization of equipment and estimates of forecasted cash flows from projects expected to be performed in future periods. Our estimates of cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions or changes in operating performance. Any changes in such factors may negatively affect our business segments and result in future asset impairments.\nDeferred Taxes-We believe that our deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2016 are realizable through carrybacks, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If we subsequently determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, the resulting adjustment would increase earnings for the period in which such determination was made. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Any changes to our estimated valuation allowance could be material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See Note 15, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our deferred taxes.\nAccounting and Reporting Changes\nFor a discussion of the potential impact of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStatements we make in the following discussion which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Items 1 and 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.\nGeneral\nMDR is a leading provider of integrated engineering, procurement, construction and installation ( EPCI\u201d), front-end engineering and design ( FEED\u201d), and module fabrication services for upstream field developments worldwide. We deliver fixed and floating production facilities, pipeline installations and subsea systems from concept to commissioning for complex offshore and subsea oil and gas projects. Operating in approximately 20 countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, our integrated resources include a diversified fleet of marine vessels, fabrication facilities and engineering offices. We support our activities with comprehensive project management and procurement services, while utilizing our fully integrated capabilities in both shallow water and deepwater construction.\nWe report financial results under three reporting segments consisting of (1) the Americas, Europe and Africa ( AEA\u201d), (2) the Middle East ( MEA\u201d) and (3) Asia ( ASA\u201d). We also report certain corporate and other non-operating activities under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d Corporate and other primarily reflects costs that are not allocated to our operating segments. For financial information about our segments, see Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business activity depends mainly on capital expenditures for offshore construction services of major integrated oil and gas companies and national oil companies for the construction of development projects in the regions in which we operate. Our operations are generally capital intensive and rely on large contracts, which can account for a substantial amount of our revenues.\nOverview\nOur performance is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. Some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices, global oil supply, the world economy, the availability of credit, government regulation and global stability. Under the current macro commodity environment, we have seen continued pressure from customer capital expenditure spending delays, stronger competitive pricing pressure given contraction in certain markets, and lower utilization of our assets. However, we believe our long-term industry position remains favorable, and we will continue to maintain our focus on opportunities, customer alignment, efficient execution of our backlog, efficient asset utilization, and costs control and liquidity management. We will also continue positioning ourselves for growth when the global oil and gas industry rebounds and the producers increase their capital spending.\nOperating Results\n2016-We have a strong foundation for 2017. Our backlog at December 31, 2016 was $4.3 billion. Approximately $3 billion of this backlog is expected to roll-off in 2017. Significant new awards under the second Saudi Aramco Long Term Agreement ( LTA II\u201d), two other significant awards, with one in our AEA segment and one in our ASA segment, and a number of change orders contributed to our backlog increase.\nRevenues decreased by $434 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower activity on our Ichthys project and completion of the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project in our ASA segment. That decrease was partially offset by increased activities on several of our MEA segment projects.\nOperating income increased by $29 million from $113 million in 2015 to $142 million in 2016 despite the challenging environment of low crude oil and natural gas prices. We believe our performance indicates our capability to deliver strong results under a wide range of operating environments due to strong project execution and cost management driven by the One McDermott Way\u201d Initiative.\nThe 2016 period operating income was positively impacted by:\n \u2022 successful completion of the 12 jacket Saudi Aramco project and a large Middle East pipeline-related project; \n \u2022 progress on a lump sum EPCI project under the LTA II, and efficient execution and related cost saving on the Marjan power systems replacement project, both Saudi Aramco projects; and \n \u2022 close-out improvements, favorable changes in estimates and recognition of approved change orders on active and closed projects. \nThe 2016 period operating income was negatively impacted by $31 million resulting from a failure identified in certain supplier provided subsea-pipe connector components previously installed on the Ichthys project in Australia, as discussed in Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA total of $55 million of non-cash impairment charges related to our Agile vessel and certain other marine assets impacted our 2016 operating income, as discussed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurement, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2016 we realized approximately $150 million and $46 million of cash savings, before restructuring charges, from our McDermott Profitability Initiative ( MPI\u201d) and Additional Overhead Reduction program ( AOR\u201d), respectively. MPI was completed during the third quarter of 2016 and AOR was completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n2015-Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 was $4.2 billion. A significant award under the LTA II, two key awards in Qatar and a number of change orders contributed to $3.7 billion of backlog increase, partially offset by $3 billion of revenue roll-off during 2015, resulting in a net increase of approximately $631 million over our backlog as of December 31, 2014.\nRevenues for 2015 were approximately $3 billion, an increase of $769 million, or 33%, over 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to:\n \u2022 progress, driven by marine activities, on the Ichthys project; \n \u2022 completion of the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project; \n \u2022 a significant increase in activities associated with several of our Middle East projects; and \n \u2022 increased fabrication and marine activities on the PB Litoral project. \nOperating income was $113 million in 2015, an increase of $96 million compared to 2014. Operating income was positively impacted by:\n \u2022 strong project execution, including on the Ichthys project, where the activities remained on schedule; \n \u2022 successful completion of the Manifa, Abu Ali and Karan 45 projects, all with Saudi Aramco; and \n \u2022 completion of fabrication, installation and hook up of the PB Litoral facilities. \nSignificant items we recognized as charges in our operating income included:\n \u2022 $41 million for the restructuring actions discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; \n \u2022 a $26 million non-cash mark-to-market ( MTM\u201d) actuarial loss on our pension benefit plans, discussed in Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; and \n \u2022 a $17 million charge associated with a legal settlement in the third quarter of 2015. \nDuring 2015, from our MPI program, we realized approximately $115 million of cash savings, before restructuring charges. In addition, we continued our efforts to improve our cost structure and commenced AOR during the fourth quarter of 2015.\n2014-Operating income of $16 million included favorable changes in estimates of $111 million due to:\n \u2022 project closeout benefits and reimbursement for weather downtime and vessel standby time, for further discussion see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; \n \u2022 a gain of $46 million associated with the sale of non-core assets; and \n \u2022 an improvement of $11 million related to a change in estimate of vessel-impairment charges recognized in 2013 for the CSV 108 pipelay system, for further discussion see Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThose increases were partially offset by $110 million of increased costs to complete certain projects, primarily due to marine equipment downtime driven by adverse weather conditions, mechanical issues and standby delays and accrual for liquidated damages (see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, we incurred a charge in the amount of $18 million associated with our ongoing restructuring programs, as discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe demand for our services is affected by the capital expenditure decisions of oil and gas producers. Material declines in oil and natural gas prices have affected, and will likely continue to affect, the demand for and pricing of our EPCI services. Many of our customers make their capital expenditure decisions based on their long-term view of oil and gas prices and the economics of specific projects. We operate in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world, work on both new and existing field developments and provide services that require a varying amount of technical complexity. As a result, the economics of specific projects that we provide services for varies considerably.\nThe sustained relatively lower-oil-price environment since 2014 and the slowdown of growth in certain developing countries has raised uncertainty around the economics of certain potential projects that have not yet been approved or awarded by our customers. We do not currently have any reason to expect cancellation of existing projects in our backlog. Nonetheless, the continued relatively depressed price of oil has adversely affected demand for our services and could, over a sustained period of time, materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince the start of the most recent substantial decline in the price of oil, many oil and gas companies made significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets for 2015 and 2016. Though some of our customers have reduced their current levels of spending on exploration, development and production programs, including by deferring or delaying certain capital projects, we do expect other capital projects to continue, as they are economic or strategically necessary in a variety of oil and gas price environments. We also expect that project deferrals and delays, combined with the natural decline rates of existing production and the resetting of the industry cost base, will ultimately contribute to further investment by oil and gas producers in the long-term.\nIn the current environment, we will continue to maintain our focus on opportunities, customer alignment, efficient execution of our backlog, efficient asset utilization and cost and liquidity management. We will also continue positioning ourselves for growth when the global oil and gas industry rebounds and the producers increase their capital spending.\nSegment Operations\n2016 Versus 2015\nRevenues\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AEA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 285,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (192,812\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,241,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,134,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,108,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,456,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (348,516\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,635,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,070,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (434,292\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues decreased by 14%, or $434 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in our AEA and ASA segments, partially offset by an increase in our MEA segment.\nAEA-Revenues decreased by 40%, or $193 million, due to a reduction in active projects in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenues, as follows:\n \u2022 completion of jacket fabrication activity at our Altamira facility in Mexico and its installation campaign undertaken by the DB 50 vessel on the Ayatsil-C jacket replacement project; \n \u2022 transportation, installation and marine campaigns executed by the DB 50 and NO 105 vessels on the EOG Sercan project in Trinidad; \n \u2022 hookup and commissioning activities associated with the PB Litoral project in Mexico, which was completed in the first half of 2016; \n \u2022 fabrication, spooling and installation of jumpers and control umbilicals on the Jack St. Malo project in the Gulf of Mexico, which was completed in the third quarter of 2016; \n \u2022 commencement of engineering work on the Abkatun-A2 platform project, a turnkey EPCI contract in the Gulf of Mexico awarded in 2016; \n \u2022 umbilical and flowline installation marine campaigns by the North Ocean 102 ( NO 102\u201d) and NO 105 vessels for the Caesar Tonga field development project in the Gulf of Mexico; \n \u2022 completion of the LLOG Otis subsea tieback project in the Gulf of Mexico; \n \u2022 marine campaigns executed by the DB 50 vessel on the Exxon Julia subsea tieback project in the Gulf of Mexico, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016; and \n \u2022 multiple front-end engineering and design projects. \nIn 2015, the following projects, which were complete or substantially complete in 2015, contributed to revenue:\n \u2022 NO 102, NO 105 and Agile vessel charter campaigns in Brazil; \n \u2022 completion of fabrication and installation activity on the PB Litoral project, as well as the reversal of a $12 million provision for liquidated damages due to an agreed extension of the PB Litoral project completion date; \n \u2022 marine campaigns executed by the DB 50 vessel, primarily on the Exxon Julia subsea tieback project, the Ayatsil-A project, a transportation and installation ( T&I\u201d) project, and a mobile drilling structure installation project; and \n \u2022 close-out improvements on our Papa Terra project. \nThe start-up of fabrication work on the Ayatsil-C jacket replacement project at our Altamira facility, awarded in 2015, also contributed to 2015 revenue.\nMEA-Revenues increased by 9%, or $107 million, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenues, as follows:\n \u2022 engineering, fabrication and marine activities on a lump-sum EPCI project under the LTA II entered into with Saudi Aramco; \n \u2022 continued fabrication and marine installation progress on the 12 jacket Saudi Aramco project, which was completed in 2016; \n \u2022 fabrication and marine cablelay activities on the Marjan Saudi Aramco power system replacement project; \n \u2022 commencement and substantial completion of a large pipeline-related project in the Middle East; \n \u2022 the marine campaign for installation of a pipeline, spool and risers on a flow assurance project in Qatar, awarded in the fourth quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 engineering, fabrication and marine activity on our KJO Hout project in the Neutral Zone; \n \u2022 commencement and substantial completion of offshore marine hookup campaign progress on a wellhead jacket and umbilical project in Qatar; and \n \u2022 the Qatar Petroleum EPCI project, which was completed in 2016. \nClose out improvements on the Safaniya phase 2 and ADMA 4 GI projects also contributed to 2016 revenue.\nIn 2015, activities on the following projects, which either were complete or were substantially complete in 2015, contributed to revenues:\n \u2022 the Safaniya phase 2, Manifa facilities, Karan 45 and Abu Ali Cables projects, each with Saudi Aramco; and \n \u2022 the ADMA 4 GI project in the U.A.E. \nCommencement in 2015 of a lump-sum EPCI project under the LTA II, the Marjan power system replacement project and the KJO Hout project also contributed to 2015 revenue.\nASA-Revenues decreased 24%, or $349 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced activity in 2016 on our Ichthys EPCI project in Australia, as the project progressed through to the marine transportation and installation phase.\nThose decreases were partially offset by the following projects:\n \u2022 higher fabrication activity in 2016 on the Yamal project awarded in the third quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 commencement in 2016 of the Vashishta subsea field infrastructure development work, an EPCI project in India; and \n \u2022 the Bergading offshore installation project in Malaysia, which was completed in the second quarter of 2016. \nIn 2015 the following projects, which were either complete or were substantially complete in 2015, contributed to revenue:\n \u2022 the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project; \n \u2022 the Gorgon MRU project; and \n \u2022 the Bukit-Tua platform/subsea spools installation project. \nOperating Income\nOperating income is frequently influenced by the resolution of change orders, project close-outs and settlements, which generally can cause operating margins to improve during the period in which these items are approved or finalized. While we expect change orders, close-outs and settlements to continue as part of our normal business activities, the period in which they are recognized is largely driven by the finalization of agreements with customers and suppliers and, as a result, is difficult to predict. Additionally, the future margin increases or decreases associated with these items are difficult to predict, due to, among other items, the difficulty of predicting the timing of recognition of change orders, close-outs and settlements and the timing of new project awards.\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AEA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,829\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,487\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,342\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (121)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,028\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,261\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,749\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income improved by $30 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to improvements in our MEA segment.\nAEA-Operating losses were $30 million and $13 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2016, the operating results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 a $43 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Agile vessel and Intermac 600 cargo barge, as discussed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurement, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; and \n \u2022 lower cost recovery associated with our fabrication facility at Altamira and our vessels due to a reduction in active projects. \nThose negative factors were partially offset by:\n \u2022 net favorable changes in estimates of approximately an additional $28 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 (see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements); \n \u2022 successful execution and close-out improvements on the PB Litoral, Jack St. Malo II and Exxon Julia subsea tieback projects; \n \u2022 productivity improvement and associated cost savings related to our DB 50 and NO 102 vessels' marine campaigns undertaken in the Gulf of Mexico; and \n \u2022 the reversal of a $7 million provision for liquidated damages due to an agreed extension of the PB Litoral project completion date. \nFurthermore, 2016 operating results were positively impacted by a $4 million non-cash MTM pension gain, as discussed in Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe 2015 operating results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 a $26 million non-cash MTM pension charge, as discussed in Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; \n \u2022 a $17 million legal settlement charge, which was not repeated in 2016; and \n \u2022 a $10 million restructuring charge, as discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThose negative factors were partially offset by:\n \u2022 marine charter activities undertaken by the NO 102, NO 105 and Agile vessels on various projects in Brazil; \n \u2022 the DB 50's marine campaigns on various projects in the Gulf of Mexico; \n \u2022 benefits as a result of a favorable outcome in our discussions with the customer on compensation for weather-related delays on the Papa Terra project; and \n \u2022 increased fabrication and marine activities on the PB Litoral project, as well as the reversal of a $12 million provision for liquidated damages due to an agreed extension of the PB Litoral project completion date. \nMEA-Operating income in 2016 and 2015 was $167 million and $108 million, respectively, an increase of $59 million year on year.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating income, as follows:\n \u2022 the completion in 2016 of jacket fabrication and marine installation activity coupled with close-out improvements on the 12 jacket Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 progress driven by higher engineering, fabrication and marine pipelay activity, as well as improved productivity and associated cost savings, on a lump sum EPCI project under the Saudi Aramco LTA II agreement; \n \u2022 increased engineering, marine cable lay activities, and award of a jacket change order, together with efficient execution and related cost saving on the Marjan power systems replacement, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 start and substantial completion of a large pipeline-related project in the Middle East; \n \u2022 marine installation activities undertaken by the DB 32 and Emerald Sea vessels for a pipeline, spool and risers flow assurance project in Qatar; and \n \u2022 successful execution and close-out improvements on the Safaniya Phase 2, Abu Ali Cables and Manifa facility projects, all with Saudi Aramco, and the offshore marine hookup campaign on a wellhead jacket and umbilical project in Qatar. \nThose benefits were partially offset by $8 million of operating loss for KJO Hout, an EPCI project in the Neutral Zone, because of changes to our execution plan and increased costs associated with the DB 27 vessel and subcontractor standby time due primarily to work permit delays. This project is in a loss position and is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2017.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating income as follows:\n \u2022 increased marine and hookup activities, improved marine vessel productivity and reimbursement for mobilization costs on the Karan 45, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 improved productivity and lower demobilization costs on the Abu Ali Cables, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 increased jacket and deck installation activity on the Manifa, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 reimbursement for vessel downtime/standby time on various Saudi Aramco projects; and \n \u2022 KJO Ratawi project close-out improvements. \nThose benefits were partially offset by a $20 million operating income deterioration on our ADMA 4 GI project in the U.A.E. because of changes in our execution plan, increased costs associated with the DB 32 vessel demobilization and productivity related cost increases during hookup and pre-commissioning work. See Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this change.\nASA-Operating income in 2016 and 2015 was $9 million and $31 million, respectively.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating income, as follows:\n \u2022 improved productivity and project execution cost savings and recognition of approved change orders on active projects; and \n \u2022 close-out improvements on our completed projects. \nThe 2016 period operating income was negatively impacted by $31 million resulting from a failure identified in certain supplier provided subsea-pipe connector components previously installed on the Ichthys project in Australia, as discussed in Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe 2016 and 2015 operating income included charges of $5 million and $20 million, respectively, related to restructuring, as discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditionally, in connection with a review of our long-lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2016, we determined that the carrying values of certain marine assets were not recoverable and exceeded their respective fair values. As a result, we recorded a $12 million non-cash impairment charge in our ASA segment. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating income in 2015 also included a $4 million impairment related to the DB 101 vessel and a $3 million loss on disposal of an asset, neither of which was repeated in 2016.\nOther Items in Operating Income\nCorporate and other expenses of $3 million and $13 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily relate to restructuring charges. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d)-SG&A was $179 million and $217 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We continue our efforts to improve our cost structure, and the implementation of both our MPI and AOR programs contributed to lower SG&A expense in 2016 compared to 2015. As of December 31, 2016, both the MPI and AOR programs are complete.\nOther Non-operating Items\nInterest expense, net-Interest expense, net was $59 million and $50 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Increase in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest capitalization in 2016 compared to 2015. The DLV 2000 vessel, which was under construction in 2015, was deployed to our fleet in the second quarter of 2016. Interest expense for both periods is associated with our long-term debt obligations discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProvision for Income Taxes-For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized income before provision for income taxes of $82 million, compared to income before provision for income taxes of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the aggregate, the provision for income taxes was $42 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily driven by increased mix of income in favorable tax jurisdictions, which was partially offset by losses in certain jurisdictions where we did not recognize a tax benefit. In addition, due to our improving operations, we were able to release the remaining $9 million valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset related to the Saudi Arabia net operating loss as well as partially release $4 million valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset related to the Mexico net operating loss as a result of current contracts in our backlog. Our effective tax rate decreased from 80% in 2015 to 51% in 2016.\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates-The loss from investments in our unconsolidated affiliates was $4 million and $21 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in losses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was primarily attributable to improved operating results of our China joint venture.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest-Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million and $9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $7 million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a loss incurred by Berlian McDermott Sdn. Bhd ( BMD\u201d), our former Malaysian joint venture and lower profitability in our Indonesian joint venture during 2016. In the third quarter of 2016, we acquired the BMD noncontrolling interest, as discussed in Note 17, Stockholders' Equity, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 Versus 2014\nRevenues\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AEA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 567,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (88,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,134,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 795,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 338,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,456,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 937,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 519,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,070,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,300,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 769,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues were $3,070 million and $2,301 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of approximately 33%, or $769 million, primarily due to increased activity in our ASA and MEA segments, partially offset by decreased activity in our AEA segment.\nAEA-Revenues decreased by 16%, or $89 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in active projects in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenue, as follows:\n \u2022 completion of fabrication and installation activity on the PB Litoral project and a $12 million reversal of a liquidated damage reserve related to the extension to the contract completion date associated with the PB Litoral project; \n \u2022 completion of engineering work and near completion of marine activities associated with the Exxon Julia subsea tieback project; \n \u2022 completion of various marine installation campaign projects executed by the DB 50 in the Gulf of Mexico awarded in 2014 and 2015; \n \u2022 higher NO 102 vessel charter activities in Brazil; and \n \u2022 the start-up of fabrication for a jacket replacement and deck installation on Ayatsil-C, an EPCI project awarded in 2015. \nSignificant projects contributing to the 2014 revenues that were either complete or substantially complete in 2014 were Papa Terra, Jack St. Malo, Gulfstar, Mafumeria Sul, Ayatsil-B, and Megalodon Platform Installation.\nMEA-Revenues increased by 43%, or $339 million, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenue, as follows:\n \u2022 significant increases in fabrication, marine pipelay, marine cable laying and hookup activities on the Karan 45 and Abu Ali Cables, both Saudi Aramco projects; \n \u2022 the installation of jackets and an observation platform on the Saudi Aramco Manifa project; \n \u2022 the commencement of engineering and fabrication activities for the replacement of power systems on the Marjan project; \n \u2022 the start of two new Saudi Aramco projects: (1) a lump-sum EPCI project under the LTA II and (2) a project to supply 12 jackets; \n \u2022 multiple change order awards on existing and new projects with Saudi Aramco; \n \u2022 increased fabrication and marine activities on the ADMA 4 GI project in the U.A.E.; and \n \u2022 increased marine and commissioning activity on the KJO Ratawi project in the Neutral Zone. \nIn 2014, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenue, as follows:\n \u2022 marine and fabrication activities on the Saudi Aramco Safaniya Phase-2 project; \n \u2022 completion of a pipelay project in the Caspian; and \n \u2022 substantial completion of a Saudi Aramco five jackets project. \nASA-Revenues increased by 55%, or $519 million, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenue, as follows:\n \u2022 a significant increase in marine activity on the Ichthys project; and \n \u2022 the start of two new projects in 2015: (1) the Brunei Shell Petroleum ( BSP\u201d) pipeline replacement project, which was completed in 2015; and (2) the Jangkrik subsea isolation valve and manifolds fabrication project in Indonesia. \nIn 2014, a variety of projects and activities, all of which were either complete or substantially complete in 2014, contributed to revenue as follows:\n \u2022 Siakap subsea development project in Malaysia; \n \u2022 Kepodang gas development project in Indonesia; \n \u2022 Champion Waterflood project in Brunei; \n \u2022 Banyu Urip project in Indonesia; and \n \u2022 DB 101 marine campaign projects. \nOperating Income\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AEA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,487\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (54,175\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,819\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,749\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,926\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,823\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income improved by $96 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to improvements in our AEA and MEA segments.\nAEA-Operating results improved by $41 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to unfavorable changes in estimates in 2014 with no corresponding impact in 2015.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating results, as follows:\n \u2022 increased fabrication and marine activities, as well as a $12 million reversal of a liquidated damage reserve due to the extension of the PB Litoral project contract on the PB Litoral completion date; \n \u2022 Agile, NO 105, and NO 102 marine charter activities in Brazil, on various projects; \n \u2022 the DB 50 vessel working on various projects in the Gulf of Mexico; and \n \u2022 a $14 million benefit resulting from additional close-out improvements and compensation for weather-related delays on the Papa Terra project. \nThe 2015 operating results also included:\n \u2022 a $17 million charge associated with a legal settlement; and \n \u2022 a $26 million non-cash MTM charge, as disclosed in Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe 2014 results were negatively impacted by changes in estimates of $69 million on the PB Litoral project, primarily due to increased costs arising from project delays, increases in projected fabrication, procurement and marine installation costs, reduced productivity and recognition of liquidated damages. Those negative factors in 2014 were partially offset by:\n \u2022 approximately $40 million of operating income related to the Papa Terra project in Brazil in 2014, mainly due to project close-out improvements, savings on marine costs and increased recoveries from additional weather-related compensation; and \n \u2022 $24 million of operating income in 2014 contributed by the successful completion of the Jack & St Malo and Gulfstar projects. \nThe 2014 operating income also included $35 million in gains from asset sales, which were not repeated in 2015.\nMEA- Operating income improved by $94 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating results, as follows:\n \u2022 increased marine and hookup activities, improved marine vessel productivity and reimbursement for mobilization costs on the Karan 45, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 improved productivity and lower demobilization costs on the Abu Ali Cables, Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 increased jacket and deck installation activity on the Manifa, a Saudi Aramco project; and \n \u2022 reimbursement for vessel downtime/standby time on various projects with Saudi Aramco. \nClose-out improvements on the KJO Ratawi project also contributed $16 million of benefit to operating income.\nThose increases were partially offset by a $20 million operating income deterioration on our ADMA 4 GI project in the U.A.E. because of changes in our execution plan, increased costs associated with the DB 32 vessel demobilization and productivity related cost increases during hookup and pre-commissioning work. See Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this change.\nThe 2014 operating income included a $66 million benefit from a pipelay project in the Caspian, which had minimal activity in 2015. In addition, 2014 included deteriorations, not repeated in 2015, of approximately:\n \u2022 $15 million primarily due to a revision in the execution plan as a result of delayed access to the KJO Ratawi project in the Neutral Zone; and \n \u2022 $13 million related to vessel downtime due to weather and standby delays on the Saudi Aramco Safaniya Phase-1 project. \nASA-Operating income decreased by $35 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The 2014 operating income included favorable changes in estimates of $52 million compared to $23 million in 2015 (see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating results. as follows:\n \u2022 higher marine activities and change in scope in 2015 on our Ichthys project with no comparable benefits in 2014; and \n \u2022 completion of the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project, which started in 2015. \nIn addition, 2015 included a $20 million restructuring charge (see Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe 2014 favorable change in estimates were mainly related to two EPCI projects, both completed in 2014: the Siakap subsea development project in Malaysia and the Champion Waterflood project in Brunei.\nAs a part of our restructuring, in the first quarter of 2015 one of our vessels, the DB101, which was held and used in our ASA segment, was written down to a fair value of $14 million, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $4 million. In the second quarter of 2015, we disposed of the asset and recognized an additional loss of $3 million. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Items in Operating Income\nCorporate and other expenses increased to $13 million in 2015 compared to $9 million in 2014, primarily as a result of restructuring charges. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a fourth quarter non-cash MTM pension charge of $26 million, partially offset by cost savings realized by MPI.\nGain (loss) on disposal of asset for 2014 primarily related to the following sales and disposals: (1) sale of the DB 16 and the KP1, resulting in a $11 million gain; (2) a gain from the sale of our Harbor Island facility near Corpus Christi, Texas of approximately $25 million; and (3) an aggregate gain of approximately $10 million from the disposal of various assets from our Morgan City facility.\nOther Non-operating Items\nInterest expense, net was $50 million in 2015 and $61 million in 2014. The 2015 interest expense was lower compared to 2014 primarily due to a one-time $28 million interest charge for unamortized issuance fees in the second quarter of 2014 related to the termination of bridge financing arrangements with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. Interest expense for 2015 includes full-year interest on all of our long-term debt obligations issued in April 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes-For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized income before provision for income taxes of $65 million, compared to a loss before provision for income taxes of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The provision for income taxes was $52 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily driven by increased profits in certain jurisdictions in which we operate (primarily Saudi Arabia and Australia). In addition, we were able to utilize past losses in certain jurisdictions which were previously un-benefited to offset our improving income (primarily Saudi Arabia and Singapore).\nOur effective tax rate for 2015 and 2014 was 80% and (54)%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily driven by increased profits in certain jurisdictions in which we operate (mainly Saudi Arabia and Australia), a valuation allowance against losses in tax jurisdictions where we do not expect to receive a tax benefit, and taxes on unremitted earnings in jurisdictions where we do not have plans to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. This resulted in an increase in our overall effective tax rate. See Note 15, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the rate reconciliation table.\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased by $14 million from an $8 million loss in 2014 to a $22 million loss in 2015, primarily due to increased operating losses on the joint ventures Qingdao McDermott Wuchuan Offshore, io Oil & Gas and THHE Fabricators Sdn. Bhd.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest-Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $9 million and $11 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to our acquisition of our partner's interest in our North Ocean joint venture related to the NO 102, partially offset by increased income from two of our consolidated affiliates.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), generally using historical U.S. dollar accounting ( historical cost\u201d). Statements based on historical cost, however, do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar, especially during times of significant and continued inflation.\nIn order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations, we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor, material and service costs either through an estimate of those changes, which we reflect in the original price, or through price escalation clauses in our contracts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary ongoing sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand. We regularly review our sources and uses of funds and may access capital markets to increase our liquidity position or to refinance our existing debt. We plan to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements with cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, or a combination thereof.\nManagement believes, based on our current financial condition and existing and expected backlog, that our cash flows from operations and the sources of liquidity and capital resources described below will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $612 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash compared to $782 million as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, we had $75 million of cash in jurisdictions outside the U.S., principally in Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico and Qatar. Approximately 4% of our outstanding cash balance is held in countries that have established government imposed currency restrictions that could impede the ability of our subsidiary to transfer funds to us.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $16 million, compared to $117 million as of December 31, 2015. The amounts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 include $16 million and $102 million, respectively, of cash collateral for letters of credit that generally may be replaced with letters of credit under the LC Facility.\nCash Flow Activities\nOperating activities-Net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $178 million, $55 million and $7 million, respectively.\nThe cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected our net income (loss), adjusted for non-cash items and changes in components of our working capital-accounts receivable, contracts in progress net of advance billings on contracts, and accounts payable. Fluctuations in working capital are normal in our business. Working capital is impacted by the size of our projects and the achievement of billing milestones on backlog as we complete certain phases of the project.\nWe believe our anticipated future operating cash flow, capacity under our credit facilities and uncommitted bilateral lines of credit, along with access to surety bonds will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, settle our commitments and contingencies and address our working capital needs in the foreseeable future.\nIn the first half of 2015, we reached agreements with a representative we previously utilized in our Middle East operations and certain of its affiliates and associates regarding: (1) the value and timing of payment of ongoing future amounts that were to be paid under a representation agreement that we elected to allow to expire, with respect to: (a) commissions on customer contracts that we had entered into prior to such expiration; and (b) future commissions payable on customer contracts we expected to enter into during a specified post-expiration period under the representation agreement (pursuant to provisions that provided for commissions to be payable on customer contracts entered into during such post-expiration period); and (2) our repurchase of shares of capital stock in one of our subsidiaries previously held by them. Under these agreements, we agreed to make a series of payments in respect of the commissions that were expected to become due and payable under the prior arrangement. We paid approximately $21 million in March 2015, $26 million in April 2015 and $4 million in the second half of 2015 in connection with these agreements.\nInvesting activities-Our net cash used in investing activities was $231 million, $96 million and $245 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash used in 2016 primarily related to the construction of the Deepwater Lay Vessel 2000 ( DLV 2000\u201d), and was incurred as a result of the construction work reaching established milestones, including completion in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe change in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures. A lower level of capital spending in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the delay in completion of our DLV 2000, resulting from deferrals of milestone payments, and lower payments in 2015 for our CSV 108 vessel, which was completed and put in service in the first quarter of 2015.\nProceeds from disposition of assets provided cash of $2 million, $11 million and $72 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFinancing activities-Our net cash used in financing activities was $116 million and $28 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was $951 million.\nNet cash used in 2016 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of $75 million under the Term Loan discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, and $16 million and $8 million of repayments related to the Amortizing Notes comprising part of TEUs described below under Credit Agreement and Debt\u201d and NO 105 construction financing, respectively.\nNet cash used in 2015 was primarily attributable to $15 million and $8 million of repayments related to the Amortizing Notes and NO 105 construction financing, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was primarily attributable to the financing transactions completed in April 2014, as discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash provided was partially offset by:\n \u2022 our exercise, in October 2014, of our option to purchase the interest of our joint venture partner, Oceanteam Shipping ASA, in the NO 102 vessel-owning entities, at a net cost of approximately $33 million. We completed the acquisition of the additional interest in December 2014; and \n \u2022 a $6 million distribution to noncontrolling interests. \nCredit Agreement and Debt\nIn April 2014 we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which initially provided for a $400 million first-lien, first-out three-year letter of credit facility (the LC Facility\u201d), scheduled to mature in 2017, and a $300 million first-lien, second-out five-year term loan (the Term Loan\u201d), scheduled to mature in 2019. We also completed the issuance of (a) $500 million of second-lien, seven-year, senior secured notes; and (b) $288 million of tangible equity units ( TEUs\u201d) composed of (1) three-year amortizing, senior unsecured notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $48 million, and (2) prepaid common stock purchase contracts.\nIn October 2015, we entered into an amendment which amended the Credit Agreement primarily to increase the existing LC Facility from $400 million to $520 million.\nIn February 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit us to add to Covenant EBITDA certain cash restructuring expenses related to the conclusion of MPI or implementation of AOR for the quarters ending on or after March 31, 2016 but before April 16, 2017, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million (as of any date of determination).\nOn April 18, 2016, we entered into another amendment to the Credit Agreement, which, among other things:\n \u2022 replaced the existing EBITDA covenant with new ratios as follows: \n \u2022 a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 1.15x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each fiscal quarter thereafter; \n \u2022 a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 4.5x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each subsequent fiscal quarter through June 30, 2017, 4.0x for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, and 3.5x for each fiscal quarter thereafter; and \n \u2022 a maximum secured leverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 2.0x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each subsequent fiscal quarter through December 31, 2017, and 1.5x for each fiscal quarter thereafter; \n \u2022 amended the maximum capital expenditure covenant to limit capital expenditures in 2016 and thereafter to $250 million each fiscal year, with any prior fiscal year unused capital expenditures up to $125 million able to be carried forward and added to the next year's capital expenditure capacity, for a total of $375 million; \n \u2022 extended the maturity date of the LC Facility commitments; \n \u2022 changed the existing letter of credit capacity to $450 million; \n \u2022 extended the deadline for mortgaging the DLV 2000 to one year after taking delivery thereof, and gave McDermott the option to consider potential financing options for the DLV 2000 during that period; \n \u2022 increased the basket for purchase money indebtedness to $150 million; \n \u2022 modified the covenant limiting acquisitions to permit up to $150 million of acquisitions; and \n \u2022 modified the covenant limiting the prepayment or purchase of junior priority debt to permit up to $100 million of such prepayments or purchases. \nOn May 12, 2016, we entered into a further amendment to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, increased the applicable margin payable on the Term Loan by 3.0% per annum and requires that the net cash proceeds of any sale (including a sale and leaseback) of the DLV 2000 be applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loan.\nOn May 13, 2016, we prepaid $75 million of the Term Loan and satisfied the other conditions to the effective date\u201d set forth in the last amendment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, as shown below:\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td> Ratios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.15x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.36x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum total leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.36x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum secured leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.73x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCalculation of ratios under the Credit Agreement, as amended, requires us to compute consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted ( Covenant EBITDA\u201d).

In addition, as of December 31, 2016 we had $359 million of outstanding bank guarantees issued under uncommitted lines of credit and $79 million of surety bonds issued under general agreements of indemnity.\nSee Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our credit facilities and other indebtness.\nCapital Expenditures\nAs part of our strategic growth program, our management regularly evaluates our marine vessel fleet and our fabrication yard construction capacity to ensure our fleet and construction capabilities are adequately aligned with our overall growth strategy. These assessments may result in capital expenditures to construct, upgrade, acquire or operate vessels or acquire or upgrade fabrication yards that would enhance or grow our technical capabilities, or may involve engaging in discussions to dispose of certain marine vessels or fabrication yards.\nCapital expenditures for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $228 million, $103 million and $321 million, respectively, discussed below:\n \u2022 2016 capital expenditures were primarily attributable to the construction of the DLV 2000, and were incurred as a result of the construction work reaching established milestones, including completion in the second quarter of 2016. \n \u2022 2015 capital expenditures were primarily attributable to the construction of the DLV 2000, as well as costs associated with upgrading the capabilities of other marine vessels. \n \u2022 2014 capital expenditures were primarily attributable to construction of the CSV 108, development of our Altamira, Mexico fabrication yard, and certain upgrades and equipment expenditures associated with other vessels in our marine fleet. The CSV 108 was substantially complete at December 31, 2014, and the vessel was put into service in February 2015. \nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2016. Certain amounts included in this table are based on some estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual and other obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because some estimates and assumptions are subjective.\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt and capital lease obligations1\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 766,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated interest payments2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 225,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 226,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including capital lease obligations.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report.\nUse of Estimates-We use estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and variances could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Changes in project estimates generally exclude change orders and changes in scope, but may include, without limitation, unexpected changes in weather conditions, productivity, unanticipated vessel repair requirements, customer, subcontractor and supplier delays and other costs. We generally expect to experience a variety of unanticipated events, and some of these events can result in significant cost increases above cost amounts we previously estimated. As of December 31, 2016, we have provided for our estimated costs to complete on all of our ongoing contracts. However, it is possible that current estimates could change due to unforeseen events, which could result in adjustments to overall contract costs. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in material adjustments to operating results. See Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition-We generally recognize contract revenues and related costs on a percentage-of-completion method for individual contracts or combinations of contracts based on work performed, man hours, or a cost-to-cost method, as applicable to the activity involved.\nAt the outset of each project, we prepare a detailed analysis of our estimated cost to complete the project. Total estimated project costs, and resulting contract income, are affected by changes in the expected cost of materials and labor, productivity, vessel costs, scheduling and other factors. In order to record revenue and profits on these projects, we multiply the total estimated profit over the life of the project by the current percentage towards completion based on the appropriate units noted above. Estimated losses on a project are recorded in full in the period the loss becomes known.\nEstimated profit over the life of a project includes consideration of contract price, change orders, claims, costs incurred and estimated costs to complete. Change orders, which are a normal and recurring part of our business, can increase (sometimes substantially) the future scope and cost of a job. Revenue from unapproved change orders is generally recognized to the extent of the lesser of amounts we expect to recover or costs incurred. To the extent claims included in backlog are not resolved in our favor, there could be reductions in, or reversals of previously reported amounts of, revenues and profits, and charges against current earnings, which could be material.\nWe regularly review contract price and cost estimates as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit, proportionate to the job percentage of completion in the period, when those estimates are revised. External factors such as weather, customer requirements, timely availability of materials, productivity, and other factors outside of our control may affect the progress and estimated cost of a project's completion which could materially impact the timing and amount of our revenue and income recognition. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nLoss Contingencies- We record liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. We provide disclosure when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision or if such loss is not reasonably estimable. We have accrued our estimates of the probable losses associated with these matters and associated legal costs are generally recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. However, our losses are typically resolved over long periods of time and are often difficult to estimate due to various factors, including the possibility of multiple actions by third parties. Therefore, it is possible future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates related to these matters.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans-We estimate income or expense related to our pension and postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial assumptions, including assumptions regarding discount rates and expected returns on plan assets adjusted for the current period actuarial gains and losses. We determine our discount rate based on a review of published financial data and discussions with our actuary regarding rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of our pension obligations. Based on historical data and discussions with our investment consultant, we determine our expected return on plan assets based on the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets and the market value of our plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the expected return of the various asset classes held in the plan, weighted by the target allocation of the plan's assets. Changes in these assumptions can result in significant changes in our estimated pension income or expense and our consolidated financial condition. We revise our assumptions annually based upon changes in current interest rates, return on plan assets and the underlying demographics of our workforce. These assumptions are reasonably likely to change in future periods and may have a material impact on future earnings.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for our pension plan.\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect on\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Pretax Pension\nExpense in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension Benefit\nObligation at\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In Millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 25-basis-point change in discount rate\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 25-basis-point change in expected long-term rate of return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information on our pension plans.\nImpairment-We review our tangible long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation is required, the fair value of each applicable asset is compared to its carrying value. Factors that impact our determination of potential impairment include forecasted utilization of equipment and estimates of forecasted cash flows from projects expected to be performed in future periods. Our estimates of cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions or changes in operating performance. Any changes in such factors may negatively affect our business segments and result in future asset impairments.\nDeferred Taxes-We believe that our deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2016 are realizable through carrybacks, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If we subsequently determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, the resulting adjustment would increase earnings for the period in which such determination was made. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Any changes to our estimated valuation allowance could be material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See Note 15, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our deferred taxes.\nAccounting and Reporting Changes\nFor a discussion of the potential impact of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStatements we make in the following discussion which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Items 1 and 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.\nGeneral\nMDR is a leading provider of integrated engineering, procurement, construction and installation ( EPCI\u201d), front-end engineering and design ( FEED\u201d), and module fabrication services for upstream field developments worldwide. We deliver fixed and floating production facilities, pipeline installations and subsea systems from concept to commissioning for complex offshore and subsea oil and gas projects. Operating in approximately 20 countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, our integrated resources include a diversified fleet of marine vessels, fabrication facilities and engineering offices. We support our activities with comprehensive project management and procurement services, while utilizing our fully integrated capabilities in both shallow water and deepwater construction.\nWe report financial results under three reporting segments consisting of (1) the Americas, Europe and Africa ( AEA\u201d), (2) the Middle East ( MEA\u201d) and (3) Asia ( ASA\u201d). We also report certain corporate and other non-operating activities under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d Corporate and other primarily reflects costs that are not allocated to our operating segments. For financial information about our segments, see Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business activity depends mainly on capital expenditures for offshore construction services of major integrated oil and gas companies and national oil companies for the construction of development projects in the regions in which we operate. Our operations are generally capital intensive and rely on large contracts, which can account for a substantial amount of our revenues.\nOverview\nOur performance is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. Some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices, global oil supply, the world economy, the availability of credit, government regulation and global stability. Under the current macro commodity environment, we have seen continued pressure from customer capital expenditure spending delays, stronger competitive pricing pressure given contraction in certain markets, and lower utilization of our assets. However, we believe our long-term industry position remains favorable, and we will continue to maintain our focus on opportunities, customer alignment, efficient execution of our backlog, efficient asset utilization, and costs control and liquidity management. We will also continue positioning ourselves for growth when the global oil and gas industry rebounds and the producers increase their capital spending.\nOperating Results\n2016-We have a strong foundation for 2017. Our backlog at December 31, 2016 was $4.3 billion. Approximately $3 billion of this backlog is expected to roll-off in 2017. Significant new awards under the second Saudi Aramco Long Term Agreement ( LTA II\u201d), two other significant awards, with one in our AEA segment and one in our ASA segment, and a number of change orders contributed to our backlog increase.\nRevenues decreased by $434 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower activity on our Ichthys project and completion of the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project in our ASA segment. That decrease was partially offset by increased activities on several of our MEA segment projects.\nOperating income increased by $29 million from $113 million in 2015 to $142 million in 2016 despite the challenging environment of low crude oil and natural gas prices. We believe our performance indicates our capability to deliver strong results under a wide range of operating environments due to strong project execution and cost management driven by the One McDermott Way\u201d Initiative.\nThe 2016 period operating income was positively impacted by:\n \u2022 successful completion of the 12 jacket Saudi Aramco project and a large Middle East pipeline-related project; \n \u2022 progress on a lump sum EPCI project under the LTA II, and efficient execution and related cost saving on the Marjan power systems replacement project, both Saudi Aramco projects; and \n \u2022 close-out improvements, favorable changes in estimates and recognition of approved change orders on active and closed projects. \nThe 2016 period operating income was negatively impacted by $31 million resulting from a failure identified in certain supplier provided subsea-pipe connector components previously installed on the Ichthys project in Australia, as discussed in Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA total of $55 million of non-cash impairment charges related to our Agile vessel and certain other marine assets impacted our 2016 operating income, as discussed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurement, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2016 we realized approximately $150 million and $46 million of cash savings, before restructuring charges, from our McDermott Profitability Initiative ( MPI\u201d) and Additional Overhead Reduction program ( AOR\u201d), respectively. MPI was completed during the third quarter of 2016 and AOR was completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n2015-Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 was $4.2 billion. A significant award under the LTA II, two key awards in Qatar and a number of change orders contributed to $3.7 billion of backlog increase, partially offset by $3 billion of revenue roll-off during 2015, resulting in a net increase of approximately $631 million over our backlog as of December 31, 2014.\nRevenues for 2015 were approximately $3 billion, an increase of $769 million, or 33%, over 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to:\n \u2022 progress, driven by marine activities, on the Ichthys project; \n \u2022 completion of the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project; \n \u2022 a significant increase in activities associated with several of our Middle East projects; and \n \u2022 increased fabrication and marine activities on the PB Litoral project. \nOperating income was $113 million in 2015, an increase of $96 million compared to 2014. Operating income was positively impacted by:\n \u2022 strong project execution, including on the Ichthys project, where the activities remained on schedule; \n \u2022 successful completion of the Manifa, Abu Ali and Karan 45 projects, all with Saudi Aramco; and \n \u2022 completion of fabrication, installation and hook up of the PB Litoral facilities. \nSignificant items we recognized as charges in our operating income included:\n \u2022 $41 million for the restructuring actions discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; \n \u2022 a $26 million non-cash mark-to-market ( MTM\u201d) actuarial loss on our pension benefit plans, discussed in Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; and \n \u2022 a $17 million charge associated with a legal settlement in the third quarter of 2015. \nDuring 2015, from our MPI program, we realized approximately $115 million of cash savings, before restructuring charges. In addition, we continued our efforts to improve our cost structure and commenced AOR during the fourth quarter of 2015.\n2014-Operating income of $16 million included favorable changes in estimates of $111 million due to:\n \u2022 project closeout benefits and reimbursement for weather downtime and vessel standby time, for further discussion see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; \n \u2022 a gain of $46 million associated with the sale of non-core assets; and \n \u2022 an improvement of $11 million related to a change in estimate of vessel-impairment charges recognized in 2013 for the CSV 108 pipelay system, for further discussion see Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThose increases were partially offset by $110 million of increased costs to complete certain projects, primarily due to marine equipment downtime driven by adverse weather conditions, mechanical issues and standby delays and accrual for liquidated damages (see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, we incurred a charge in the amount of $18 million associated with our ongoing restructuring programs, as discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe demand for our services is affected by the capital expenditure decisions of oil and gas producers. Material declines in oil and natural gas prices have affected, and will likely continue to affect, the demand for and pricing of our EPCI services. Many of our customers make their capital expenditure decisions based on their long-term view of oil and gas prices and the economics of specific projects. We operate in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world, work on both new and existing field developments and provide services that require a varying amount of technical complexity. As a result, the economics of specific projects that we provide services for varies considerably.\nThe sustained relatively lower-oil-price environment since 2014 and the slowdown of growth in certain developing countries has raised uncertainty around the economics of certain potential projects that have not yet been approved or awarded by our customers. We do not currently have any reason to expect cancellation of existing projects in our backlog. Nonetheless, the continued relatively depressed price of oil has adversely affected demand for our services and could, over a sustained period of time, materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince the start of the most recent substantial decline in the price of oil, many oil and gas companies made significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets for 2015 and 2016. Though some of our customers have reduced their current levels of spending on exploration, development and production programs, including by deferring or delaying certain capital projects, we do expect other capital projects to continue, as they are economic or strategically necessary in a variety of oil and gas price environments. We also expect that project deferrals and delays, combined with the natural decline rates of existing production and the resetting of the industry cost base, will ultimately contribute to further investment by oil and gas producers in the long-term.\nIn the current environment, we will continue to maintain our focus on opportunities, customer alignment, efficient execution of our backlog, efficient asset utilization and cost and liquidity management. We will also continue positioning ourselves for growth when the global oil and gas industry rebounds and the producers increase their capital spending.\nSegment Operations\n2016 Versus 2015\nRevenues\n\nRevenues decreased by 14%, or $434 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in our AEA and ASA segments, partially offset by an increase in our MEA segment.\nAEA-Revenues decreased by 40%, or $193 million, due to a reduction in active projects in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenues, as follows:\n \u2022 completion of jacket fabrication activity at our Altamira facility in Mexico and its installation campaign undertaken by the DB 50 vessel on the Ayatsil-C jacket replacement project; \n \u2022 transportation, installation and marine campaigns executed by the DB 50 and NO 105 vessels on the EOG Sercan project in Trinidad; \n \u2022 hookup and commissioning activities associated with the PB Litoral project in Mexico, which was completed in the first half of 2016; \n \u2022 fabrication, spooling and installation of jumpers and control umbilicals on the Jack St. Malo project in the Gulf of Mexico, which was completed in the third quarter of 2016; \n \u2022 commencement of engineering work on the Abkatun-A2 platform project, a turnkey EPCI contract in the Gulf of Mexico awarded in 2016; \n \u2022 umbilical and flowline installation marine campaigns by the North Ocean 102 ( NO 102\u201d) and NO 105 vessels for the Caesar Tonga field development project in the Gulf of Mexico; \n \u2022 completion of the LLOG Otis subsea tieback project in the Gulf of Mexico; \n \u2022 marine campaigns executed by the DB 50 vessel on the Exxon Julia subsea tieback project in the Gulf of Mexico, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016; and \n \u2022 multiple front-end engineering and design projects. \nIn 2015, the following projects, which were complete or substantially complete in 2015, contributed to revenue:\n \u2022 NO 102, NO 105 and Agile vessel charter campaigns in Brazil; \n \u2022 completion of fabrication and installation activity on the PB Litoral project, as well as the reversal of a $12 million provision for liquidated damages due to an agreed extension of the PB Litoral project completion date; \n \u2022 marine campaigns executed by the DB 50 vessel, primarily on the Exxon Julia subsea tieback project, the Ayatsil-A project, a transportation and installation ( T&I\u201d) project, and a mobile drilling structure installation project; and \n \u2022 close-out improvements on our Papa Terra project. \nThe start-up of fabrication work on the Ayatsil-C jacket replacement project at our Altamira facility, awarded in 2015, also contributed to 2015 revenue.\nMEA-Revenues increased by 9%, or $107 million, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenues, as follows:\n \u2022 engineering, fabrication and marine activities on a lump-sum EPCI project under the LTA II entered into with Saudi Aramco; \n \u2022 continued fabrication and marine installation progress on the 12 jacket Saudi Aramco project, which was completed in 2016; \n \u2022 fabrication and marine cablelay activities on the Marjan Saudi Aramco power system replacement project; \n \u2022 commencement and substantial completion of a large pipeline-related project in the Middle East; \n \u2022 the marine campaign for installation of a pipeline, spool and risers on a flow assurance project in Qatar, awarded in the fourth quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 engineering, fabrication and marine activity on our KJO Hout project in the Neutral Zone; \n \u2022 commencement and substantial completion of offshore marine hookup campaign progress on a wellhead jacket and umbilical project in Qatar; and \n \u2022 the Qatar Petroleum EPCI project, which was completed in 2016. \nClose out improvements on the Safaniya phase 2 and ADMA 4 GI projects also contributed to 2016 revenue.\nIn 2015, activities on the following projects, which either were complete or were substantially complete in 2015, contributed to revenues:\n \u2022 the Safaniya phase 2, Manifa facilities, Karan 45 and Abu Ali Cables projects, each with Saudi Aramco; and \n \u2022 the ADMA 4 GI project in the U.A.E. \nCommencement in 2015 of a lump-sum EPCI project under the LTA II, the Marjan power system replacement project and the KJO Hout project also contributed to 2015 revenue.\nASA-Revenues decreased 24%, or $349 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced activity in 2016 on our Ichthys EPCI project in Australia, as the project progressed through to the marine transportation and installation phase.\nThose decreases were partially offset by the following projects:\n \u2022 higher fabrication activity in 2016 on the Yamal project awarded in the third quarter of 2015; \n \u2022 commencement in 2016 of the Vashishta subsea field infrastructure development work, an EPCI project in India; and \n \u2022 the Bergading offshore installation project in Malaysia, which was completed in the second quarter of 2016. \nIn 2015 the following projects, which were either complete or were substantially complete in 2015, contributed to revenue:\n \u2022 the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project; \n \u2022 the Gorgon MRU project; and \n \u2022 the Bukit-Tua platform/subsea spools installation project. \nOperating Income\nOperating income is frequently influenced by the resolution of change orders, project close-outs and settlements, which generally can cause operating margins to improve during the period in which these items are approved or finalized. While we expect change orders, close-outs and settlements to continue as part of our normal business activities, the period in which they are recognized is largely driven by the finalization of agreements with customers and suppliers and, as a result, is difficult to predict. Additionally, the future margin increases or decreases associated with these items are difficult to predict, due to, among other items, the difficulty of predicting the timing of recognition of change orders, close-outs and settlements and the timing of new project awards.\n\nOperating income improved by $30 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to improvements in our MEA segment.\nAEA-Operating losses were $30 million and $13 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2016, the operating results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 a $43 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Agile vessel and Intermac 600 cargo barge, as discussed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurement, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; and \n \u2022 lower cost recovery associated with our fabrication facility at Altamira and our vessels due to a reduction in active projects. \nThose negative factors were partially offset by:\n \u2022 net favorable changes in estimates of approximately an additional $28 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 (see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements); \n \u2022 successful execution and close-out improvements on the PB Litoral, Jack St. Malo II and Exxon Julia subsea tieback projects; \n \u2022 productivity improvement and associated cost savings related to our DB 50 and NO 102 vessels' marine campaigns undertaken in the Gulf of Mexico; and \n \u2022 the reversal of a $7 million provision for liquidated damages due to an agreed extension of the PB Litoral project completion date. \nFurthermore, 2016 operating results were positively impacted by a $4 million non-cash MTM pension gain, as discussed in Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe 2015 operating results were negatively impacted by:\n \u2022 a $26 million non-cash MTM pension charge, as discussed in Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements; \n \u2022 a $17 million legal settlement charge, which was not repeated in 2016; and \n \u2022 a $10 million restructuring charge, as discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThose negative factors were partially offset by:\n \u2022 marine charter activities undertaken by the NO 102, NO 105 and Agile vessels on various projects in Brazil; \n \u2022 the DB 50's marine campaigns on various projects in the Gulf of Mexico; \n \u2022 benefits as a result of a favorable outcome in our discussions with the customer on compensation for weather-related delays on the Papa Terra project; and \n \u2022 increased fabrication and marine activities on the PB Litoral project, as well as the reversal of a $12 million provision for liquidated damages due to an agreed extension of the PB Litoral project completion date. \nMEA-Operating income in 2016 and 2015 was $167 million and $108 million, respectively, an increase of $59 million year on year.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating income, as follows:\n \u2022 the completion in 2016 of jacket fabrication and marine installation activity coupled with close-out improvements on the 12 jacket Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 progress driven by higher engineering, fabrication and marine pipelay activity, as well as improved productivity and associated cost savings, on a lump sum EPCI project under the Saudi Aramco LTA II agreement; \n \u2022 increased engineering, marine cable lay activities, and award of a jacket change order, together with efficient execution and related cost saving on the Marjan power systems replacement, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 start and substantial completion of a large pipeline-related project in the Middle East; \n \u2022 marine installation activities undertaken by the DB 32 and Emerald Sea vessels for a pipeline, spool and risers flow assurance project in Qatar; and \n \u2022 successful execution and close-out improvements on the Safaniya Phase 2, Abu Ali Cables and Manifa facility projects, all with Saudi Aramco, and the offshore marine hookup campaign on a wellhead jacket and umbilical project in Qatar. \nThose benefits were partially offset by $8 million of operating loss for KJO Hout, an EPCI project in the Neutral Zone, because of changes to our execution plan and increased costs associated with the DB 27 vessel and subcontractor standby time due primarily to work permit delays. This project is in a loss position and is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2017.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating income as follows:\n \u2022 increased marine and hookup activities, improved marine vessel productivity and reimbursement for mobilization costs on the Karan 45, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 improved productivity and lower demobilization costs on the Abu Ali Cables, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 increased jacket and deck installation activity on the Manifa, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 reimbursement for vessel downtime/standby time on various Saudi Aramco projects; and \n \u2022 KJO Ratawi project close-out improvements. \nThose benefits were partially offset by a $20 million operating income deterioration on our ADMA 4 GI project in the U.A.E. because of changes in our execution plan, increased costs associated with the DB 32 vessel demobilization and productivity related cost increases during hookup and pre-commissioning work. See Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this change.\nASA-Operating income in 2016 and 2015 was $9 million and $31 million, respectively.\nIn 2016, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating income, as follows:\n \u2022 improved productivity and project execution cost savings and recognition of approved change orders on active projects; and \n \u2022 close-out improvements on our completed projects. \nThe 2016 period operating income was negatively impacted by $31 million resulting from a failure identified in certain supplier provided subsea-pipe connector components previously installed on the Ichthys project in Australia, as discussed in Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe 2016 and 2015 operating income included charges of $5 million and $20 million, respectively, related to restructuring, as discussed in Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditionally, in connection with a review of our long-lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2016, we determined that the carrying values of certain marine assets were not recoverable and exceeded their respective fair values. As a result, we recorded a $12 million non-cash impairment charge in our ASA segment. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating income in 2015 also included a $4 million impairment related to the DB 101 vessel and a $3 million loss on disposal of an asset, neither of which was repeated in 2016.\nOther Items in Operating Income\nCorporate and other expenses of $3 million and $13 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily relate to restructuring charges. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d)-SG&A was $179 million and $217 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We continue our efforts to improve our cost structure, and the implementation of both our MPI and AOR programs contributed to lower SG&A expense in 2016 compared to 2015. As of December 31, 2016, both the MPI and AOR programs are complete.\nOther Non-operating Items\nInterest expense, net-Interest expense, net was $59 million and $50 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Increase in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest capitalization in 2016 compared to 2015. The DLV 2000 vessel, which was under construction in 2015, was deployed to our fleet in the second quarter of 2016. Interest expense for both periods is associated with our long-term debt obligations discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProvision for Income Taxes-For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized income before provision for income taxes of $82 million, compared to income before provision for income taxes of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the aggregate, the provision for income taxes was $42 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily driven by increased mix of income in favorable tax jurisdictions, which was partially offset by losses in certain jurisdictions where we did not recognize a tax benefit. In addition, due to our improving operations, we were able to release the remaining $9 million valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset related to the Saudi Arabia net operating loss as well as partially release $4 million valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset related to the Mexico net operating loss as a result of current contracts in our backlog. Our effective tax rate decreased from 80% in 2015 to 51% in 2016.\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates-The loss from investments in our unconsolidated affiliates was $4 million and $21 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in losses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was primarily attributable to improved operating results of our China joint venture.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest-Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million and $9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $7 million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a loss incurred by Berlian McDermott Sdn. Bhd ( BMD\u201d), our former Malaysian joint venture and lower profitability in our Indonesian joint venture during 2016. In the third quarter of 2016, we acquired the BMD noncontrolling interest, as discussed in Note 17, Stockholders' Equity, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 Versus 2014\nRevenues\n\nRevenues were $3,070 million and $2,301 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of approximately 33%, or $769 million, primarily due to increased activity in our ASA and MEA segments, partially offset by decreased activity in our AEA segment.\nAEA-Revenues decreased by 16%, or $89 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in active projects in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenue, as follows:\n \u2022 completion of fabrication and installation activity on the PB Litoral project and a $12 million reversal of a liquidated damage reserve related to the extension to the contract completion date associated with the PB Litoral project; \n \u2022 completion of engineering work and near completion of marine activities associated with the Exxon Julia subsea tieback project; \n \u2022 completion of various marine installation campaign projects executed by the DB 50 in the Gulf of Mexico awarded in 2014 and 2015; \n \u2022 higher NO 102 vessel charter activities in Brazil; and \n \u2022 the start-up of fabrication for a jacket replacement and deck installation on Ayatsil-C, an EPCI project awarded in 2015. \nSignificant projects contributing to the 2014 revenues that were either complete or substantially complete in 2014 were Papa Terra, Jack St. Malo, Gulfstar, Mafumeria Sul, Ayatsil-B, and Megalodon Platform Installation.\nMEA-Revenues increased by 43%, or $339 million, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenue, as follows:\n \u2022 significant increases in fabrication, marine pipelay, marine cable laying and hookup activities on the Karan 45 and Abu Ali Cables, both Saudi Aramco projects; \n \u2022 the installation of jackets and an observation platform on the Saudi Aramco Manifa project; \n \u2022 the commencement of engineering and fabrication activities for the replacement of power systems on the Marjan project; \n \u2022 the start of two new Saudi Aramco projects: (1) a lump-sum EPCI project under the LTA II and (2) a project to supply 12 jackets; \n \u2022 multiple change order awards on existing and new projects with Saudi Aramco; \n \u2022 increased fabrication and marine activities on the ADMA 4 GI project in the U.A.E.; and \n \u2022 increased marine and commissioning activity on the KJO Ratawi project in the Neutral Zone. \nIn 2014, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenue, as follows:\n \u2022 marine and fabrication activities on the Saudi Aramco Safaniya Phase-2 project; \n \u2022 completion of a pipelay project in the Caspian; and \n \u2022 substantial completion of a Saudi Aramco five jackets project. \nASA-Revenues increased by 55%, or $519 million, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to revenue, as follows:\n \u2022 a significant increase in marine activity on the Ichthys project; and \n \u2022 the start of two new projects in 2015: (1) the Brunei Shell Petroleum ( BSP\u201d) pipeline replacement project, which was completed in 2015; and (2) the Jangkrik subsea isolation valve and manifolds fabrication project in Indonesia. \nIn 2014, a variety of projects and activities, all of which were either complete or substantially complete in 2014, contributed to revenue as follows:\n \u2022 Siakap subsea development project in Malaysia; \n \u2022 Kepodang gas development project in Indonesia; \n \u2022 Champion Waterflood project in Brunei; \n \u2022 Banyu Urip project in Indonesia; and \n \u2022 DB 101 marine campaign projects. \nOperating Income\n\nOperating income improved by $96 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to improvements in our AEA and MEA segments.\nAEA-Operating results improved by $41 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to unfavorable changes in estimates in 2014 with no corresponding impact in 2015.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating results, as follows:\n \u2022 increased fabrication and marine activities, as well as a $12 million reversal of a liquidated damage reserve due to the extension of the PB Litoral project contract on the PB Litoral completion date; \n \u2022 Agile, NO 105, and NO 102 marine charter activities in Brazil, on various projects; \n \u2022 the DB 50 vessel working on various projects in the Gulf of Mexico; and \n \u2022 a $14 million benefit resulting from additional close-out improvements and compensation for weather-related delays on the Papa Terra project. \nThe 2015 operating results also included:\n \u2022 a $17 million charge associated with a legal settlement; and \n \u2022 a $26 million non-cash MTM charge, as disclosed in Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe 2014 results were negatively impacted by changes in estimates of $69 million on the PB Litoral project, primarily due to increased costs arising from project delays, increases in projected fabrication, procurement and marine installation costs, reduced productivity and recognition of liquidated damages. Those negative factors in 2014 were partially offset by:\n \u2022 approximately $40 million of operating income related to the Papa Terra project in Brazil in 2014, mainly due to project close-out improvements, savings on marine costs and increased recoveries from additional weather-related compensation; and \n \u2022 $24 million of operating income in 2014 contributed by the successful completion of the Jack & St Malo and Gulfstar projects. \nThe 2014 operating income also included $35 million in gains from asset sales, which were not repeated in 2015.\nMEA- Operating income improved by $94 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating results, as follows:\n \u2022 increased marine and hookup activities, improved marine vessel productivity and reimbursement for mobilization costs on the Karan 45, a Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 improved productivity and lower demobilization costs on the Abu Ali Cables, Saudi Aramco project; \n \u2022 increased jacket and deck installation activity on the Manifa, a Saudi Aramco project; and \n \u2022 reimbursement for vessel downtime/standby time on various projects with Saudi Aramco. \nClose-out improvements on the KJO Ratawi project also contributed $16 million of benefit to operating income.\nThose increases were partially offset by a $20 million operating income deterioration on our ADMA 4 GI project in the U.A.E. because of changes in our execution plan, increased costs associated with the DB 32 vessel demobilization and productivity related cost increases during hookup and pre-commissioning work. See Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this change.\nThe 2014 operating income included a $66 million benefit from a pipelay project in the Caspian, which had minimal activity in 2015. In addition, 2014 included deteriorations, not repeated in 2015, of approximately:\n \u2022 $15 million primarily due to a revision in the execution plan as a result of delayed access to the KJO Ratawi project in the Neutral Zone; and \n \u2022 $13 million related to vessel downtime due to weather and standby delays on the Saudi Aramco Safaniya Phase-1 project. \nASA-Operating income decreased by $35 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The 2014 operating income included favorable changes in estimates of $52 million compared to $23 million in 2015 (see Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn 2015, a variety of projects and activities contributed to operating results. as follows:\n \u2022 higher marine activities and change in scope in 2015 on our Ichthys project with no comparable benefits in 2014; and \n \u2022 completion of the Brunei Shell pipeline replacement project, which started in 2015. \nIn addition, 2015 included a $20 million restructuring charge (see Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe 2014 favorable change in estimates were mainly related to two EPCI projects, both completed in 2014: the Siakap subsea development project in Malaysia and the Champion Waterflood project in Brunei.\nAs a part of our restructuring, in the first quarter of 2015 one of our vessels, the DB101, which was held and used in our ASA segment, was written down to a fair value of $14 million, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $4 million. In the second quarter of 2015, we disposed of the asset and recognized an additional loss of $3 million. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Items in Operating Income\nCorporate and other expenses increased to $13 million in 2015 compared to $9 million in 2014, primarily as a result of restructuring charges. See Note 4, Restructuring, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a fourth quarter non-cash MTM pension charge of $26 million, partially offset by cost savings realized by MPI.\nGain (loss) on disposal of asset for 2014 primarily related to the following sales and disposals: (1) sale of the DB 16 and the KP1, resulting in a $11 million gain; (2) a gain from the sale of our Harbor Island facility near Corpus Christi, Texas of approximately $25 million; and (3) an aggregate gain of approximately $10 million from the disposal of various assets from our Morgan City facility.\nOther Non-operating Items\nInterest expense, net was $50 million in 2015 and $61 million in 2014. The 2015 interest expense was lower compared to 2014 primarily due to a one-time $28 million interest charge for unamortized issuance fees in the second quarter of 2014 related to the termination of bridge financing arrangements with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. Interest expense for 2015 includes full-year interest on all of our long-term debt obligations issued in April 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes-For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized income before provision for income taxes of $65 million, compared to a loss before provision for income taxes of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The provision for income taxes was $52 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily driven by increased profits in certain jurisdictions in which we operate (primarily Saudi Arabia and Australia). In addition, we were able to utilize past losses in certain jurisdictions which were previously un-benefited to offset our improving income (primarily Saudi Arabia and Singapore).\nOur effective tax rate for 2015 and 2014 was 80% and (54)%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily driven by increased profits in certain jurisdictions in which we operate (mainly Saudi Arabia and Australia), a valuation allowance against losses in tax jurisdictions where we do not expect to receive a tax benefit, and taxes on unremitted earnings in jurisdictions where we do not have plans to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. This resulted in an increase in our overall effective tax rate. See Note 15, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the rate reconciliation table.\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates increased by $14 million from an $8 million loss in 2014 to a $22 million loss in 2015, primarily due to increased operating losses on the joint ventures Qingdao McDermott Wuchuan Offshore, io Oil & Gas and THHE Fabricators Sdn. Bhd.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest-Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $9 million and $11 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to our acquisition of our partner's interest in our North Ocean joint venture related to the NO 102, partially offset by increased income from two of our consolidated affiliates.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), generally using historical U.S. dollar accounting ( historical cost\u201d). Statements based on historical cost, however, do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar, especially during times of significant and continued inflation.\nIn order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations, we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor, material and service costs either through an estimate of those changes, which we reflect in the original price, or through price escalation clauses in our contracts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary ongoing sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand. We regularly review our sources and uses of funds and may access capital markets to increase our liquidity position or to refinance our existing debt. We plan to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements with cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, or a combination thereof.\nManagement believes, based on our current financial condition and existing and expected backlog, that our cash flows from operations and the sources of liquidity and capital resources described below will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $612 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash compared to $782 million as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, we had $75 million of cash in jurisdictions outside the U.S., principally in Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico and Qatar. Approximately 4% of our outstanding cash balance is held in countries that have established government imposed currency restrictions that could impede the ability of our subsidiary to transfer funds to us.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $16 million, compared to $117 million as of December 31, 2015. The amounts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 include $16 million and $102 million, respectively, of cash collateral for letters of credit that generally may be replaced with letters of credit under the LC Facility.\nCash Flow Activities\nOperating activities-Net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $178 million, $55 million and $7 million, respectively.\nThe cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected our net income (loss), adjusted for non-cash items and changes in components of our working capital-accounts receivable, contracts in progress net of advance billings on contracts, and accounts payable. Fluctuations in working capital are normal in our business. Working capital is impacted by the size of our projects and the achievement of billing milestones on backlog as we complete certain phases of the project.\nWe believe our anticipated future operating cash flow, capacity under our credit facilities and uncommitted bilateral lines of credit, along with access to surety bonds will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, settle our commitments and contingencies and address our working capital needs in the foreseeable future.\nIn the first half of 2015, we reached agreements with a representative we previously utilized in our Middle East operations and certain of its affiliates and associates regarding: (1) the value and timing of payment of ongoing future amounts that were to be paid under a representation agreement that we elected to allow to expire, with respect to: (a) commissions on customer contracts that we had entered into prior to such expiration; and (b) future commissions payable on customer contracts we expected to enter into during a specified post-expiration period under the representation agreement (pursuant to provisions that provided for commissions to be payable on customer contracts entered into during such post-expiration period); and (2) our repurchase of shares of capital stock in one of our subsidiaries previously held by them. Under these agreements, we agreed to make a series of payments in respect of the commissions that were expected to become due and payable under the prior arrangement. We paid approximately $21 million in March 2015, $26 million in April 2015 and $4 million in the second half of 2015 in connection with these agreements.\nInvesting activities-Our net cash used in investing activities was $231 million, $96 million and $245 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash used in 2016 primarily related to the construction of the Deepwater Lay Vessel 2000 ( DLV 2000\u201d), and was incurred as a result of the construction work reaching established milestones, including completion in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe change in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures. A lower level of capital spending in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the delay in completion of our DLV 2000, resulting from deferrals of milestone payments, and lower payments in 2015 for our CSV 108 vessel, which was completed and put in service in the first quarter of 2015.\nProceeds from disposition of assets provided cash of $2 million, $11 million and $72 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFinancing activities-Our net cash used in financing activities was $116 million and $28 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was $951 million.\nNet cash used in 2016 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of $75 million under the Term Loan discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, and $16 million and $8 million of repayments related to the Amortizing Notes comprising part of TEUs described below under Credit Agreement and Debt\u201d and NO 105 construction financing, respectively.\nNet cash used in 2015 was primarily attributable to $15 million and $8 million of repayments related to the Amortizing Notes and NO 105 construction financing, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was primarily attributable to the financing transactions completed in April 2014, as discussed in Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash provided was partially offset by:\n \u2022 our exercise, in October 2014, of our option to purchase the interest of our joint venture partner, Oceanteam Shipping ASA, in the NO 102 vessel-owning entities, at a net cost of approximately $33 million. We completed the acquisition of the additional interest in December 2014; and \n \u2022 a $6 million distribution to noncontrolling interests. \nCredit Agreement and Debt\nIn April 2014 we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which initially provided for a $400 million first-lien, first-out three-year letter of credit facility (the LC Facility\u201d), scheduled to mature in 2017, and a $300 million first-lien, second-out five-year term loan (the Term Loan\u201d), scheduled to mature in 2019. We also completed the issuance of (a) $500 million of second-lien, seven-year, senior secured notes; and (b) $288 million of tangible equity units ( TEUs\u201d) composed of (1) three-year amortizing, senior unsecured notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $48 million, and (2) prepaid common stock purchase contracts.\nIn October 2015, we entered into an amendment which amended the Credit Agreement primarily to increase the existing LC Facility from $400 million to $520 million.\nIn February 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit us to add to Covenant EBITDA certain cash restructuring expenses related to the conclusion of MPI or implementation of AOR for the quarters ending on or after March 31, 2016 but before April 16, 2017, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million (as of any date of determination).\nOn April 18, 2016, we entered into another amendment to the Credit Agreement, which, among other things:\n \u2022 replaced the existing EBITDA covenant with new ratios as follows: \n \u2022 a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 1.15x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each fiscal quarter thereafter; \n \u2022 a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 4.5x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each subsequent fiscal quarter through June 30, 2017, 4.0x for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, and 3.5x for each fiscal quarter thereafter; and \n \u2022 a maximum secured leverage ratio (as defined in the amendment) of 2.0x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 and each subsequent fiscal quarter through December 31, 2017, and 1.5x for each fiscal quarter thereafter; \n \u2022 amended the maximum capital expenditure covenant to limit capital expenditures in 2016 and thereafter to $250 million each fiscal year, with any prior fiscal year unused capital expenditures up to $125 million able to be carried forward and added to the next year's capital expenditure capacity, for a total of $375 million; \n \u2022 extended the maturity date of the LC Facility commitments; \n \u2022 changed the existing letter of credit capacity to $450 million; \n \u2022 extended the deadline for mortgaging the DLV 2000 to one year after taking delivery thereof, and gave McDermott the option to consider potential financing options for the DLV 2000 during that period; \n \u2022 increased the basket for purchase money indebtedness to $150 million; \n \u2022 modified the covenant limiting acquisitions to permit up to $150 million of acquisitions; and \n \u2022 modified the covenant limiting the prepayment or purchase of junior priority debt to permit up to $100 million of such prepayments or purchases. \nOn May 12, 2016, we entered into a further amendment to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, increased the applicable margin payable on the Term Loan by 3.0% per annum and requires that the net cash proceeds of any sale (including a sale and leaseback) of the DLV 2000 be applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loan.\nOn May 13, 2016, we prepaid $75 million of the Term Loan and satisfied the other conditions to the effective date\u201d set forth in the last amendment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, as shown below:\n\nCalculation of ratios under the Credit Agreement, as amended, requires us to compute consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted ( Covenant EBITDA\u201d). Covenant EBITDA is not a substitute for or superior to, operating income, net income, operating cash flow and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S GAAP. Covenant EBITDA has a specific definition per the Credit Agreement and will differ in the method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following reconciliation shows the calculation of Covenant EBITDA based on net income (loss) for each of the periods presented:\n\nAs of December 31, 2016 we had $442 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the LC Facility and $753 million of total debt, including current maturities, net of debt issuance costs of $14 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 we had $359 million of outstanding bank guarantees issued under uncommitted lines of credit and $79 million of surety bonds issued under general agreements of indemnity.\nSee Note 10, Debt, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our credit facilities and other indebtness.\nCapital Expenditures\nAs part of our strategic growth program, our management regularly evaluates our marine vessel fleet and our fabrication yard construction capacity to ensure our fleet and construction capabilities are adequately aligned with our overall growth strategy. These assessments may result in capital expenditures to construct, upgrade, acquire or operate vessels or acquire or upgrade fabrication yards that would enhance or grow our technical capabilities, or may involve engaging in discussions to dispose of certain marine vessels or fabrication yards.\nCapital expenditures for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $228 million, $103 million and $321 million, respectively, discussed below:\n \u2022 2016 capital expenditures were primarily attributable to the construction of the DLV 2000, and were incurred as a result of the construction work reaching established milestones, including completion in the second quarter of 2016. \n \u2022 2015 capital expenditures were primarily attributable to the construction of the DLV 2000, as well as costs associated with upgrading the capabilities of other marine vessels. \n \u2022 2014 capital expenditures were primarily attributable to construction of the CSV 108, development of our Altamira, Mexico fabrication yard, and certain upgrades and equipment expenditures associated with other vessels in our marine fleet. The CSV 108 was substantially complete at December 31, 2014, and the vessel was put into service in February 2015. \nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2016. Certain amounts included in this table are based on some estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual and other obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because some estimates and assumptions are subjective.\n\n (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including capital lease obligations. Amounts do not include any deferred issuance costs and interest. \n (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. \n (3) Amounts represent future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more. \nWe have recorded a $61 million liability as of December 31, 2016 for unrecognized tax positions and the payment of related interest and penalties. Due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\nOur contingent commitments under letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds currently outstanding expire as follows:\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are presented in U.S. Dollars and prepared in accordance with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report.\nUse of Estimates-We use estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and variances could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Changes in project estimates generally exclude change orders and changes in scope, but may include, without limitation, unexpected changes in weather conditions, productivity, unanticipated vessel repair requirements, customer, subcontractor and supplier delays and other costs. We generally expect to experience a variety of unanticipated events, and some of these events can result in significant cost increases above cost amounts we previously estimated. As of December 31, 2016, we have provided for our estimated costs to complete on all of our ongoing contracts. However, it is possible that current estimates could change due to unforeseen events, which could result in adjustments to overall contract costs. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in material adjustments to operating results. See Note 3, Use of Estimates, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition-We generally recognize contract revenues and related costs on a percentage-of-completion method for individual contracts or combinations of contracts based on work performed, man hours, or a cost-to-cost method, as applicable to the activity involved.\nAt the outset of each project, we prepare a detailed analysis of our estimated cost to complete the project. Total estimated project costs, and resulting contract income, are affected by changes in the expected cost of materials and labor, productivity, vessel costs, scheduling and other factors. In order to record revenue and profits on these projects, we multiply the total estimated profit over the life of the project by the current percentage towards completion based on the appropriate units noted above. Estimated losses on a project are recorded in full in the period the loss becomes known.\nEstimated profit over the life of a project includes consideration of contract price, change orders, claims, costs incurred and estimated costs to complete. Change orders, which are a normal and recurring part of our business, can increase (sometimes substantially) the future scope and cost of a job. Revenue from unapproved change orders is generally recognized to the extent of the lesser of amounts we expect to recover or costs incurred. To the extent claims included in backlog are not resolved in our favor, there could be reductions in, or reversals of previously reported amounts of, revenues and profits, and charges against current earnings, which could be material.\nWe regularly review contract price and cost estimates as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit, proportionate to the job percentage of completion in the period, when those estimates are revised. External factors such as weather, customer requirements, timely availability of materials, productivity, and other factors outside of our control may affect the progress and estimated cost of a project's completion which could materially impact the timing and amount of our revenue and income recognition. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nLoss Contingencies- We record liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. We provide disclosure when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision or if such loss is not reasonably estimable. We have accrued our estimates of the probable losses associated with these matters and associated legal costs are generally recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. However, our losses are typically resolved over long periods of time and are often difficult to estimate due to various factors, including the possibility of multiple actions by third parties. Therefore, it is possible future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates related to these matters.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans-We estimate income or expense related to our pension and postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial assumptions, including assumptions regarding discount rates and expected returns on plan assets adjusted for the current period actuarial gains and losses. We determine our discount rate based on a review of published financial data and discussions with our actuary regarding rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of our pension obligations. Based on historical data and discussions with our investment consultant, we determine our expected return on plan assets based on the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets and the market value of our plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the expected return of the various asset classes held in the plan, weighted by the target allocation of the plan's assets. Changes in these assumptions can result in significant changes in our estimated pension income or expense and our consolidated financial condition. We revise our assumptions annually based upon changes in current interest rates, return on plan assets and the underlying demographics of our workforce. These assumptions are reasonably likely to change in future periods and may have a material impact on future earnings.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for our pension plan.\n\nSee Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information on our pension plans.\nImpairment-We review our tangible long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation is required, the fair value of each applicable asset is compared to its carrying value. Factors that impact our determination of potential impairment include forecasted utilization of equipment and estimates of forecasted cash flows from projects expected to be performed in future periods. Our estimates of cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions or changes in operating performance. Any changes in such factors may negatively affect our business segments and result in future asset impairments.\nDeferred Taxes-We believe that our deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2016 are realizable through carrybacks, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If we subsequently determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, the resulting adjustment would increase earnings for the period in which such determination was made. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Any changes to our estimated valuation allowance could be material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See Note 15, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our deferred taxes.\nAccounting and Reporting Changes\nFor a discussion of the potential impact of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial

They have faced challenging market conditions due to low oil prices since 2014.\n- Revenue decreased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015, mainly due to lower activity on certain major projects. However, operating income improved due to strong project execution and cost management.\n- Backlog was $4.3 billion at the end of 2016. $3 billion is expected to turn into revenue in 2017.\n\nFinancial Performance\n- Operating income increased from $113 million in 2015 to $142 million in 2016 despite lower revenues. This reflects good project execution and cost savings initiatives.\n- Net income improved from a $52 million loss in 2015 to $40 million profit in 2016 thanks to higher operating income.\n- Entered into amendments to credit agreement in 2016 to ease financial covenants and provide more flexibility. Remain in compliance with covenants at the end of 2016.\n\nSegments\n- Americas, Europe and Africa revenues fell 40%, but operating losses narrowed due to better project execution.\n- Middle East revenues rose 9% and operating income improved 54% thanks to strong performance on key projects. \n- Asia revenues fell 24% but operating income only decreased slightly due to good project management.\n\nOutlook\n- Oil prices expected to continue affecting demand and pricing for services in the near term.\n- Focus remains on managing costs, improving efficiency, and positioning for growth when oil and gas spending rebounds.\n\nSo in summary, while market conditions remain challenging, McDermott improved financial performance in 2016 through good project execution and cost control. They remain focused on efficiency and managing through the downturn."}
