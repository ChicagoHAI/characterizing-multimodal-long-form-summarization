Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019, for a discussion of variance drivers for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017.\nDUKE ENERGY\nDuke Energy is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy's consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nExecutive Overview\nAt Duke Energy the fundamentals of our business are strong and allow us to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low-risk, predictable and transparent way. In 2019, we met our near-term financial commitments and positioned the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are focused on a business portfolio that will deliver a reliable dividend with 4% to 6% EPS growth through 2024. This growth is supported by our capital plan, timely cost-recovery mechanisms in most jurisdictions and our ability to manage our cost structure. The strength of our balance sheet is of vital importance to the cost-effective financing of our growth strategy, and in 2019 we continued to strengthen it by issuing $2 billion of preferred equity and $2.5 billion of common stock through a forward sales agreement which is expected to settle on or prior to December 31, 2020.\nFinancial Results\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>See Results of Operations below for Duke Energy's definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income available to Duke Energy and net income available to Duke Energy per diluted share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>DUKE ENERGY\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuke Energy's 2019 Net Income Available to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) were impacted by: favorable rate case and rider recovery outcomes, net of regulatory lag, and ongoing cost management efforts in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure; improved margins and increased ACP investment in Gas Utilities and Infrastructure; and growth in project investments in Commercial Renewables. See Results of Operations\u201d below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy's reportable business segments, as well as Other where financing costs increased in 2019 to fund segment operations and other liquidity needs.\n2019 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments\nOperational Excellence, Safety and Reliability. The reliable and safe operation of our power plants, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities is foundational to our customers, our financial results and our credibility with stakeholders. Our regulated generation fleet performance was strong throughout the year. All of our nuclear sites have achieved the industry's highest distinction rating. Our electric distribution system performed well throughout the year, with outage durations down when adjusted for storms. The safety of our workforce is a core value. Our employees delivered strong safety results in 2019, and we are at or near the top of our industry.\nStorm Response and System Restoration. The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season was the fourth consecutive year of above-average damaging storms. Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2019 storm response efforts is a testament to our team's extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and to on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts. Notably in 2019 Duke Energy earned EEI's Emergency Recovery Award, our 22nd EEI award since 1998 and a strong affirmation of the work of our employees to support customers when they need us most.\nCustomer Satisfaction. Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are the most important to the customer experience. In 2019, we instituted billing and payment-related communications and options, and we continue to enhance outage-related communications to customers.\nConstructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes. One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in our jurisdictions. Modernized constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. In 2019, Duke Energy, North Carolina regulators and environmentalists reached an agreement to permanently close all remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina. This agreement reduces the cost to close our coal ash basins for our Carolinas customers in comparison to the initial NCDEQ closure order. In 2019 we achieved constructive rate case outcomes driving earnings growth through rate base increases in South Carolina (electric), North Carolina (natural gas), Ohio (electric distribution) and Kentucky (natural gas). In addition, we have a multiyear rate plan in Florida and grid investment riders in the Midwest which enable more timely cost recovery and earnings growth.\nDigital Transformation. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity into the business. We continue to leverage new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape. In 2019, we created a team dedicated to developing applications and other solutions to deliver productivity gains and improvements to the customer experience.\nModernizing the Power Grid. Our grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for customers. In 2019, 79% of our jurisdictions were equipped with smart meters and we remain on track to be fully deployed across all regions by 2021. We continue to expand our self-optimizing grid capabilities, and in 2019 that saved over a half million customer interruptions.\nGenerating Cleaner Energy. Overall, we have lowered our carbon emissions by 39% since 2005, consistent with our new goal to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our commitment for 2030 includes retiring plants, operating our existing carbon-free resources and investing in natural gas infrastructure, renewables and our energy delivery system. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. That includes longer-term energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels.\nExpanding the Natural Gas Platform. We continue to pursue natural gas infrastructure investments. While the judicial and administrative challenges to date have been substantial, we are committed to the construction of the ACP pipeline to bring low-cost gas supply and economic development opportunities to the Southeast U.S. Construction is underway on a liquefied natural gas facility in Robeson County, North Carolina, on property Piedmont owns. This investment will help Piedmont provide a reliable gas supply to customers during peak usage periods and protect customers from price volatility when there is a higher-than-normal demand for natural gas.\nDividend Growth. In 2019, Duke Energy continued to grow the dividend payment to shareholders. 2019 represented the 93rd consecutive year Duke Energy paid a cash dividend on its common stock.\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>DUKE ENERGY\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuke Energy Objectives - 2020 and Beyond\nDuke Energy will continue to deliver exceptional value to customers, be an integral part of the communities in which we do business and provide attractive returns to investors. We have an achievable, long-term strategy in place, and it is producing tangible results, yet the industry in which we operate is becoming more and more dynamic. We are adjusting, where necessary, and accelerating our focus in key areas to ensure the company is well positioned to be successful for many decades into the future.

These items represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per-share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per-share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy's performance across periods.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings and Diluted EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively.\nSpecial items included in the periods presented include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impairment Charges in 2019 represents a reduction of a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC and an OTTI on the remaining investment in Constitution.

For Duke Energy's regulated operations, where the reduction in the net accumulated deferred income tax liability is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. This amount represents a true up of existing regulatory liabilities related to the Tax Act.

The increase in GAAP Reported earnings was primarily due to current year favorable rate case and rider recovery outcomes, an adjustment related to income tax recognition for equity method investments, growth in Commercial Renewables from new solar farms commencing commercial operations and prior year regulatory and legislative impacts, impairments, severance, loss on sale of a retired plant and costs to achieve merger. This favorability was partially offset by higher depreciation and higher financing costs in the current year. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years.\nAs discussed and shown in the table above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted diluted EPS. Duke Energy's adjusted diluted EPS was $5.06 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4.72 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy's operations is presented as Other. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments,\u201d for additional information on Duke Energy's segment structure.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>SEGMENT RESULTS -

The variance was driven primarily by higher debt outstanding in the current year and AFUDC debt return ending in the fourth quarter of 2018 on the Citrus County CC at Duke Energy Florida.\nIncome Tax Expense. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes, mostly offset by an increase in pretax income. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, were 18.2% and 20.7%, respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes.\nMatters Impacting Future Electric Utilities and Infrastructure Results\nOn December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina with ash moved to on-site lined landfills. At the two remaining basins, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nOn May 21, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress received orders from the PSCSC granting the companies' requests for retail rate increases but denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed notices of appeals with the South Carolina Supreme Court on November 15, 2019. Appellant briefs are due on March 2, 2020, and Appellee response briefs are due on May 15, 2020. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if coal ash costs are not ultimately approved for recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn June 22, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas received an order from the NCUC, which denied the Grid Rider Stipulation and deferral treatment of grid improvement costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in their 2019 rate cases. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nDuring the last half of 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida's service territories were impacted by several named storms. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages to the service territories of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Duke Energy Florida's service territory was also impacted by Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 hurricane and the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian impacted Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida's service territories. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the deferral and future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nIn 2019, Duke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC, and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed general rate cases with the NCUC. The outcome of these rate cases could materially impact Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn April 17, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. Duke Energy Indiana has interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. Duke Energy Indiana's interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to potential legal challenges and further regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Indiana's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>SEGMENT RESULTS - GAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of natural gas\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and other taxes\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>1,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income and Expenses, net\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax Expense\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Piedmont Local Distribution Company (LDC) throughput (Dth)\n</td> <td>511,243,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>557,145,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,901,354\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Midwest LDC throughput (MCF)\n</td> <td>89,025,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,604,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,578,861\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure's results were primarily impacted by higher equity earnings at ACP, the OTTI recorded on the Constitution investment and a 2019 adjustment related to the income tax recognition for equity method investments.

The variance was driven by higher debt outstanding in the current year and higher interest expense due to customers as a result of tax reform deferrals, partially offset by favorable AFUDC debt interest.\nIncome Tax Expense. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to an adjustment related to the income tax recognition for equity method\ninvestments, partially offset by an increase in pretax income. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, were 4.8% and 22.2%, respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to an adjustment related to the income tax recognition for equity method investments that was recorded during the first quarter of 2019 and current year AFUDC equity.

Affected states (West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina) have issued certain necessary permits; the project remains subject to other pending federal and state approvals, which will allow full construction activities to begin. In 2018, FERC issued a series of Notices to Proceed, which authorized the project to begin certain construction-related activities along the pipeline route. Given legal challenges and ongoing discussions with customers, ACP expects mechanical completion of the full project in late 2021 with in-service likely in the first half of 2022. The delays resulting from legal challenges have also impacted the cost for the project. Project cost is approximately $8 billion, excluding financing costs. This estimate is based on the current facts available around construction costs and timelines, and is subject to future changes as those facts develop. Abnormal weather, work delays (including delays due to judicial or regulatory action) and other conditions may result in cost or schedule modifications, a suspension of AFUDC for ACP and/or impairment charges potentially material to Duke Energy's cash flows, financial position and results of operations. ACP and Duke Energy will continue to consider their options with respect to the foregoing given their existing contractual and legal obligations. See Notes 4 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for additional information.\nOn November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an order authorizing recovery of MGP costs at certain sites in Ohio with a deadline to complete the MGP environmental investigation and remediation work prior to December 31, 2016. This deadline was subsequently extended to December 31, 2019. Duke Energy Ohio has filed a request for extension of the deadline. A hearing on that request has not been scheduled. Disallowance of costs incurred, failure to complete the work by the deadline or failure to obtain an extension from the PUCO could result in an adverse impact on Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

These assets were not impaired; however, a continued decline in energy market pricing would likely result in a future impairment. Impairment of these assets could result in adverse impacts to the future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Commercial Renewables.

At the one remaining basin, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Carolinas' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nDuke Energy Carolinas filed a general rate case with the NCUC on September 30, 2019. The outcome of this rate case could materially impact Duke Energy Carolina's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn May 21, 2019, the PSCSC issued an order granting Duke Energy Carolinas request for a retail rate increase but denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a notice of appeal with the South Carolina Supreme Court on November 15, 2019. Appellant briefs are due on March 2, 2020, and Appellee response briefs are due on May 15, 2020. Duke Energy Carolinas' results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if coal ash costs are not ultimately approved for recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn June 22, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas received an order from the NCUC, which denied the Grid Rider Stipulation and deferral treatment of grid improvement costs. Duke Energy Carolinas has petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in its 2019 rate case. Duke Energy Carolinas' results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nDuring the last half of 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas' service territory was impacted by several named storms. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages in the service territory. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the deferral and future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Carolinas' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

At the one remaining basin, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nDuke Energy Progress filed a general rate case with the NCUC on October 30, 2019. The outcome of this rate case could materially impact Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn May 21, 2019, the PSCSC issued an order granting Duke Energy Progress' request for a retail rate increase but denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Progress filed a notice of appeal with the South Carolina Supreme Court on November 15, 2019. Appellant briefs are due on March 2, 2020, and Appellee response briefs are due on May 15, 2020. Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if coal ash costs are not ultimately approved for recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nDuke Energy Progress has petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in its 2019 rate case. Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nDuring the last half of 2018, Duke Energy Progress' service territory was impacted by several named storms. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages in the service territory. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian reached the Carolinas bringing high winds, tornadoes and heavy rain, impacting about 300,000 customers within the service territory. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the deferral and future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA\nResults of Operations Table 259: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power\n</td> <td>2,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>1,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and other taxes\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>4,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income and Expenses, net\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax Expense\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Florida.

The storm caused significant damage within the service territory of Duke Energy Florida, particularly from Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach. In September 2019, Duke Energy Florida's service territory was threatened by Hurricane Dorian with landfall as a possible Category 5 hurricane and therefore Duke Energy Florida incurred costs to secure necessary resources to be prepared for that potential impact. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Florida's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Duke Energy Indiana has interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. Duke Energy Indiana's interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to potential legal challenges and further regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Indiana's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDuke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC on July 2, 2019, its first general rate case in Indiana in 16 years. The outcome of this rate case could materially impact Duke Energy Indiana's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Due to the margin decoupling mechanism in North Carolina, WNA mechanisms in South Carolina and Tennessee and fixed price contracts with most power generation customers, changes in throughput deliveries do not have a material impact on Piedmont's revenues or earnings. The margin decoupling mechanism adjusts for variations in residential and commercial use per customer, including those due to weather and conservation. The WNA mechanisms mostly offset the impact of weather on bills rendered, but do not ensure full recovery of approved margin during periods when winter weather is significantly warmer or colder than normal.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues.

Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations.\nManagement discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.\nFor further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulated Operations Accounting\nSubstantially all of Duke Energy's regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred.\nManagement continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as:\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>applicable regulatory environment changes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy's jurisdictions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>litigation of rate orders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>recent rate orders to other regulated entities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>levels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets.\nAs required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments\nDuke Energy performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all reporting units as of August 31, 2019. Additionally, Duke Energy monitors all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required. Such events and circumstances include an adverse regulatory outcome, declining financial performance and deterioration of industry or market conditions. As of August 31, 2019, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on Duke Energy's internal business plan. Significant assumptions used are growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rates. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the WACC for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2019 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2019, for each of Duke Energy's reporting units ranged from 5.2% to 5.9%. The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management's estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.\nOne of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer's primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31.\nDuke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy's regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity.\nFor further information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change.\nObligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2019, Duke Energy Florida, entered into an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station. Closing of this agreement is contingent upon approval of the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured using probability weightings of an obligation based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027 and an obligation based on the unit in SAFSTOR, with decommissioning beginning in 2067 and ending in 2074. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built DOE facility.\nObligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. During 2019, Duke Energy reached a settlement agreement with the NCDEQ and SELC to excavate 7 and partially excavate 2 of the remaining ash basins in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress service territories. In 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress remeasured their obligations to reflect the results of the settlement.\nFor further information, see Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated Operations\nDuke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value.\nPerforming an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.\nWhen determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.\nDuring 2019, Duke Energy sold a minority interest in a portion of certain Commercial Renewable assets. Following the sale, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of the assets included in the sale as the fair value of consideration received for the portfolio was less than the carrying value of the assets. It was determined the assets were all recoverable. Additionally, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of certain renewable merchant plants during 2019 due to declining market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices. It was determined the assets were all recoverable as the carrying value of the assets approximated the aggregate estimated future cash flows.\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor further information, see Notes 3 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Business Segments\" and \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\"\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value. If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.\nEvents or changes in circumstances are monitored that may indicate, in management's judgment, the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. The fair value of equity method investments is generally estimated using an income approach where significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows, the appropriate discount rate, and probability weighted-scenarios, if applicable. In certain instances, a market approach may also be used to estimate the fair value of the equity method investment.\nEvents or changes in circumstances that may be indicative of an other-than-temporary decline in value will vary by investment, but may include:\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant delays in or failure to complete significant growth projects of investees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adverse regulatory actions expected to substantially reduce the investee's product demand or profitability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected financial performance significantly worse than anticipated when initially invested;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Prolonged period the fair value is below carrying value;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A significant or sustained decline in the market value of an investee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lower than expected cash distributions from investees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 321: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant asset impairments or operating losses recognized by investees; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Loss of significant customers or suppliers with no immediate prospects for replacement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> ACP\nAs of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the equity method investment in ACP is $1.2 billion, and Duke Energy's maximum exposure to loss for its guarantee of the ACP revolving credit facility is $827 million. During 2018 and 2019, ACP received several adverse court rulings as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\" As a result, Duke Energy evaluated this investment for impairment and determined that fair value approximated carrying value and therefore no impairment was necessary.\nDuke Energy estimated the fair value of its investment in ACP using an income approach that primarily considered probability-weighted scenarios of discounted future net cash flows based on the most recent estimate of total construction costs and revenues. These scenarios included assumptions of various court decisions and the impact those decisions may have on the timing and extent of investment, including scenarios assuming the full resolution of permitting issues in addition to a scenario where the project does not proceed. Certain scenarios within the analysis included growth expectations from additional compression or other expansion opportunities and reopeners for pricing. An after-tax discount rate of 5.9% was used in the analysis. The discount rate was derived using a market participant approach with an adjusted risk premium for the underlying investment. Higher probabilities were generally assigned to those scenarios where court approvals were received and the project moves forward reflecting interim rates at prices subject to the reopeners. A low probability was assigned to the scenario where the project does not proceed.\nJudgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimates of future cash flows, discount rates, growth assumptions, and the likelihood of various scenarios. It is reasonably possible that future unfavorable developments, such as a reduced likelihood of success with court approvals, increased estimates of construction costs, material increases in the discount rate, important feedback on customer price increases or further significant delays, could result in a future impairment.\nFor further information on ACP, see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\".\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nThe calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are:\nTable 323: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 325: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the heath care cost trend rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amounts that are in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period. Prior service cost or credit, which represents an increase or decrease in a plan's pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period.\nTable 326: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.85%. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability. Real assets, return-seeking fixed income, hedge funds and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments.\nDuke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 3.3% as of December 31, 2019. Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2019, Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy's pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy's 2019 pretax pension expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25% change in rates were to occur.

As of December 31, 2019, the health care cost trend rate was 6.0%, trending down to 4.75% by 2026. These plans are closed to new employees.\nFor further information, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans.\u201d\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy's capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders.\nAmong other provisions, the Tax Act lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminated bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, the reduction in federal income taxes will result in lower regulated customer rates. However, due to its existing NOL position and other tax credits, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash tax payer through at least 2027. As a result, any reduction in customer rates could cause a material reduction in consolidated cash flows from operations in the short term. Over time, the reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Act will increase Duke Energy's regulated rate base investments and customer rates. Impacts of Tax Act to Duke Energy's cash flows and credit metrics are subject to the regulatory actions of its state commissions, of which a substantial amount remain uncertain through ongoing rate case activity, and the FERC. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters,\u201d for additional information.\nThe Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities,\u201d for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement.\nDuke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy's current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses.\nTable 328: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity Issuance\nIn order to strengthen its balance sheet and credit metrics and bolster cash flows, in November 2019, Duke Energy entered into forward sales agreements for $2.5 billion of common stock equity expected to be settled in late 2020. Duke Energy plans to issue $500 million of common stock equity per year through at least 2022 through the DRIP and ATM programs. Additionally, Duke Energy will utilize other instruments as needed. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Stockholders' Equity,\" for further information regarding Duke Energy's equity issuances in 2019.\nCredit Facilities and Registration Statements\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nDuke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors. Duke Energy's projected capital and investment expenditures, including AFUDC debt and capitalized interest, for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.

There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDuke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 65% and 75%, based upon adjusted diluted EPS, and expects this trend to continue through 2024. In 2019 and 2018, Duke Energy increased the dividend by approximately 2% and 4%, respectively, and the company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend.\nDividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters,\u201d Duke Energy's wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2019, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend does not exceed a material amount of Duke Energy's net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy's ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nCash flows from operations of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy's operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.\nTable 330: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d for additional information).\nAt December 31, 2019, Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $311 million.\nDEBT ISSUANCES\nDepending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.\nIn 2020, Duke Energy anticipates issuing additional debt of $5.2 billion, primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities. See to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding significant debt issuances in 2019.\nDuke Energy's capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. Table 331: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Projected 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nDuke Energy's debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of December 31, 2019, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.\nTable 332: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Ratings\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc. and S&P provide credit ratings for various Duke Energy Registrants.

The Duke Energy Registrants' credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies' assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes Duke Energy's cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.

These arrangements include performance guarantees, standby letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.\nMost of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Capital through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007, spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp, having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.\nDuke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications,\u201d for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy's operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIn November 2019, Duke Energy executed equity forward sales agreements. Settlement of the forward sales agreements are expected to occur on or prior to December 31, 2020. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Stockholders' Equity\u201d for further details on the equity forward sales agreements.\nOther than the guarantee arrangements discussed above, the equity forward sales agreements and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities\".\nTable 351: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nDuke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices.

Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.\nTable 364: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\nCommodity Price Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets. Duke Energy's exposure to these fluctuations is primarily limited by the cost-based regulation of its regulated operations as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations. Within Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment, the company has limited exposure to market price fluctuations in prices of energy-related products as a result of its ownership of renewable assets.\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy's exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging.\u201d\nHedging Strategies\nDuke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy's primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers. Additionally, Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables business may enter into short-term or long-term hedge agreements to manage price risk associated with project output.\nThe majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy's commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.\nDuke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract's fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.\nGeneration Portfolio Risks\nThe Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their generation portfolios, which include generation assets, fuel and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units.\nFor the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Debt and Credit Facilities,\u201d Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d and Fair Value Measurements.\u201d\nDuke Energy had $8.6 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2019. The impact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $86 million at December 31, 2019. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 365: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain Duke Energy Registrants have variable-rate debt and manage interest rate risk by entering into financial contracts including interest rate swaps. See Notes 7 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and \"Derivatives and Hedging.\" Such financial arrangements generally are indexed based upon LIBOR, which is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has been identified by regulators and industry participants as the preferred successor rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR at that time. Impacted financial arrangements extending beyond 2021 may require contractual amendment or termination and renegotiation to fully adapt to a post-LIBOR environment, and there may be uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative index methodologies. Alternative index provisions are being assessed and incorporated into new financial arrangements that extend beyond 2021. Additionally, the progress of the phaseout is being monitored, including proposed transition relief from the FASB.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits.\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non-performance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Variable Interest Entities.\u201d Duke Energy also provides certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer credit worthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions.\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications,\u201d for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\nTable 366: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.\nMarketable Securities Price Risk\nAs described further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nPension Plan Assets\nDuke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets.\nA significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy's results of operations in those periods.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\nAs required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2019, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes.\nAccounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations,\u201d for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d for additional information regarding NDTF assets.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCoal Combustion Residuals\nIn April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. Various industry and environmental parties appealed EPA's CCR rule in the D.C. Circuit Court. On April 18, 2016, EPA filed a motion with the federal court to settle five issues raised in litigation. On June 14, 2016, the court approved the motion with respect to all of those issues. Duke Energy does not expect a material impact from the settlement or that it will result in additional ARO adjustments. On September 13, 2017, EPA responded to a petition by the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group that the agency would reconsider certain provisions of the final rule, and asked the D.C. Circuit Court to suspend the litigation. The D.C. Circuit Court denied EPA's petition to suspend the litigation and oral argument was held on November 20, 2017. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision in the CCR rule litigation denying relief for industry petitioners' remaining claims and ruling in favor of environmental petitioners on a number of their challenges, including the regulation of inactive CCR surface impoundments at retired plants and the continued operation of unlined impoundments.\nTable 367: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>OTHER MATTERS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn March 15, 2018, EPA published proposed amendments to the federal CCR rule, including revisions that were required as part of the CCR litigation settlement, as well as changes that the agency considered warranted due to the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provides statutory authority for state and federal CCR permit programs. On July 17, 2018, EPA issued a rule (Phase 1, Part 1) finalizing certain, but not all, elements included in the agency's March 15, 2018, proposal. The final rule revises certain closure deadlines and groundwater protection standards in the CCR rule. It does not change the primary requirements for groundwater monitoring, corrective action, inspections and maintenance, and closure, and thus does not materially affect Duke Energy's coal ash basin closure plans or compliance obligations under the CCR rule. On October 22, 2018, a coalition of environmental groups filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging EPA's final Phase 1, Part 1 revisions to the CCR rule. On March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an order in the Phase 1, Part 1 litigation granting EPA's motion to remand the rule without vacatur. EPA is currently conducting multiple notice-and-comment rulemakings to implement the court's decision on remand.\nIn addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by most states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy's regulated operations. For more information, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\nCoal Ash Management Act of 2014\nAROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions.\nConsistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy previously submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective plans to NCDEQ. In addition, on December 31, 2019, Duke Energy submitted updated groundwater corrective action plans and site-specific coal ash impoundment closure plans to NCDEQ.\nOn April 1, 2019, NCDEQ issued a closure determination requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to excavate all remaining coal ash impoundments at the Allen, Belews Creek, Rogers, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro facilities in North Carolina. On April 26, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed Petitions for Contested Case Hearings in the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge NCDEQ's April 1 Order. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins at these sites with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Belews Creek, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the two remaining basins at Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will not be disturbed and will be closed pursuant to other state regulations. For more information, see Note 5, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFollowing NCDEQ's April 1 Order, Duke Energy estimated the incremental undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining impoundments by excavation would be approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, potentially increasing the total estimated costs to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina to $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. The settlement lowers the estimated total undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining basins by excavation by approximately $1.5 billion as compared to Duke Energy's original estimate that followed the order. As a result, the estimated total cost to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina is now approximately $8 billion to $9 billion, of which approximately $2.3 billion has been spent through 2019. The majority of the remaining spend is expected to occur over the next 15-20 years. Duke Energy intends to seek recovery of all costs through the ratemaking process consistent with previous proceedings.\nIn 2019, Duke Energy completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend and Dan River plants and coal ash regulated by the Coal Ash Act at the Sutton plant.\nFor further information on ash basins and recovery, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Asset Retirement Obligations,\u201d respectively.\nTable 368: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>OTHER MATTERS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimated Cost and Impacts of Rulemakings\nDuke Energy will incur capital expenditures to comply with the environmental regulations and rules discussed above. The following table, as of December 31, 2019, provides five-year estimated costs, excluding AFUDC, of new control equipment that may need to be installed on existing power plants primarily to comply with the Coal Ash Act requirements for conversion to dry disposal of bottom ash and fly ash, CWA 316(b) and Effluent Limitations Guidelines through December 31, 2024. The table excludes ash basin closure costs recorded in Asset retirement obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information related to AROs, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table 369: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Five-Year Estimated Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Carolinas\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Progress Energy\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Progress\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Florida\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Ohio\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Indiana\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance and other expenses, in addition to costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements, as a result of these regulations. Actual compliance costs incurred may be materially different from these estimates due to reasons such as the timing and requirements of EPA regulations and the resolution of legal challenges to the rules. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek rate recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with regulated operations to comply with these regulations.\nOther Environmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters, including the following:\nTable 370: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Clean Water Act\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Steam Effluent Limitation Guidelines\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 372: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cross-State Air Pollution Rule\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 373: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Clean Power Plan/ACE Rule\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Duke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nSection 126 Petitions\nOn November 16, 2016, the state of Maryland filed a petition with EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act alleging that 19 power plants, including two plants (three units) that Duke Energy Registrants own and operate, contribute to violations of EPA's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone in the state of Maryland. On March 12, 2018, the state of New York filed a petition with EPA, also under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act alleging that over 60 power plants, including six that Duke Energy Registrants own and operate, contribute to violations of EPA's ozone NAAQS in the state of New York. Both Maryland and New York sought EPA orders requiring the states in which the named power plants operate impose more stringent NOx emission limitations on the plants. On October 5, 2018, EPA denied the Maryland petition. That same day, Maryland appealed EPA's denial, On October 18, 2019, EPA denied the New York petition, and New York appealed that decision on October 29, 2019. Both appeals are before the D.C. Circuit Court. The impact of these petitions could be more stringent requirements for the operation of NOx emission controls at these plants. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nGlobal Climate Change\nOn September 17, 2019, Duke Energy announced an updated climate strategy with a new goal of net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. Timelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, will vary in each state in which the company operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' GHG emissions consist primarily of CO2 and result primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. In 2019, the Duke Energy Registrants' power plants emitted approximately 93 million tons of CO2. Future levels of CO2 emissions will be influenced by variables that include fuel prices, market prices, compliance with new or existing regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand and the technologies deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet the customer demand.\nTable 374: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>OTHER MATTERS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO2 emissions over time. Actions have included the retirement of 47 coal-fired Electric Generating Units with a combined generating capacity of 5,425 MW. Much of that capacity has been replaced with state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated. Duke Energy also has made investments to expand its portfolio of wind and solar projects, increase EE offerings and invest in its zero-CO2 emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO2 emissions. Between 2005 and 2019, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO2 emissions from their electricity generation by 39%, which potentially lowers the exposure to any future mandatory CO2 emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement. Duke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce CO2 emissions, including EE, wind, solar, storage and nuclear. Duke Energy will adjust to evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability that customers expect. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO2 limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants' operations impossible.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IRPs. These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the company's thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, EE and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.\nFor a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price on CO2 emissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential regulation of CO2 emissions. Incorporating a price on CO2 emissions in the IRPs allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One of the challenges with using a CO2 price, especially in the absence of a clear and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants typically use a range of potential CO2 prices to reflect a range of potential policy outcomes.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems by modernizing the electric grid through smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding and applying lessons learned from previous storms to restoration efforts. The Duke Energy Registrants' electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on-site to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity.\nState Legislation\nIn July 2017, the North Carolina General Assembly passed House Bill 589, and it was subsequently signed into law by the governor. The law includes, among other things, overall reform of the application of PURPA for new solar projects in the state, a requirement for the utility to procure approximately 2,600 MW of renewable energy through a competitive bidding process and recovery of costs related to the competitive bidding process through the fuel clause and a competitive procurement rider.\nIn accordance with the provisions of HB 589, total procurement was changed based upon how much generation with no economic dispatch or curtailment occurs over the procurement period. Most of this type of generation is solar procured under PURPA. Based upon the current forecasted amount of such generation that will occur over procurement period, Duke Energy estimates the total under HB 589 competitive procurement will be approximately 1,500 to 2,000 MW.\nBased on an independent evaluation process, Duke Energy will own or purchase a total of 551 MW of renewable energy from projects under the North Carolina's CPRE program. The process used was approved by the NCUC to select projects that would deliver the lowest cost renewable energy for customers. Five Duke Energy projects, totaling about 190 MW, were selected during the competitive bidding process. Duke Energy has completed the contracting process for the winning projects. A second tranche for CPRE opened in October 2019 and bids are due by March 9, 2020; the current target date for execution of the contracts is the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn various states, legislation is being considered to allow third-party sales of electricity. Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these initiatives.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP in the U.S., as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS discussed below. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy's consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nExecutive Overview\nAt Duke Energy the fundamentals of our business are strong and allow us to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low-risk, predictable and transparent way. In 2019, we met our near-term financial commitments and positioned the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are focused on a business portfolio that will deliver a reliable dividend with 4% to 6% EPS growth through 2024. This growth is supported by our capital plan, timely cost-recovery mechanisms in most jurisdictions and our ability to manage our cost structure. The strength of our balance sheet is of vital importance to the cost-effective financing of our growth strategy, and in 2019 we continued to strengthen it by issuing $2 billion of preferred equity and $2.5 billion of common stock through a forward sales agreement which is expected to settle on or prior to December 31, 2020.\nFinancial Results\n (a) See Results of Operations below for Duke Energy's definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income available to Duke Energy and net income available to Duke Energy per diluted share. \n MD&A DUKE ENERGY \nDuke Energy's 2019 Net Income Available to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) were impacted by: favorable rate case and rider recovery outcomes, net of regulatory lag, and ongoing cost management efforts in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure; improved margins and increased ACP investment in Gas Utilities and Infrastructure; and growth in project investments in Commercial Renewables. See Results of Operations\u201d below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy's reportable business segments, as well as Other where financing costs increased in 2019 to fund segment operations and other liquidity needs.\n2019 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments\nOperational Excellence, Safety and Reliability. The reliable and safe operation of our power plants, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities is foundational to our customers, our financial results and our credibility with stakeholders. Our regulated generation fleet performance was strong throughout the year. All of our nuclear sites have achieved the industry's highest distinction rating. Our electric distribution system performed well throughout the year, with outage durations down when adjusted for storms. The safety of our workforce is a core value. Our employees delivered strong safety results in 2019, and we are at or near the top of our industry.\nStorm Response and System Restoration. The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season was the fourth consecutive year of above-average damaging storms. Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2019 storm response efforts is a testament to our team's extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and to on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts. Notably in 2019 Duke Energy earned EEI's Emergency Recovery Award, our 22nd EEI award since 1998 and a strong affirmation of the work of our employees to support customers when they need us most.\nCustomer Satisfaction. Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are the most important to the customer experience. In 2019, we instituted billing and payment-related communications and options, and we continue to enhance outage-related communications to customers.\nConstructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes. One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in our jurisdictions. Modernized constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. In 2019, Duke Energy, North Carolina regulators and environmentalists reached an agreement to permanently close all remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina. This agreement reduces the cost to close our coal ash basins for our Carolinas customers in comparison to the initial NCDEQ closure order. In 2019 we achieved constructive rate case outcomes driving earnings growth through rate base increases in South Carolina (electric), North Carolina (natural gas), Ohio (electric distribution) and Kentucky (natural gas). In addition, we have a multiyear rate plan in Florida and grid investment riders in the Midwest which enable more timely cost recovery and earnings growth.\nDigital Transformation. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity into the business. We continue to leverage new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape. In 2019, we created a team dedicated to developing applications and other solutions to deliver productivity gains and improvements to the customer experience.\nModernizing the Power Grid. Our grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for customers. In 2019, 79% of our jurisdictions were equipped with smart meters and we remain on track to be fully deployed across all regions by 2021. We continue to expand our self-optimizing grid capabilities, and in 2019 that saved over a half million customer interruptions.\nGenerating Cleaner Energy. Overall, we have lowered our carbon emissions by 39% since 2005, consistent with our new goal to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our commitment for 2030 includes retiring plants, operating our existing carbon-free resources and investing in natural gas infrastructure, renewables and our energy delivery system. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. That includes longer-term energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels.\nExpanding the Natural Gas Platform. We continue to pursue natural gas infrastructure investments. While the judicial and administrative challenges to date have been substantial, we are committed to the construction of the ACP pipeline to bring low-cost gas supply and economic development opportunities to the Southeast U.S. Construction is underway on a liquefied natural gas facility in Robeson County, North Carolina, on property Piedmont owns. This investment will help Piedmont provide a reliable gas supply to customers during peak usage periods and protect customers from price volatility when there is a higher-than-normal demand for natural gas.\nDividend Growth. In 2019, Duke Energy continued to grow the dividend payment to shareholders. 2019 represented the 93rd consecutive year Duke Energy paid a cash dividend on its common stock.\n MD&A DUKE ENERGY \nDuke Energy Objectives - 2020 and Beyond\nDuke Energy will continue to deliver exceptional value to customers, be an integral part of the communities in which we do business and provide attractive returns to investors. We have an achievable, long-term strategy in place, and it is producing tangible results, yet the industry in which we operate is becoming more and more dynamic. We are adjusting, where necessary, and accelerating our focus in key areas to ensure the company is well positioned to be successful for many decades into the future. As we look ahead to 2020, our plans include:\n \u2022 Continuing to place the customer at the center of all that we do which includes providing customized products and solutions \n \u2022 Strengthening our relationships with all our vast stakeholders in the communities in which we operate and invest \n \u2022 Generating cleaner energy and working to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 \n \u2022 Maintaining the safety of our communities and employees \n \u2022 Modernizing and strengthening the energy grid \n \u2022 Expanding the natural gas infrastructure \n \u2022 Deploying digital tools across our business  Results of Operations\nNon-GAAP Measures\nManagement evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. These items represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per-share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per-share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy's performance across periods.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings and Diluted EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively.\nSpecial items included in the periods presented include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:\n \u2022 Impairment Charges in 2019 represents a reduction of a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC and an OTTI on the remaining investment in Constitution. For 2018, it represents an impairment at Citrus County CC, a goodwill impairment at Commercial Renewables and an OTTI of an investment in Constitution. \n \u2022 Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from strategic acquisitions. \n \u2022 Regulatory and Legislative Impacts in 2018 represents charges related to the Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas North Carolina rate case orders and the repeal of the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. \n \u2022 Sale of Retired Plant represents the loss associated with selling Beckjord, a nonregulated generating facility in Ohio. \n \u2022 Impacts of the Tax Act represents amounts recognized related to the Tax Act. \n \u2022 Severance Charges relate to companywide initiatives, excluding merger integration, to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and workforce optimization.  Duke Energy's adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.\n MD&A DUKE ENERGY \nReconciliation of GAAP Reported Amounts to Adjusted Amounts\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Net of tax benefit of $27 million and Noncontrolling Interests of $2 million in 2018. \n (b) Net of tax benefit of $19 million. \n (c) Net of tax benefit of $63 million. \n (d) Net of $25 million tax benefit. \n (e) The Tax Act reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As the tax change was enacted in 2017, Duke Energy was required to remeasure its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower rate at December 31, 2017. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, where the reduction in the net accumulated deferred income tax liability is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. This amount represents a true up of existing regulatory liabilities related to the Tax Act. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Income Taxes\" for more information. \n (f) Net of tax benefit of $43 million.  Year Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nGAAP Reported EPS was $5.06 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $3.76 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in GAAP Reported earnings was primarily due to current year favorable rate case and rider recovery outcomes, an adjustment related to income tax recognition for equity method investments, growth in Commercial Renewables from new solar farms commencing commercial operations and prior year regulatory and legislative impacts, impairments, severance, loss on sale of a retired plant and costs to achieve merger. This favorability was partially offset by higher depreciation and higher financing costs in the current year. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years.\nAs discussed and shown in the table above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted diluted EPS. Duke Energy's adjusted diluted EPS was $5.06 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4.72 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy's operations is presented as Other. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments,\u201d for additional information on Duke Energy's segment structure.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>SEGMENT RESULTS -

These drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation from a growing asset base and higher interest expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $603 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases and Duke Energy Florida's base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $45 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volumes.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $428 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to additional plant in service and new depreciation rates associated with the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases and Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC being placed in service; and \n \u2022 a $41 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to higher property taxes for additional plant in service at Duke Energy Florida and current year property tax reassessments at Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Ohio.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $317 million decrease in impairment charges primarily due to the impacts associated with the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases as well as impairment impacts related to Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC; and \n \u2022 a $134 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to lower payroll and benefit costs resulting from prior year workforce reductions and lower storm costs at Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas in the current year.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC equity return ending on the Citrus County CC in the fourth quarter of 2018 at Duke Energy Florida.\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>SEGMENT RESULTS - ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven primarily by higher debt outstanding in the current year and AFUDC debt return ending in the fourth quarter of 2018 on the Citrus County CC at Duke Energy Florida.\nIncome Tax Expense. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes, mostly offset by an increase in pretax income. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, were 18.2% and 20.7%, respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes.\nMatters Impacting Future Electric Utilities and Infrastructure Results\nOn December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina with ash moved to on-site lined landfills. At the two remaining basins, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nOn May 21, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress received orders from the PSCSC granting the companies' requests for retail rate increases but denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed notices of appeals with the South Carolina Supreme Court on November 15, 2019. Appellant briefs are due on March 2, 2020, and Appellee response briefs are due on May 15, 2020. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if coal ash costs are not ultimately approved for recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn June 22, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas received an order from the NCUC, which denied the Grid Rider Stipulation and deferral treatment of grid improvement costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in their 2019 rate cases. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nDuring the last half of 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida's service territories were impacted by several named storms. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages to the service territories of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Duke Energy Florida's service territory was also impacted by Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 hurricane and the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian impacted Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida's service territories. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the deferral and future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nIn 2019, Duke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC, and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed general rate cases with the NCUC. The outcome of these rate cases could materially impact Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn April 17, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. Duke Energy Indiana has interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. Duke Energy Indiana's interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to potential legal challenges and further regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash.

The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $70 million decrease due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers; and \n \u2022 a $13 million decrease due to rider revenues related to MGP and Accelerated Main Replacement Program.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $37 million increase due to North Carolina and Kentucky base rate case increases; \n \u2022 a $19 million increase due to North Carolina and Tennessee IMR increases; and \n \u2022 an $11 million increase due to NCUC approval related to tax reform accounting from fixed rate contracts.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $70 million decrease in the cost of natural gas due to lower natural gas prices.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $25 million increase in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to increased labor, benefits and information technology costs; and \n \u2022 an $11 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings at ACP as a result of higher cumulative project spending and a higher OTTI recorded on the Constitution investment in the prior year.\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven by higher debt outstanding in the current year and higher interest expense due to customers as a result of tax reform deferrals, partially offset by favorable AFUDC debt interest.\nIncome Tax Expense. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to an adjustment related to the income tax recognition for equity method\ninvestments, partially offset by an increase in pretax income. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, were 4.8% and 22.2%, respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to an adjustment related to the income tax recognition for equity method investments that was recorded during the first quarter of 2019 and current year AFUDC equity. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years.\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>SEGMENT RESULTS - GAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMatters Impacting Future Gas Utilities and Infrastructure Results\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 47% ownership interest in ACP, which is building an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets. Affected states (West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina) have issued certain necessary permits; the project remains subject to other pending federal and state approvals, which will allow full construction activities to begin. In 2018, FERC issued a series of Notices to Proceed, which authorized the project to begin certain construction-related activities along the pipeline route. Given legal challenges and ongoing discussions with customers, ACP expects mechanical completion of the full project in late 2021 with in-service likely in the first half of 2022. The delays resulting from legal challenges have also impacted the cost for the project. Project cost is approximately $8 billion, excluding financing costs. This estimate is based on the current facts available around construction costs and timelines, and is subject to future changes as those facts develop. Abnormal weather, work delays (including delays due to judicial or regulatory action) and other conditions may result in cost or schedule modifications, a suspension of AFUDC for ACP and/or impairment charges potentially material to Duke Energy's cash flows, financial position and results of operations. ACP and Duke Energy will continue to consider their options with respect to the foregoing given their existing contractual and legal obligations. See Notes 4 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for additional information.\nOn November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an order authorizing recovery of MGP costs at certain sites in Ohio with a deadline to complete the MGP environmental investigation and remediation work prior to December 31, 2016. This deadline was subsequently extended to December 31, 2019. Duke Energy Ohio has filed a request for extension of the deadline. A hearing on that request has not been scheduled. Disallowance of costs incurred, failure to complete the work by the deadline or failure to obtain an extension from the PUCO could result in an adverse impact on Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The decrease was primarily due to income from the FES settlement agreement in the prior year.\nIncome Tax Benefit. The decrease in the tax benefit was primarily driven by taxes associated with Duke Energy's interest in tax equity solar projects recorded during 2019 and a reduction in PTCs generated.\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>SEGMENT RESULTS - COMMERCIAL RENEWABLES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The variance was primarily due to an increase in solar projects with tax equity investors. HLBV accounting was utilized, resulting in allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interest partners. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for more information.\nMatters Impacting Future Commercial Renewables Results\nCommercial Renewables continues to experience growth with tax equity projects; however, the future expiration of federal tax incentives could result in adverse impacts to future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDuring 2019, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of its renewable merchant plants principally in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas West market, due to declining market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices, primarily driven by lower forecasted natural gas prices. These assets were not impaired; however, a continued decline in energy market pricing would likely result in a future impairment. Impairment of these assets could result in adverse impacts to the future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Commercial Renewables.

The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $366 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to the impacts of the prior year North Carolina rate case and current year South Carolina rate case at Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida's base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service and annual increases from the 2017 Settlement Agreement; \n \u2022 a $70 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of fuel, primarily due to coal ash cost recovery in the current year at Duke Energy Progress and increased demand at Duke Energy Florida; \n \u2022 a $42 million increase in fuel revenues primarily related to increased fuel cost recovery due to extreme weather in the prior year at Duke Energy Progress, partially offset by a decrease in fuel and capacity rates billed to retail customers at Duke Energy Florida; \n \u2022 a $22 million increase in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to favorable weather in the current year at Duke Energy Florida; and \n \u2022 a $21 million increase in other revenues primarily due to increased transmission revenues and nonregulated products and services revenues at Duke Energy Florida.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $47 million decrease in retail rider revenues primarily related to decreased revenue requirements in the current year; and \n \u2022 a $14 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volumes at Duke Energy Florida.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $226 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to higher amortization of deferred coal ash costs, new depreciation rates associated with the prior year Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate case and Duke Energy Florida's base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service; \n \u2022 a $48 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to an increase in the North Carolina Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard requirement from the prior year at Duke Energy Progress, partially offset by lower purchased power and lower fuel costs, net of deferrals, at Duke Energy Florida; and \n \u2022 a $32 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to current year property tax reassessments and a favorable sales and use tax credit in the prior year at Duke Energy Progress and higher property taxes for additional plant in service at Duke Energy Florida.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $118 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to lower storm costs, reduced outage costs, and lower employee benefit costs, partially offset by increased vegetation management costs at Duke Energy Florida; and \n \u2022 a $111 million decrease in impairment charges primarily due to prior year impacts associated with the North Carolina rate case at Duke Energy Progress as well as the impairment of Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC equity return ending on the Citrus County CC in the fourth quarter of 2018 at Duke Energy Florida, partially offset by life insurance proceeds at Duke Energy Progress.\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC debt return ending in the fourth quarter of 2018 on the Citrus County CC at Duke Energy Florida.\nIncome Tax Expense. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes and a Tax Act adjustment in the prior year related to excess deferred taxes.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nOn December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate two of the three remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina with ash moved to on-site lined landfills.

Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $74 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service, other additional plant in service and increases resulting from the 2018 Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear decommissioning cost study; \n \u2022 an $18 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to higher property taxes from additional plant in service; and \n \u2022 a $9 million increase in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to increased vegetation management costs and deregulation initiative costs, partially offset by lower severance charges.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC equity return ending on the Citrus County CC in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC debt return ending on the Citrus County CC in the fourth quarter of 2018 and higher debt outstanding in the current year.\nIncome Tax Expense. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income in the current year.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nOn October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall on Florida's Panhandle as a Category 5 hurricane, the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. The storm caused significant damage within the service territory of Duke Energy Florida, particularly from Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach. In September 2019, Duke Energy Florida's service territory was threatened by Hurricane Dorian with landfall as a possible Category 5 hurricane and therefore Duke Energy Florida incurred costs to secure necessary resources to be prepared for that potential impact. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Florida's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Duke Energy Indiana has interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. Duke Energy Indiana's interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to potential legal challenges and further regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Indiana's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDuke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC on July 2, 2019, its first general rate case in Indiana in 16 years. The outcome of this rate case could materially impact Duke Energy Indiana's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Due to the margin decoupling mechanism in North Carolina, WNA mechanisms in South Carolina and Tennessee and fixed price contracts with most power generation customers, changes in throughput deliveries do not have a material impact on Piedmont's revenues or earnings. The margin decoupling mechanism adjusts for variations in residential and commercial use per customer, including those due to weather and conservation. The WNA mechanisms mostly offset the impact of weather on bills rendered, but do not ensure full recovery of approved margin during periods when winter weather is significantly warmer or colder than normal.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues.

The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $52 million decrease in cost of natural gas due to lower natural gas prices; and \n \u2022 a $29 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense due to lower information technology outside services and labor costs.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $13 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service. \nMatters Impacting Future Results\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nPreparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations, cash flows or the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations.\nManagement discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.\nFor further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulated Operations Accounting\nSubstantially all of Duke Energy's regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred.\nManagement continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as:\n \u2022 applicable regulatory environment changes; \n \u2022 historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy's jurisdictions; \n \u2022 litigation of rate orders; \n \u2022 recent rate orders to other regulated entities; \n \u2022 levels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity; and \n \u2022 the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets.\nAs required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments\nDuke Energy performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all reporting units as of August 31, 2019. Additionally, Duke Energy monitors all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required. Such events and circumstances include an adverse regulatory outcome, declining financial performance and deterioration of industry or market conditions. As of August 31, 2019, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.\n MD&A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \nEstimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on Duke Energy's internal business plan. Significant assumptions used are growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rates. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the WACC for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2019 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2019, for each of Duke Energy's reporting units ranged from 5.2% to 5.9%. The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management's estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.\nOne of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer's primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31.\nDuke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy's regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity.\nFor further information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change.\nObligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2019, Duke Energy Florida, entered into an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station. Closing of this agreement is contingent upon approval of the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured using probability weightings of an obligation based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027 and an obligation based on the unit in SAFSTOR, with decommissioning beginning in 2067 and ending in 2074. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built DOE facility.\nObligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. During 2019, Duke Energy reached a settlement agreement with the NCDEQ and SELC to excavate 7 and partially excavate 2 of the remaining ash basins in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress service territories. In 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress remeasured their obligations to reflect the results of the settlement.\nFor further information, see Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated Operations\nDuke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value.\nPerforming an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.\nWhen determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.\nDuring 2019, Duke Energy sold a minority interest in a portion of certain Commercial Renewable assets. Following the sale, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of the assets included in the sale as the fair value of consideration received for the portfolio was less than the carrying value of the assets. It was determined the assets were all recoverable. Additionally, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of certain renewable merchant plants during 2019 due to declining market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices. It was determined the assets were all recoverable as the carrying value of the assets approximated the aggregate estimated future cash flows.\n MD&A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \nFor further information, see Notes 3 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Business Segments\" and \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\"\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value. If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.\nEvents or changes in circumstances are monitored that may indicate, in management's judgment, the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. The fair value of equity method investments is generally estimated using an income approach where significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows, the appropriate discount rate, and probability weighted-scenarios, if applicable. In certain instances, a market approach may also be used to estimate the fair value of the equity method investment.\nEvents or changes in circumstances that may be indicative of an other-than-temporary decline in value will vary by investment, but may include:\n \u2022 Significant delays in or failure to complete significant growth projects of investees; \n \u2022 Adverse regulatory actions expected to substantially reduce the investee's product demand or profitability; \n \u2022 Expected financial performance significantly worse than anticipated when initially invested; \n \u2022 Prolonged period the fair value is below carrying value; \n \u2022 A significant or sustained decline in the market value of an investee; \n \u2022 Lower than expected cash distributions from investees; \n \u2022 Significant asset impairments or operating losses recognized by investees; and \n \u2022 Loss of significant customers or suppliers with no immediate prospects for replacement.  ACP\nAs of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the equity method investment in ACP is $1.2 billion, and Duke Energy's maximum exposure to loss for its guarantee of the ACP revolving credit facility is $827 million. During 2018 and 2019, ACP received several adverse court rulings as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\" As a result, Duke Energy evaluated this investment for impairment and determined that fair value approximated carrying value and therefore no impairment was necessary.\nDuke Energy estimated the fair value of its investment in ACP using an income approach that primarily considered probability-weighted scenarios of discounted future net cash flows based on the most recent estimate of total construction costs and revenues. These scenarios included assumptions of various court decisions and the impact those decisions may have on the timing and extent of investment, including scenarios assuming the full resolution of permitting issues in addition to a scenario where the project does not proceed. Certain scenarios within the analysis included growth expectations from additional compression or other expansion opportunities and reopeners for pricing. An after-tax discount rate of 5.9% was used in the analysis. The discount rate was derived using a market participant approach with an adjusted risk premium for the underlying investment. Higher probabilities were generally assigned to those scenarios where court approvals were received and the project moves forward reflecting interim rates at prices subject to the reopeners. A low probability was assigned to the scenario where the project does not proceed.\nJudgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimates of future cash flows, discount rates, growth assumptions, and the likelihood of various scenarios. It is reasonably possible that future unfavorable developments, such as a reduced likelihood of success with court approvals, increased estimates of construction costs, material increases in the discount rate, important feedback on customer price increases or further significant delays, could result in a future impairment.\nFor further information on ACP, see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\".\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nThe calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are:\n \u2022 the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; \n \u2022 the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payments; and \n \u2022 the heath care cost trend rate. \nDuke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amounts that are in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period. Prior service cost or credit, which represents an increase or decrease in a plan's pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period.\n MD&A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \nAs of December 31, 2019, Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.85%. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability. Real assets, return-seeking fixed income, hedge funds and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments.\nDuke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 3.3% as of December 31, 2019. Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2019, Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy's pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy's 2019 pretax pension expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25% change in rates were to occur.

As of December 31, 2019, the health care cost trend rate was 6.0%, trending down to 4.75% by 2026. These plans are closed to new employees.\nFor further information, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans.\u201d\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy's capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders.\nAmong other provisions, the Tax Act lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminated bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, the reduction in federal income taxes will result in lower regulated customer rates. However, due to its existing NOL position and other tax credits, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash tax payer through at least 2027. As a result, any reduction in customer rates could cause a material reduction in consolidated cash flows from operations in the short term. Over time, the reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Act will increase Duke Energy's regulated rate base investments and customer rates. Impacts of Tax Act to Duke Energy's cash flows and credit metrics are subject to the regulatory actions of its state commissions, of which a substantial amount remain uncertain through ongoing rate case activity, and the FERC. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters,\u201d for additional information.\nThe Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities,\u201d for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement.\nDuke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy's current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses.\n MD&A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nEquity Issuance\nIn order to strengthen its balance sheet and credit metrics and bolster cash flows, in November 2019, Duke Energy entered into forward sales agreements for $2.5 billion of common stock equity expected to be settled in late 2020. Duke Energy plans to issue $500 million of common stock equity per year through at least 2022 through the DRIP and ATM programs. Additionally, Duke Energy will utilize other instruments as needed. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Stockholders' Equity,\" for further information regarding Duke Energy's equity issuances in 2019.\nCredit Facilities and Registration Statements\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nDuke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors. Duke Energy's projected capital and investment expenditures, including AFUDC debt and capitalized interest, for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.

There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDuke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 65% and 75%, based upon adjusted diluted EPS, and expects this trend to continue through 2024. In 2019 and 2018, Duke Energy increased the dividend by approximately 2% and 4%, respectively, and the company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend.\nDividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters,\u201d Duke Energy's wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2019, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend does not exceed a material amount of Duke Energy's net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy's ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nCash flows from operations of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy's operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.\n MD&A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nDuke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d for additional information).\nAt December 31, 2019, Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $311 million.\nDEBT ISSUANCES\nDepending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.\nIn 2020, Duke Energy anticipates issuing additional debt of $5.2 billion, primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities. See to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding significant debt issuances in 2019.\nDuke Energy's capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. Table 331: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Projected 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nDuke Energy's debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of December 31, 2019, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.\n MD&A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nCredit Ratings\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc. and S&P provide credit ratings for various Duke Energy Registrants. In January 2020, Fitch Ratings, Inc. publicly announced plans to withdraw the ratings on Duke Energy Corporation on or about February 20, 2020. The following table includes Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries' credit ratings and ratings outlook as of February 2020.

The Duke Energy Registrants' credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies' assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes Duke Energy's cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.

Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $1,454 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock; and \n \u2022 a $1,551 million decrease in net borrowings from notes payable and commercial paper primarily due to the use of proceeds from the preferred stock issuance and increased long-term debt issuances used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include performance guarantees, standby letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.\nMost of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Capital through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007, spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp, having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.\nDuke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications,\u201d for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy's operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIn November 2019, Duke Energy executed equity forward sales agreements. Settlement of the forward sales agreements are expected to occur on or prior to December 31, 2020. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Stockholders' Equity\u201d for further details on the equity forward sales agreements.\nOther than the guarantee arrangements discussed above, the equity forward sales agreements and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities\".\nTable 351: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MD&A\n</td> <td>OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nDuke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices.

Additionally, the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including nuclear insurance (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d), funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Employee Benefit Plans\"), AROs, including ash management expenditures (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations\") and regulatory liabilities (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters\u201d) because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are Deferred Income Taxes and ITCs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. \nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRisk Management Policies\nThe Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy includes strategy, operational, project execution and financial or transaction related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.\n MD&A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\nCommodity Price Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets. Duke Energy's exposure to these fluctuations is primarily limited by the cost-based regulation of its regulated operations as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations. Within Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment, the company has limited exposure to market price fluctuations in prices of energy-related products as a result of its ownership of renewable assets.\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy's exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging.\u201d\nHedging Strategies\nDuke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy's primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers. Additionally, Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables business may enter into short-term or long-term hedge agreements to manage price risk associated with project output.\nThe majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy's commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.\nDuke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract's fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.\nGeneration Portfolio Risks\nThe Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their generation portfolios, which include generation assets, fuel and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units.\nFor the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Debt and Credit Facilities,\u201d Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d and Fair Value Measurements.\u201d\nDuke Energy had $8.6 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2019. The impact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $86 million at December 31, 2019. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2019.\n MD&A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nCertain Duke Energy Registrants have variable-rate debt and manage interest rate risk by entering into financial contracts including interest rate swaps. See Notes 7 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and \"Derivatives and Hedging.\" Such financial arrangements generally are indexed based upon LIBOR, which is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has been identified by regulators and industry participants as the preferred successor rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR at that time. Impacted financial arrangements extending beyond 2021 may require contractual amendment or termination and renegotiation to fully adapt to a post-LIBOR environment, and there may be uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative index methodologies. Alternative index provisions are being assessed and incorporated into new financial arrangements that extend beyond 2021. Additionally, the progress of the phaseout is being monitored, including proposed transition relief from the FASB.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits.\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non-performance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Variable Interest Entities.\u201d Duke Energy also provides certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer credit worthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions.\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications,\u201d for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\n MD&A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.\nMarketable Securities Price Risk\nAs described further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nPension Plan Assets\nDuke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets.\nA significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy's results of operations in those periods.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\nAs required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2019, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes.\nAccounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations,\u201d for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d for additional information regarding NDTF assets.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCoal Combustion Residuals\nIn April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. Various industry and environmental parties appealed EPA's CCR rule in the D.C. Circuit Court. On April 18, 2016, EPA filed a motion with the federal court to settle five issues raised in litigation. On June 14, 2016, the court approved the motion with respect to all of those issues. Duke Energy does not expect a material impact from the settlement or that it will result in additional ARO adjustments. On September 13, 2017, EPA responded to a petition by the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group that the agency would reconsider certain provisions of the final rule, and asked the D.C. Circuit Court to suspend the litigation. The D.C. Circuit Court denied EPA's petition to suspend the litigation and oral argument was held on November 20, 2017. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision in the CCR rule litigation denying relief for industry petitioners' remaining claims and ruling in favor of environmental petitioners on a number of their challenges, including the regulation of inactive CCR surface impoundments at retired plants and the continued operation of unlined impoundments.\n MD&A OTHER MATTERS \nOn March 15, 2018, EPA published proposed amendments to the federal CCR rule, including revisions that were required as part of the CCR litigation settlement, as well as changes that the agency considered warranted due to the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provides statutory authority for state and federal CCR permit programs. On July 17, 2018, EPA issued a rule (Phase 1, Part 1) finalizing certain, but not all, elements included in the agency's March 15, 2018, proposal. The final rule revises certain closure deadlines and groundwater protection standards in the CCR rule. It does not change the primary requirements for groundwater monitoring, corrective action, inspections and maintenance, and closure, and thus does not materially affect Duke Energy's coal ash basin closure plans or compliance obligations under the CCR rule. On October 22, 2018, a coalition of environmental groups filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging EPA's final Phase 1, Part 1 revisions to the CCR rule. On March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an order in the Phase 1, Part 1 litigation granting EPA's motion to remand the rule without vacatur. EPA is currently conducting multiple notice-and-comment rulemakings to implement the court's decision on remand.\nIn addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by most states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy's regulated operations. For more information, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\nCoal Ash Management Act of 2014\nAROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions.\nConsistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy previously submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective plans to NCDEQ. In addition, on December 31, 2019, Duke Energy submitted updated groundwater corrective action plans and site-specific coal ash impoundment closure plans to NCDEQ.\nOn April 1, 2019, NCDEQ issued a closure determination requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to excavate all remaining coal ash impoundments at the Allen, Belews Creek, Rogers, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro facilities in North Carolina. On April 26, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed Petitions for Contested Case Hearings in the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge NCDEQ's April 1 Order. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins at these sites with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Belews Creek, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the two remaining basins at Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will not be disturbed and will be closed pursuant to other state regulations. For more information, see Note 5, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFollowing NCDEQ's April 1 Order, Duke Energy estimated the incremental undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining impoundments by excavation would be approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, potentially increasing the total estimated costs to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina to $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. The settlement lowers the estimated total undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining basins by excavation by approximately $1.5 billion as compared to Duke Energy's original estimate that followed the order. As a result, the estimated total cost to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina is now approximately $8 billion to $9 billion, of which approximately $2.3 billion has been spent through 2019. The majority of the remaining spend is expected to occur over the next 15-20 years. Duke Energy intends to seek recovery of all costs through the ratemaking process consistent with previous proceedings.\nIn 2019, Duke Energy completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend and Dan River plants and coal ash regulated by the Coal Ash Act at the Sutton plant.\nFor further information on ash basins and recovery, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Asset Retirement Obligations,\u201d respectively.\n MD&A OTHER MATTERS \nEstimated Cost and Impacts of Rulemakings\nDuke Energy will incur capital expenditures to comply with the environmental regulations and rules discussed above. The following table, as of December 31, 2019, provides five-year estimated costs, excluding AFUDC, of new control equipment that may need to be installed on existing power plants primarily to comply with the Coal Ash Act requirements for conversion to dry disposal of bottom ash and fly ash, CWA 316(b) and Effluent Limitations Guidelines through December 31, 2024. The table excludes ash basin closure costs recorded in Asset retirement obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information related to AROs, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table 369: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Five-Year Estimated Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Carolinas\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Progress Energy\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Progress\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Florida\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Ohio\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duke Energy Indiana\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance and other expenses, in addition to costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements, as a result of these regulations. Actual compliance costs incurred may be materially different from these estimates due to reasons such as the timing and requirements of EPA regulations and the resolution of legal challenges to the rules. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek rate recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with regulated operations to comply with these regulations.\nOther Environmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters, including the following:\n \u2022 Clean Water Act \n \u2022 Steam Effluent Limitation Guidelines \n \u2022 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule \n \u2022 Clean Power Plan/ACE Rule  Duke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nSection 126 Petitions\nOn November 16, 2016, the state of Maryland filed a petition with EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act alleging that 19 power plants, including two plants (three units) that Duke Energy Registrants own and operate, contribute to violations of EPA's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone in the state of Maryland. On March 12, 2018, the state of New York filed a petition with EPA, also under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act alleging that over 60 power plants, including six that Duke Energy Registrants own and operate, contribute to violations of EPA's ozone NAAQS in the state of New York. Both Maryland and New York sought EPA orders requiring the states in which the named power plants operate impose more stringent NOx emission limitations on the plants. On October 5, 2018, EPA denied the Maryland petition. That same day, Maryland appealed EPA's denial, On October 18, 2019, EPA denied the New York petition, and New York appealed that decision on October 29, 2019. Both appeals are before the D.C. Circuit Court. The impact of these petitions could be more stringent requirements for the operation of NOx emission controls at these plants. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nGlobal Climate Change\nOn September 17, 2019, Duke Energy announced an updated climate strategy with a new goal of net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. Timelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, will vary in each state in which the company operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' GHG emissions consist primarily of CO2 and result primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. In 2019, the Duke Energy Registrants' power plants emitted approximately 93 million tons of CO2. Future levels of CO2 emissions will be influenced by variables that include fuel prices, market prices, compliance with new or existing regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand and the technologies deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet the customer demand.\n MD&A OTHER MATTERS \nThe Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO2 emissions over time. Actions have included the retirement of 47 coal-fired Electric Generating Units with a combined generating capacity of 5,425 MW. Much of that capacity has been replaced with state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated. Duke Energy also has made investments to expand its portfolio of wind and solar projects, increase EE offerings and invest in its zero-CO2 emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO2 emissions. Between 2005 and 2019, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO2 emissions from their electricity generation by 39%, which potentially lowers the exposure to any future mandatory CO2 emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement. Duke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce CO2 emissions, including EE, wind, solar, storage and nuclear. Duke Energy will adjust to evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability that customers expect. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO2 limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants' operations impossible.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IRPs. These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the company's thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, EE and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.\nFor a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price on CO2 emissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential regulation of CO2 emissions. Incorporating a price on CO2 emissions in the IRPs allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One of the challenges with using a CO2 price, especially in the absence of a clear and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants typically use a range of potential CO2 prices to reflect a range of potential policy outcomes.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems by modernizing the electric grid through smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding and applying lessons learned from previous storms to restoration efforts. The Duke Energy Registrants' electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on-site to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity.\nState Legislation\nIn July 2017, the North Carolina General Assembly passed House Bill 589, and it was subsequently signed into law by the governor. The law includes, among other things, overall reform of the application of PURPA for new solar projects in the state, a requirement for the utility to procure approximately 2,600 MW of renewable energy through a competitive bidding process and recovery of costs related to the competitive bidding process through the fuel clause and a competitive procurement rider.\nIn accordance with the provisions of HB 589, total procurement was changed based upon how much generation with no economic dispatch or curtailment occurs over the procurement period. Most of this type of generation is solar procured under PURPA. Based upon the current forecasted amount of such generation that will occur over procurement period, Duke Energy estimates the total under HB 589 competitive procurement will be approximately 1,500 to 2,000 MW.\nBased on an independent evaluation process, Duke Energy will own or purchase a total of 551 MW of renewable energy from projects under the North Carolina's CPRE program. The process used was approved by the NCUC to select projects that would deliver the lowest cost renewable energy for customers. Five Duke Energy projects, totaling about 190 MW, were selected during the competitive bidding process. Duke Energy has completed the contracting process for the winning projects. A second tranche for CPRE opened in October 2019 and bids are due by March 9, 2020; the current target date for execution of the contracts is the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn various states, legislation is being considered to allow third-party sales of electricity. Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these initiatives.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP in the U.S., as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS discussed below. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries. Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, Progress Energy, Inc., Duke Energy Progress, LLC, Duke Energy Florida, LLC, Duke Energy Ohio, Inc., Duke Energy Indiana, LLC and Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc.. However, none of the registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the subsidiary registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nSee \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019, for a discussion of variance drivers for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017.\nDUKE ENERGY\nDuke Energy is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy's consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nExecutive Overview\nAt Duke Energy the fundamentals of our business are strong and allow us to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low-risk, predictable and transparent way. In 2019, we met our near-term financial commitments and positioned the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are focused on a business portfolio that will deliver a reliable dividend with 4% to 6% EPS growth through 2024. This growth is supported by our capital plan, timely cost-recovery mechanisms in most jurisdictions and our ability to manage our cost structure. The strength of our balance sheet is of vital importance to the cost-effective financing of our growth strategy, and in 2019 we continued to strengthen it by issuing $2 billion of preferred equity and $2.5 billion of common stock through a forward sales agreement which is expected to settle on or prior to December 31, 2020.\nFinancial Results\n (a) See Results of Operations below for Duke Energy's definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income available to Duke Energy and net income available to Duke Energy per diluted share. \n MD&A DUKE ENERGY \nDuke Energy's 2019 Net Income Available to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) were impacted by: favorable rate case and rider recovery outcomes, net of regulatory lag, and ongoing cost management efforts in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure; improved margins and increased ACP investment in Gas Utilities and Infrastructure; and growth in project investments in Commercial Renewables. See Results of Operations\u201d below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy's reportable business segments, as well as Other where financing costs increased in 2019 to fund segment operations and other liquidity needs.\n2019 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments\nOperational Excellence, Safety and Reliability. The reliable and safe operation of our power plants, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities is foundational to our customers, our financial results and our credibility with stakeholders. Our regulated generation fleet performance was strong throughout the year. All of our nuclear sites have achieved the industry's highest distinction rating. Our electric distribution system performed well throughout the year, with outage durations down when adjusted for storms. The safety of our workforce is a core value. Our employees delivered strong safety results in 2019, and we are at or near the top of our industry.\nStorm Response and System Restoration. The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season was the fourth consecutive year of above-average damaging storms. Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2019 storm response efforts is a testament to our team's extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and to on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts. Notably in 2019 Duke Energy earned EEI's Emergency Recovery Award, our 22nd EEI award since 1998 and a strong affirmation of the work of our employees to support customers when they need us most.\nCustomer Satisfaction. Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are the most important to the customer experience. In 2019, we instituted billing and payment-related communications and options, and we continue to enhance outage-related communications to customers.\nConstructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes. One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in our jurisdictions. Modernized constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. In 2019, Duke Energy, North Carolina regulators and environmentalists reached an agreement to permanently close all remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina. This agreement reduces the cost to close our coal ash basins for our Carolinas customers in comparison to the initial NCDEQ closure order. In 2019 we achieved constructive rate case outcomes driving earnings growth through rate base increases in South Carolina (electric), North Carolina (natural gas), Ohio (electric distribution) and Kentucky (natural gas). In addition, we have a multiyear rate plan in Florida and grid investment riders in the Midwest which enable more timely cost recovery and earnings growth.\nDigital Transformation. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity into the business. We continue to leverage new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape. In 2019, we created a team dedicated to developing applications and other solutions to deliver productivity gains and improvements to the customer experience.\nModernizing the Power Grid. Our grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for customers. In 2019, 79% of our jurisdictions were equipped with smart meters and we remain on track to be fully deployed across all regions by 2021. We continue to expand our self-optimizing grid capabilities, and in 2019 that saved over a half million customer interruptions.\nGenerating Cleaner Energy. Overall, we have lowered our carbon emissions by 39% since 2005, consistent with our new goal to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our commitment for 2030 includes retiring plants, operating our existing carbon-free resources and investing in natural gas infrastructure, renewables and our energy delivery system. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. That includes longer-term energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels.\nExpanding the Natural Gas Platform. We continue to pursue natural gas infrastructure investments. While the judicial and administrative challenges to date have been substantial, we are committed to the construction of the ACP pipeline to bring low-cost gas supply and economic development opportunities to the Southeast U.S. Construction is underway on a liquefied natural gas facility in Robeson County, North Carolina, on property Piedmont owns. This investment will help Piedmont provide a reliable gas supply to customers during peak usage periods and protect customers from price volatility when there is a higher-than-normal demand for natural gas.\nDividend Growth. In 2019, Duke Energy continued to grow the dividend payment to shareholders. 2019 represented the 93rd consecutive year Duke Energy paid a cash dividend on its common stock.\n MD&A DUKE ENERGY \nDuke Energy Objectives - 2020 and Beyond\nDuke Energy will continue to deliver exceptional value to customers, be an integral part of the communities in which we do business and provide attractive returns to investors. We have an achievable, long-term strategy in place, and it is producing tangible results, yet the industry in which we operate is becoming more and more dynamic. We are adjusting, where necessary, and accelerating our focus in key areas to ensure the company is well positioned to be successful for many decades into the future. As we look ahead to 2020, our plans include:\n \u2022 Continuing to place the customer at the center of all that we do which includes providing customized products and solutions \n \u2022 Strengthening our relationships with all our vast stakeholders in the communities in which we operate and invest \n \u2022 Generating cleaner energy and working to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 \n \u2022 Maintaining the safety of our communities and employees \n \u2022 Modernizing and strengthening the energy grid \n \u2022 Expanding the natural gas infrastructure \n \u2022 Deploying digital tools across our business  Results of Operations\nNon-GAAP Measures\nManagement evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. These items represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per-share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per-share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy's performance across periods.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings and Diluted EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively.\nSpecial items included in the periods presented include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:\n \u2022 Impairment Charges in 2019 represents a reduction of a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC and an OTTI on the remaining investment in Constitution. For 2018, it represents an impairment at Citrus County CC, a goodwill impairment at Commercial Renewables and an OTTI of an investment in Constitution. \n \u2022 Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from strategic acquisitions. \n \u2022 Regulatory and Legislative Impacts in 2018 represents charges related to the Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas North Carolina rate case orders and the repeal of the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. \n \u2022 Sale of Retired Plant represents the loss associated with selling Beckjord, a nonregulated generating facility in Ohio. \n \u2022 Impacts of the Tax Act represents amounts recognized related to the Tax Act. \n \u2022 Severance Charges relate to companywide initiatives, excluding merger integration, to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and workforce optimization.  Duke Energy's adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.\n MD&A DUKE ENERGY \nReconciliation of GAAP Reported Amounts to Adjusted Amounts\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. \n (a) Net of tax expense of $3 million in 2019. Net of tax benefit of $27 million and Noncontrolling Interests of $2 million in 2018. \n (b) Net of tax benefit of $19 million. \n (c) Net of tax benefit of $63 million. \n (d) Net of $25 million tax benefit. \n (e) The Tax Act reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As the tax change was enacted in 2017, Duke Energy was required to remeasure its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower rate at December 31, 2017. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, where the reduction in the net accumulated deferred income tax liability is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. This amount represents a true up of existing regulatory liabilities related to the Tax Act. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Income Taxes\" for more information. \n (f) Net of tax benefit of $43 million.  Year Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nGAAP Reported EPS was $5.06 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $3.76 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in GAAP Reported earnings was primarily due to current year favorable rate case and rider recovery outcomes, an adjustment related to income tax recognition for equity method investments, growth in Commercial Renewables from new solar farms commencing commercial operations and prior year regulatory and legislative impacts, impairments, severance, loss on sale of a retired plant and costs to achieve merger. This favorability was partially offset by higher depreciation and higher financing costs in the current year. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years.\nAs discussed and shown in the table above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted diluted EPS. Duke Energy's adjusted diluted EPS was $5.06 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4.72 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy's operations is presented as Other. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments,\u201d for additional information on Duke Energy's segment structure.\n\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure's results were impacted by positive contributions from the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases and Duke Energy Florida's base rate adjustments due to the Citrus County CC being placed in service. These drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation from a growing asset base and higher interest expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $603 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases and Duke Energy Florida's base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $45 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volumes.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $428 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to additional plant in service and new depreciation rates associated with the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases and Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC being placed in service; and \n \u2022 a $41 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to higher property taxes for additional plant in service at Duke Energy Florida and current year property tax reassessments at Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Ohio.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $317 million decrease in impairment charges primarily due to the impacts associated with the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases as well as impairment impacts related to Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC; and \n \u2022 a $134 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to lower payroll and benefit costs resulting from prior year workforce reductions and lower storm costs at Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas in the current year.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC equity return ending on the Citrus County CC in the fourth quarter of 2018 at Duke Energy Florida.\n\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven primarily by higher debt outstanding in the current year and AFUDC debt return ending in the fourth quarter of 2018 on the Citrus County CC at Duke Energy Florida.\nIncome Tax Expense. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes, mostly offset by an increase in pretax income. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, were 18.2% and 20.7%, respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes.\nMatters Impacting Future Electric Utilities and Infrastructure Results\nOn December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina with ash moved to on-site lined landfills. At the two remaining basins, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nOn May 21, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress received orders from the PSCSC granting the companies' requests for retail rate increases but denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed notices of appeals with the South Carolina Supreme Court on November 15, 2019. Appellant briefs are due on March 2, 2020, and Appellee response briefs are due on May 15, 2020. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if coal ash costs are not ultimately approved for recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn June 22, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas received an order from the NCUC, which denied the Grid Rider Stipulation and deferral treatment of grid improvement costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in their 2019 rate cases. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nDuring the last half of 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida's service territories were impacted by several named storms. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages to the service territories of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Duke Energy Florida's service territory was also impacted by Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 hurricane and the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian impacted Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida's service territories. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the deferral and future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nIn 2019, Duke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC, and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed general rate cases with the NCUC. The outcome of these rate cases could materially impact Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn April 17, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. Duke Energy Indiana has interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. Duke Energy Indiana's interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to potential legal challenges and further regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Indiana's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure's results were primarily impacted by higher equity earnings at ACP, the OTTI recorded on the Constitution investment and a 2019 adjustment related to the income tax recognition for equity method investments. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $70 million decrease due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers; and \n \u2022 a $13 million decrease due to rider revenues related to MGP and Accelerated Main Replacement Program.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $37 million increase due to North Carolina and Kentucky base rate case increases; \n \u2022 a $19 million increase due to North Carolina and Tennessee IMR increases; and \n \u2022 an $11 million increase due to NCUC approval related to tax reform accounting from fixed rate contracts.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $70 million decrease in the cost of natural gas due to lower natural gas prices.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $25 million increase in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to increased labor, benefits and information technology costs; and \n \u2022 an $11 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings at ACP as a result of higher cumulative project spending and a higher OTTI recorded on the Constitution investment in the prior year.\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven by higher debt outstanding in the current year and higher interest expense due to customers as a result of tax reform deferrals, partially offset by favorable AFUDC debt interest.\nIncome Tax Expense. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to an adjustment related to the income tax recognition for equity method\ninvestments, partially offset by an increase in pretax income. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, were 4.8% and 22.2%, respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to an adjustment related to the income tax recognition for equity method investments that was recorded during the first quarter of 2019 and current year AFUDC equity. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years.\n\nMatters Impacting Future Gas Utilities and Infrastructure Results\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 47% ownership interest in ACP, which is building an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets. Affected states (West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina) have issued certain necessary permits; the project remains subject to other pending federal and state approvals, which will allow full construction activities to begin. In 2018, FERC issued a series of Notices to Proceed, which authorized the project to begin certain construction-related activities along the pipeline route. Given legal challenges and ongoing discussions with customers, ACP expects mechanical completion of the full project in late 2021 with in-service likely in the first half of 2022. The delays resulting from legal challenges have also impacted the cost for the project. Project cost is approximately $8 billion, excluding financing costs. This estimate is based on the current facts available around construction costs and timelines, and is subject to future changes as those facts develop. Abnormal weather, work delays (including delays due to judicial or regulatory action) and other conditions may result in cost or schedule modifications, a suspension of AFUDC for ACP and/or impairment charges potentially material to Duke Energy's cash flows, financial position and results of operations. ACP and Duke Energy will continue to consider their options with respect to the foregoing given their existing contractual and legal obligations. See Notes 4 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for additional information.\nOn November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an order authorizing recovery of MGP costs at certain sites in Ohio with a deadline to complete the MGP environmental investigation and remediation work prior to December 31, 2016. This deadline was subsequently extended to December 31, 2019. Duke Energy Ohio has filed a request for extension of the deadline. A hearing on that request has not been scheduled. Disallowance of costs incurred, failure to complete the work by the deadline or failure to obtain an extension from the PUCO could result in an adverse impact on Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters,\u201d for additional information.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nCommercial Renewables \n (a) Certain projects are included in tax-equity structures where investors have differing interests in the project's economic attributes. In the table above, 100% of the tax-equity project's capacity is included.  Year Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nCommercial Renewables' results were favorable primarily due to new tax equity solar projects in the current year and a prior year goodwill impairment charge. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues. The increase was primarily due to new solar projects placed in service and higher irradiance.\nOperating Expenses. The decrease was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge in the prior year, partially offset by increased depreciation due to new solar projects placed in service.\nOther Income and Expenses, net. The decrease was primarily due to income from the FES settlement agreement in the prior year.\nIncome Tax Benefit. The decrease in the tax benefit was primarily driven by taxes associated with Duke Energy's interest in tax equity solar projects recorded during 2019 and a reduction in PTCs generated.\n\nLoss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The variance was primarily due to an increase in solar projects with tax equity investors. HLBV accounting was utilized, resulting in allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interest partners. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for more information.\nMatters Impacting Future Commercial Renewables Results\nCommercial Renewables continues to experience growth with tax equity projects; however, the future expiration of federal tax incentives could result in adverse impacts to future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDuring 2019, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of its renewable merchant plants principally in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas West market, due to declining market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices, primarily driven by lower forecasted natural gas prices. These assets were not impaired; however, a continued decline in energy market pricing would likely result in a future impairment. Impairment of these assets could result in adverse impacts to the future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Commercial Renewables. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" for additional information.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nOther \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nThe variance was driven by the prior year severance charges related to a corporate initiative, prior year loss on sale of the retired Beckjord station, and the absence in the current year of costs related to the Piedmont acquisition, offset by obligations to the Duke Energy Foundation in 2019. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Expenses. The variance was primarily due to prior year severance charges related to a corporate initiative as well as costs associated with the Piedmont acquisition, partially offset by obligations to the Duke Energy Foundation in 2019.\nLosses on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The variance was driven by the prior year loss on sale of the retired Beckjord station, including the transfer of coal ash basins and other real property and indemnification from all potential future claims related to the property, whether arising under environmental laws or otherwise.\nOther Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily due to higher returns on investments that fund certain employee benefit obligations and Bison investment income.\nInterest Expense. The variance was primarily due to higher outstanding debt in the current year and higher short-term interest rates.\nIncome Tax Benefit. The decrease in the tax benefit was primarily driven by a decrease in pretax losses.\nPreferred Dividends. The variance was driven by the declarations of preferred stock dividend on preferred stock issued in 2019.\nMatters Impacting Future Other Results\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\n MD&A DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS \nSUBSIDIARY REGISTRANTS\nBasis of Presentation\nThe results of operations and variance discussion for the Subsidiary Registrants is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K.\nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS\nResults of Operations \nThe following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Carolinas. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities, public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $178 million increase in retail pricing due to the impacts of the prior year North Carolina rate case and the current year South Carolina rate case.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $41 million decrease in rider revenues primarily due to excess deferred taxes, partially offset by EE programs and a decrement rider relating to nuclear decommissioning that ended in the prior year; \n \u2022 a $14 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volumes; and \n \u2022 a $7 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to unfavorable weather in the current year.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $262 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to decreased labor and storm restoration costs; and \n \u2022 a $175 million decrease in impairment charges primarily due to impacts of the prior year North Carolina rate order, the repeal of the South Carolina Base Load Review Act and charges related to coal ash costs in South Carolina. \n MD&A DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS \nPartially offset by:\n \u2022 a $187 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to additional plant in service, new depreciation rates associated with the prior year North Carolina rate case and the current year South Carolina rate case and higher amortization of deferred coal ash costs associated with the prior year North Carolina rate case.  Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to higher debt outstanding in the current year.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nOn December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas agreed to excavate five of the six remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina with ash moved to on-site lined landfills. At the one remaining basin, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Carolinas' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nDuke Energy Carolinas filed a general rate case with the NCUC on September 30, 2019. The outcome of this rate case could materially impact Duke Energy Carolina's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn May 21, 2019, the PSCSC issued an order granting Duke Energy Carolinas request for a retail rate increase but denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a notice of appeal with the South Carolina Supreme Court on November 15, 2019. Appellant briefs are due on March 2, 2020, and Appellee response briefs are due on May 15, 2020. Duke Energy Carolinas' results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if coal ash costs are not ultimately approved for recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn June 22, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas received an order from the NCUC, which denied the Grid Rider Stipulation and deferral treatment of grid improvement costs. Duke Energy Carolinas has petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in its 2019 rate case. Duke Energy Carolinas' results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nDuring the last half of 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas' service territory was impacted by several named storms. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages in the service territory. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the deferral and future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Carolinas' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nPROGRESS ENERGY\nResults of Operations \n MD&A PROGRESS ENERGY \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $366 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to the impacts of the prior year North Carolina rate case and current year South Carolina rate case at Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida's base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service and annual increases from the 2017 Settlement Agreement; \n \u2022 a $70 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of fuel, primarily due to coal ash cost recovery in the current year at Duke Energy Progress and increased demand at Duke Energy Florida; \n \u2022 a $42 million increase in fuel revenues primarily related to increased fuel cost recovery due to extreme weather in the prior year at Duke Energy Progress, partially offset by a decrease in fuel and capacity rates billed to retail customers at Duke Energy Florida; \n \u2022 a $22 million increase in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to favorable weather in the current year at Duke Energy Florida; and \n \u2022 a $21 million increase in other revenues primarily due to increased transmission revenues and nonregulated products and services revenues at Duke Energy Florida.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $47 million decrease in retail rider revenues primarily related to decreased revenue requirements in the current year; and \n \u2022 a $14 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volumes at Duke Energy Florida.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $226 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to higher amortization of deferred coal ash costs, new depreciation rates associated with the prior year Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate case and Duke Energy Florida's base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service; \n \u2022 a $48 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to an increase in the North Carolina Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard requirement from the prior year at Duke Energy Progress, partially offset by lower purchased power and lower fuel costs, net of deferrals, at Duke Energy Florida; and \n \u2022 a $32 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to current year property tax reassessments and a favorable sales and use tax credit in the prior year at Duke Energy Progress and higher property taxes for additional plant in service at Duke Energy Florida.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $118 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to lower storm costs, reduced outage costs, and lower employee benefit costs, partially offset by increased vegetation management costs at Duke Energy Florida; and \n \u2022 a $111 million decrease in impairment charges primarily due to prior year impacts associated with the North Carolina rate case at Duke Energy Progress as well as the impairment of Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC equity return ending on the Citrus County CC in the fourth quarter of 2018 at Duke Energy Florida, partially offset by life insurance proceeds at Duke Energy Progress.\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC debt return ending in the fourth quarter of 2018 on the Citrus County CC at Duke Energy Florida.\nIncome Tax Expense. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes and a Tax Act adjustment in the prior year related to excess deferred taxes.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nOn December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate two of the three remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina with ash moved to on-site lined landfills. At the one remaining basin, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nDuke Energy Progress filed a general rate case with the NCUC on October 30, 2019. The outcome of this rate case could materially impact Progress Energy's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn May 21, 2019, the PSCSC issued an order granting Duke Energy Progress' request for a retail rate increase but denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Progress filed a notice of appeal with the South Carolina Supreme Court on November 15, 2019. Appellant briefs are due on March 2, 2020, and Appellee response briefs are due on May 15, 2020. Progress Energy's results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if coal ash costs are not ultimately approved for recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\n MD&A PROGRESS ENERGY \nDuke Energy Progress has petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in its 2019 rate case. Progress Energy's results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nDuring the last half of 2018, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida's service territories were impacted by several named storms. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages to the service territory of Duke Energy Progress. Duke Energy Florida's service territory was also impacted by Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 hurricane and the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian impacted Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's service territories. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred.

The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities, public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $110 million increase in retail pricing due to the impacts of the prior year North Carolina rate case and the current year South Carolina rate case; \n \u2022 a $101 million increase in fuel revenues primarily related to increased fuel cost recovery due to extreme weather in the prior year; and \n \u2022 a $54 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of fuel, primarily due to coal ash cost recovery in the current year.  Partially Offset by:\n \u2022 a $21 million decrease primarily due to the return of excess deferred incomes taxes created by the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, partially offset by an increase in rider revenues related to EE programs. \n MD&A DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS \nOperating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $152 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to higher amortization of deferred coal ash costs and new depreciation rates associated with the prior year North Carolina and current year South Carolina rate cases, partially offset by the amortization credit for the North Carolina Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard requirement increase from prior year; \n \u2022 a $120 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to a higher deferred fuel balance and an increase in the North Carolina Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard requirement from prior year, partially offset by lower demand and changes in generation mix; and \n \u2022 a $21 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to current year property tax reassessments and a favorable sales and use tax credit in the prior year.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $132 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to lower storm costs in current year, reduced outage costs and lower employee benefit costs; and \n \u2022 a $21 million decrease in impairment charges primarily due to prior year impacts associated with the North Carolina rate case.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was driven primarily by life insurance proceeds.\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven primarily by lower interest rates on outstanding debt.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nOn December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate two of the three remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina with ash moved to on-site lined landfills. At the one remaining basin, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nDuke Energy Progress filed a general rate case with the NCUC on October 30, 2019. The outcome of this rate case could materially impact Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nOn May 21, 2019, the PSCSC issued an order granting Duke Energy Progress' request for a retail rate increase but denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Progress filed a notice of appeal with the South Carolina Supreme Court on November 15, 2019. Appellant briefs are due on March 2, 2020, and Appellee response briefs are due on May 15, 2020. Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if coal ash costs are not ultimately approved for recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nDuke Energy Progress has petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in its 2019 rate case. Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nDuring the last half of 2018, Duke Energy Progress' service territory was impacted by several named storms. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages in the service territory. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian reached the Carolinas bringing high winds, tornadoes and heavy rain, impacting about 300,000 customers within the service territory. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the deferral and future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Progress' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Wholesale power sales include both billed and unbilled sales. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities, public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $256 million increase in retail pricing due to base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service, annual increases from the 2017 Settlement Agreement and the Solar Base Rate Adjustment; \n \u2022 a $22 million increase in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to favorable weather in the current year; \n \u2022 a $21 million increase in other revenues primarily due to increased transmission revenues and nonregulated products and services revenues; and \n \u2022 a $16 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of fuel, primarily due to increased demand.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $59 million decrease in fuel and capacity revenues primarily due to a decrease in fuel and capacity rates billed to retail customers; \n \u2022 a $33 million decrease in retail rider revenues primarily related to decreased revenue requirements in the current year; and \n \u2022 a $14 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volumes. \n MD&A DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA \nOperating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $90 million decrease in impairment charges primarily due to a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC and a reduction of the impairment in the current year; and \n \u2022 a $73 million decrease in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to lower purchased power and lower fuel costs, net of deferrals.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $74 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to base rate adjustments related to Citrus County CC being placed in service, other additional plant in service and increases resulting from the 2018 Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear decommissioning cost study; \n \u2022 an $18 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to higher property taxes from additional plant in service; and \n \u2022 a $9 million increase in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to increased vegetation management costs and deregulation initiative costs, partially offset by lower severance charges.  Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC equity return ending on the Citrus County CC in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nInterest Expense. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC debt return ending on the Citrus County CC in the fourth quarter of 2018 and higher debt outstanding in the current year.\nIncome Tax Expense. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income in the current year.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nOn October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall on Florida's Panhandle as a Category 5 hurricane, the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. The storm caused significant damage within the service territory of Duke Energy Florida, particularly from Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach. In September 2019, Duke Energy Florida's service territory was threatened by Hurricane Dorian with landfall as a possible Category 5 hurricane and therefore Duke Energy Florida incurred costs to secure necessary resources to be prepared for that potential impact. A significant portion of the incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to these storms has been deferred. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Florida's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities, public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $45 million decrease in fuel related revenues primarily due to a decrease in price; \n \u2022 a $31 million decrease in rider revenues primarily due to the cessation of the Smart Grid Rider in 2018 and the Tax Cut and Jobs Act Rider beginning in 2019, partially offset by new riders implemented in conjunction with rate cases including the Price Stabilization Rider, Electric Service Reliability Rider and the Environmental Surcharge Mechanism; \n \u2022 a $15 million decrease in FTR rider revenues; and \n \u2022 a $12 million decrease in electric and natural gas retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to unfavorable weather in the current year.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $71 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to rate case impacts; and \n \u2022 an $18 million increase in PJM point-to-point transmission revenues due to an increase in the Network Integration Transmission Service rate primarily due to additional plant in service. \n MD&A DUKE ENERGY OHIO \nOperating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $40 million increase in operations, maintenance and other expense primarily due to the FERC approved settlement refund of certain transmission costs previously billed by PJM recorded in 2018 and increased PJM transmission expansion fees; and \n \u2022 an $18 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to additional plant in service, partially offset by a negotiated reassessment of property values and property tax true ups for prior periods.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $24 million decrease in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power expense due to the prior year outage at East Bend Station and the deferral of OVEC related purchased power costs; and \n \u2022 an $18 million decrease in the cost of natural gas primarily due to lower costs passed through to customers, as a result of a lower natural gas prices.  Losses on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The increase was driven by the loss on the prior year sale of Beckjord.\nInterest Expense. The variance was primarily due to higher debt outstanding in the current year.\n MD&A DUKE ENERGY OHIO \nMatters Impacting Future Results\nOn November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an order authorizing recovery of MGP costs at certain sites in Ohio with a deadline to complete the MGP environmental investigation and remediation work prior to December 31, 2016. This deadline was subsequently extended to December 31, 2019. Duke Energy Ohio has filed a request for extension of the deadline. A hearing on that request has not been scheduled. Disallowance of costs incurred, failure to complete the work by the deadline or failure to obtain an extension from the PUCO could result in an adverse impact on Duke Energy Ohio's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters,\u201d for additional information.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA\nResults of Operations \nThe following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Indiana. The below percentages for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes billed and unbilled retail sales and wholesale sales to incorporated municipalities, public and private utilities and power marketers. Amounts are not weather-normalized. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $21 million decrease in wholesale power revenues primarily due to the expiration of a contract with a wholesale customer; \n \u2022 a $16 million decrease in other transmission FTR revenues due to lower congestion; and \n \u2022 a $14 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volume.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $65 million decrease in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power expense primarily due to lower coal and natural gas costs, partially offset by higher purchase power fuel clause, higher amortization of deferred fuel costs and higher deferred MISO charges; and \n \u2022 a $30 million decrease in impairments primarily due to the prior year Edwardsport IGCC settlement agreement. \n MD&A DUKE ENERGY INDIANA \nMatters Impacting Future Results\nOn April 17, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. Duke Energy Indiana has interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. Duke Energy Indiana's interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to potential legal challenges and further regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Indiana's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDuke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC on July 2, 2019, its first general rate case in Indiana in 16 years. The outcome of this rate case could materially impact Duke Energy Indiana's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nPIEDMONT\nResults of Operations \nThe following table shows the percent changes in Dth delivered and average number of customers. The percentages for all throughput deliveries represent billed and unbilled sales. Amounts are not weather-normalized. \nPiedmont's throughput was 511,243,774 Dth and 557,145,128 Dth for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Due to the margin decoupling mechanism in North Carolina, WNA mechanisms in South Carolina and Tennessee and fixed price contracts with most power generation customers, changes in throughput deliveries do not have a material impact on Piedmont's revenues or earnings. The margin decoupling mechanism adjusts for variations in residential and commercial use per customer, including those due to weather and conservation. The WNA mechanisms mostly offset the impact of weather on bills rendered, but do not ensure full recovery of approved margin during periods when winter weather is significantly warmer or colder than normal.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $24 million increase due to North Carolina base rate case increases; \n \u2022 a $19 million increase due to North Carolina and Tennessee IMR increases; and \n MD&A PIEDMONT \n \u2022 an $11 million increase due to NCUC approval related to tax reform accounting from fixed rate contracts.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $52 million decrease due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers.  Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $52 million decrease in cost of natural gas due to lower natural gas prices; and \n \u2022 a $29 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense due to lower information technology outside services and labor costs.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $13 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service. \nMatters Impacting Future Results\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion of risks associated with the Tax Act.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nPreparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations, cash flows or the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations.\nManagement discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.\nFor further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulated Operations Accounting\nSubstantially all of Duke Energy's regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred.\nManagement continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as:\n \u2022 applicable regulatory environment changes; \n \u2022 historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy's jurisdictions; \n \u2022 litigation of rate orders; \n \u2022 recent rate orders to other regulated entities; \n \u2022 levels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity; and \n \u2022 the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets.\nAs required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments\nDuke Energy performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all reporting units as of August 31, 2019. Additionally, Duke Energy monitors all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required. Such events and circumstances include an adverse regulatory outcome, declining financial performance and deterioration of industry or market conditions. As of August 31, 2019, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.\n MD&A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \nEstimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on Duke Energy's internal business plan. Significant assumptions used are growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rates. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the WACC for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2019 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2019, for each of Duke Energy's reporting units ranged from 5.2% to 5.9%. The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management's estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.\nOne of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer's primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31.\nDuke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy's regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity.\nFor further information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change.\nObligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2019, Duke Energy Florida, entered into an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station. Closing of this agreement is contingent upon approval of the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured using probability weightings of an obligation based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027 and an obligation based on the unit in SAFSTOR, with decommissioning beginning in 2067 and ending in 2074. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built DOE facility.\nObligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. During 2019, Duke Energy reached a settlement agreement with the NCDEQ and SELC to excavate 7 and partially excavate 2 of the remaining ash basins in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress service territories. In 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress remeasured their obligations to reflect the results of the settlement.\nFor further information, see Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated Operations\nDuke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value.\nPerforming an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.\nWhen determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.\nDuring 2019, Duke Energy sold a minority interest in a portion of certain Commercial Renewable assets. Following the sale, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of the assets included in the sale as the fair value of consideration received for the portfolio was less than the carrying value of the assets. It was determined the assets were all recoverable. Additionally, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of certain renewable merchant plants during 2019 due to declining market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices. It was determined the assets were all recoverable as the carrying value of the assets approximated the aggregate estimated future cash flows.\n MD&A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \nFor further information, see Notes 3 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Business Segments\" and \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\"\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value. If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.\nEvents or changes in circumstances are monitored that may indicate, in management's judgment, the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. The fair value of equity method investments is generally estimated using an income approach where significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows, the appropriate discount rate, and probability weighted-scenarios, if applicable. In certain instances, a market approach may also be used to estimate the fair value of the equity method investment.\nEvents or changes in circumstances that may be indicative of an other-than-temporary decline in value will vary by investment, but may include:\n \u2022 Significant delays in or failure to complete significant growth projects of investees; \n \u2022 Adverse regulatory actions expected to substantially reduce the investee's product demand or profitability; \n \u2022 Expected financial performance significantly worse than anticipated when initially invested; \n \u2022 Prolonged period the fair value is below carrying value; \n \u2022 A significant or sustained decline in the market value of an investee; \n \u2022 Lower than expected cash distributions from investees; \n \u2022 Significant asset impairments or operating losses recognized by investees; and \n \u2022 Loss of significant customers or suppliers with no immediate prospects for replacement.  ACP\nAs of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the equity method investment in ACP is $1.2 billion, and Duke Energy's maximum exposure to loss for its guarantee of the ACP revolving credit facility is $827 million. During 2018 and 2019, ACP received several adverse court rulings as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\" As a result, Duke Energy evaluated this investment for impairment and determined that fair value approximated carrying value and therefore no impairment was necessary.\nDuke Energy estimated the fair value of its investment in ACP using an income approach that primarily considered probability-weighted scenarios of discounted future net cash flows based on the most recent estimate of total construction costs and revenues. These scenarios included assumptions of various court decisions and the impact those decisions may have on the timing and extent of investment, including scenarios assuming the full resolution of permitting issues in addition to a scenario where the project does not proceed. Certain scenarios within the analysis included growth expectations from additional compression or other expansion opportunities and reopeners for pricing. An after-tax discount rate of 5.9% was used in the analysis. The discount rate was derived using a market participant approach with an adjusted risk premium for the underlying investment. Higher probabilities were generally assigned to those scenarios where court approvals were received and the project moves forward reflecting interim rates at prices subject to the reopeners. A low probability was assigned to the scenario where the project does not proceed.\nJudgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimates of future cash flows, discount rates, growth assumptions, and the likelihood of various scenarios. It is reasonably possible that future unfavorable developments, such as a reduced likelihood of success with court approvals, increased estimates of construction costs, material increases in the discount rate, important feedback on customer price increases or further significant delays, could result in a future impairment.\nFor further information on ACP, see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\".\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nThe calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are:\n \u2022 the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; \n \u2022 the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payments; and \n \u2022 the heath care cost trend rate. \nDuke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amounts that are in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period. Prior service cost or credit, which represents an increase or decrease in a plan's pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period.\n MD&A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \nAs of December 31, 2019, Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.85%. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability. Real assets, return-seeking fixed income, hedge funds and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments.\nDuke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 3.3% as of December 31, 2019. Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2019, Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy's pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy's 2019 pretax pension expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25% change in rates were to occur. \nDuke Energy's other post-retirement plan uses a health care cost trend rate covering both pre- and post-age 65 retired plan participants, which is comprised of a medical care cost trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in medical costs, and a prescription drug cost trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug costs. As of December 31, 2019, the health care cost trend rate was 6.0%, trending down to 4.75% by 2026. These plans are closed to new employees.\nFor further information, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans.\u201d\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy's capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders.\nAmong other provisions, the Tax Act lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminated bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, the reduction in federal income taxes will result in lower regulated customer rates. However, due to its existing NOL position and other tax credits, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash tax payer through at least 2027. As a result, any reduction in customer rates could cause a material reduction in consolidated cash flows from operations in the short term. Over time, the reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Act will increase Duke Energy's regulated rate base investments and customer rates. Impacts of Tax Act to Duke Energy's cash flows and credit metrics are subject to the regulatory actions of its state commissions, of which a substantial amount remain uncertain through ongoing rate case activity, and the FERC. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters,\u201d for additional information.\nThe Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities,\u201d for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement.\nDuke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy's current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses.\n MD&A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nEquity Issuance\nIn order to strengthen its balance sheet and credit metrics and bolster cash flows, in November 2019, Duke Energy entered into forward sales agreements for $2.5 billion of common stock equity expected to be settled in late 2020. Duke Energy plans to issue $500 million of common stock equity per year through at least 2022 through the DRIP and ATM programs. Additionally, Duke Energy will utilize other instruments as needed. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Stockholders' Equity,\" for further information regarding Duke Energy's equity issuances in 2019.\nCredit Facilities and Registration Statements\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nDuke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors. Duke Energy's projected capital and investment expenditures, including AFUDC debt and capitalized interest, for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below. \nDEBT MATURITIES\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding significant components of Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDIVIDEND PAYMENTS\nIn 2019, Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 93rd consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDuke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 65% and 75%, based upon adjusted diluted EPS, and expects this trend to continue through 2024. In 2019 and 2018, Duke Energy increased the dividend by approximately 2% and 4%, respectively, and the company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend.\nDividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters,\u201d Duke Energy's wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2019, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend does not exceed a material amount of Duke Energy's net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy's ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nCash flows from operations of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy's operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.\n MD&A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nDuke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d for additional information).\nAt December 31, 2019, Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $311 million.\nDEBT ISSUANCES\nDepending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.\nIn 2020, Duke Energy anticipates issuing additional debt of $5.2 billion, primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities. See to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding significant debt issuances in 2019.\nDuke Energy's capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. \nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nDuke Energy's debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of December 31, 2019, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.\n MD&A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nCredit Ratings\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc. and S&P provide credit ratings for various Duke Energy Registrants. In January 2020, Fitch Ratings, Inc. publicly announced plans to withdraw the ratings on Duke Energy Corporation on or about February 20, 2020. The following table includes Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries' credit ratings and ratings outlook as of February 2020. \nCredit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies' assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes Duke Energy's cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years. \n MD&A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nOPERATING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy's operating cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years. \nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $241 million increase in net income after adjustment for non-cash items primarily due to increases in revenues as a result of rate increases in the current year, partially offset by decreases in current year non-cash adjustments; \n \u2022 a $573 million refund of AMT credit carryforwards; \n \u2022 a $253 million decrease in cash outflows from working capital primarily due to fluctuations in accounts receivable balances, including a prior year increase for AMT refunds, and prior year increases in regulatory assets related to fuel costs, partially offset by fluctuations in inventory levels and current year decreases in property tax and severance accruals; and \n \u2022 a $105 million payment in the prior year for disposal of Beckjord.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $213 million increase in payments for AROs. \nINVESTING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy's investing cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years. \nThe primary use of cash related to investing activities is capital, investment and acquisition expenditures, net of return of investment capital detailed by reportable business segment in the following table. The increase includes expenditures related to line improvements in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment and pipeline construction and improvement in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, as well as increased investment in the Commercial Renewables segment. \n MD&A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nFINANCING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy's financing cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years. \nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $1,962 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock; \n \u2022 a $1,222 million net increase in proceeds from issuances of long-term debt primarily due to timing of issuances and redemptions of long-term debt; and \n \u2022 an $802 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests, including $415 million related to the sale of a noncontrolling interest in the Commercial Renewables segment.  Partially offset by:\n \u2022 a $1,454 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock; and \n \u2022 a $1,551 million decrease in net borrowings from notes payable and commercial paper primarily due to the use of proceeds from the preferred stock issuance and increased long-term debt issuances used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include performance guarantees, standby letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.\nMost of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Capital through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007, spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp, having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.\nDuke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications,\u201d for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy's operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIn November 2019, Duke Energy executed equity forward sales agreements. Settlement of the forward sales agreements are expected to occur on or prior to December 31, 2020. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Stockholders' Equity\u201d for further details on the equity forward sales agreements.\nOther than the guarantee arrangements discussed above, the equity forward sales agreements and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities\".\n\nContractual Obligations\nDuke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes Duke Energy's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2019. \n (a) See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities.\u201d \n (b) Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using December 31, 2019, interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments. \n (c) See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Leases.\u201d Amounts in the table above include the interest component of finance leases based on the interest rates stated in the lease agreements and exclude certain related executory costs. Amounts exclude contingent lease obligations. \n (d) Current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term debt, and purchase obligations reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been excluded from the above table. \n (e) Includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as NPNS. For contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at December 31, 2019, or the best projections of the index. For certain of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting arrangements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. \n (f) Amounts exclude obligations under the OVEC PPA. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" for additional information. \n (g) Includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for EPC costs for new generation plants, wind and solar facilities, plant refurbishments, maintenance and day-to-day contract work and commitments to buy certain products. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. \n (h) Related to future annual funding obligations to NDTF through nuclear power stations' relicensing dates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\" \n (i) Related to Commercial Renewables wind facilities. \n (j) Unrecognized tax benefits of $126 million are not reflected in this table as Duke Energy cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Income Taxes.\" \n (k) The table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance claims (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing and amount of cash payments that will be required. Additionally, the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including nuclear insurance (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d), funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Employee Benefit Plans\"), AROs, including ash management expenditures (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations\") and regulatory liabilities (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters\u201d) because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are Deferred Income Taxes and ITCs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. \nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRisk Management Policies\nThe Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy includes strategy, operational, project execution and financial or transaction related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.\n MD&A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\nCommodity Price Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets. Duke Energy's exposure to these fluctuations is primarily limited by the cost-based regulation of its regulated operations as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations. Within Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment, the company has limited exposure to market price fluctuations in prices of energy-related products as a result of its ownership of renewable assets.\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy's exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging.\u201d\nHedging Strategies\nDuke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy's primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers. Additionally, Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables business may enter into short-term or long-term hedge agreements to manage price risk associated with project output.\nThe majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy's commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.\nDuke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract's fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.\nGeneration Portfolio Risks\nThe Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their generation portfolios, which include generation assets, fuel and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units.\nFor the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Debt and Credit Facilities,\u201d Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d and Fair Value Measurements.\u201d\nDuke Energy had $8.6 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2019. The impact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $86 million at December 31, 2019. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2019.\n MD&A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nCertain Duke Energy Registrants have variable-rate debt and manage interest rate risk by entering into financial contracts including interest rate swaps. See Notes 7 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and \"Derivatives and Hedging.\" Such financial arrangements generally are indexed based upon LIBOR, which is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has been identified by regulators and industry participants as the preferred successor rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR at that time. Impacted financial arrangements extending beyond 2021 may require contractual amendment or termination and renegotiation to fully adapt to a post-LIBOR environment, and there may be uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative index methodologies. Alternative index provisions are being assessed and incorporated into new financial arrangements that extend beyond 2021. Additionally, the progress of the phaseout is being monitored, including proposed transition relief from the FASB.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits.\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non-performance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Variable Interest Entities.\u201d Duke Energy also provides certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer credit worthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions.\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications,\u201d for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\n MD&A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.\nMarketable Securities Price Risk\nAs described further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nPension Plan Assets\nDuke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets.\nA significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy's results of operations in those periods.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\nAs required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2019, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes.\nAccounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations,\u201d for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d for additional information regarding NDTF assets.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCoal Combustion Residuals\nIn April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. Various industry and environmental parties appealed EPA's CCR rule in the D.C. Circuit Court. On April 18, 2016, EPA filed a motion with the federal court to settle five issues raised in litigation. On June 14, 2016, the court approved the motion with respect to all of those issues. Duke Energy does not expect a material impact from the settlement or that it will result in additional ARO adjustments. On September 13, 2017, EPA responded to a petition by the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group that the agency would reconsider certain provisions of the final rule, and asked the D.C. Circuit Court to suspend the litigation. The D.C. Circuit Court denied EPA's petition to suspend the litigation and oral argument was held on November 20, 2017. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision in the CCR rule litigation denying relief for industry petitioners' remaining claims and ruling in favor of environmental petitioners on a number of their challenges, including the regulation of inactive CCR surface impoundments at retired plants and the continued operation of unlined impoundments.\n MD&A OTHER MATTERS \nOn March 15, 2018, EPA published proposed amendments to the federal CCR rule, including revisions that were required as part of the CCR litigation settlement, as well as changes that the agency considered warranted due to the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provides statutory authority for state and federal CCR permit programs. On July 17, 2018, EPA issued a rule (Phase 1, Part 1) finalizing certain, but not all, elements included in the agency's March 15, 2018, proposal. The final rule revises certain closure deadlines and groundwater protection standards in the CCR rule. It does not change the primary requirements for groundwater monitoring, corrective action, inspections and maintenance, and closure, and thus does not materially affect Duke Energy's coal ash basin closure plans or compliance obligations under the CCR rule. On October 22, 2018, a coalition of environmental groups filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging EPA's final Phase 1, Part 1 revisions to the CCR rule. On March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an order in the Phase 1, Part 1 litigation granting EPA's motion to remand the rule without vacatur. EPA is currently conducting multiple notice-and-comment rulemakings to implement the court's decision on remand.\nIn addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by most states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy's regulated operations. For more information, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\nCoal Ash Management Act of 2014\nAROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions.\nConsistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy previously submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective plans to NCDEQ. In addition, on December 31, 2019, Duke Energy submitted updated groundwater corrective action plans and site-specific coal ash impoundment closure plans to NCDEQ.\nOn April 1, 2019, NCDEQ issued a closure determination requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to excavate all remaining coal ash impoundments at the Allen, Belews Creek, Rogers, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro facilities in North Carolina. On April 26, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed Petitions for Contested Case Hearings in the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge NCDEQ's April 1 Order. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins at these sites with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Belews Creek, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the two remaining basins at Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will not be disturbed and will be closed pursuant to other state regulations. For more information, see Note 5, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFollowing NCDEQ's April 1 Order, Duke Energy estimated the incremental undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining impoundments by excavation would be approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, potentially increasing the total estimated costs to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina to $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. The settlement lowers the estimated total undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining basins by excavation by approximately $1.5 billion as compared to Duke Energy's original estimate that followed the order. As a result, the estimated total cost to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina is now approximately $8 billion to $9 billion, of which approximately $2.3 billion has been spent through 2019. The majority of the remaining spend is expected to occur over the next 15-20 years. Duke Energy intends to seek recovery of all costs through the ratemaking process consistent with previous proceedings.\nIn 2019, Duke Energy completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend and Dan River plants and coal ash regulated by the Coal Ash Act at the Sutton plant.\nFor further information on ash basins and recovery, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and Asset Retirement Obligations,\u201d respectively.\n MD&A OTHER MATTERS \nEstimated Cost and Impacts of Rulemakings\nDuke Energy will incur capital expenditures to comply with the environmental regulations and rules discussed above. The following table, as of December 31, 2019, provides five-year estimated costs, excluding AFUDC, of new control equipment that may need to be installed on existing power plants primarily to comply with the Coal Ash Act requirements for conversion to dry disposal of bottom ash and fly ash, CWA 316(b) and Effluent Limitations Guidelines through December 31, 2024. The table excludes ash basin closure costs recorded in Asset retirement obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information related to AROs, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance and other expenses, in addition to costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements, as a result of these regulations. Actual compliance costs incurred may be materially different from these estimates due to reasons such as the timing and requirements of EPA regulations and the resolution of legal challenges to the rules. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek rate recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with regulated operations to comply with these regulations.\nOther Environmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters, including the following:\n \u2022 Clean Water Act \n \u2022 Steam Effluent Limitation Guidelines \n \u2022 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule \n \u2022 Clean Power Plan/ACE Rule  Duke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nSection 126 Petitions\nOn November 16, 2016, the state of Maryland filed a petition with EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act alleging that 19 power plants, including two plants (three units) that Duke Energy Registrants own and operate, contribute to violations of EPA's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone in the state of Maryland. On March 12, 2018, the state of New York filed a petition with EPA, also under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act alleging that over 60 power plants, including six that Duke Energy Registrants own and operate, contribute to violations of EPA's ozone NAAQS in the state of New York. Both Maryland and New York sought EPA orders requiring the states in which the named power plants operate impose more stringent NOx emission limitations on the plants. On October 5, 2018, EPA denied the Maryland petition. That same day, Maryland appealed EPA's denial, On October 18, 2019, EPA denied the New York petition, and New York appealed that decision on October 29, 2019. Both appeals are before the D.C. Circuit Court. The impact of these petitions could be more stringent requirements for the operation of NOx emission controls at these plants. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nGlobal Climate Change\nOn September 17, 2019, Duke Energy announced an updated climate strategy with a new goal of net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. Timelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, will vary in each state in which the company operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' GHG emissions consist primarily of CO2 and result primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. In 2019, the Duke Energy Registrants' power plants emitted approximately 93 million tons of CO2. Future levels of CO2 emissions will be influenced by variables that include fuel prices, market prices, compliance with new or existing regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand and the technologies deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet the customer demand.\n MD&A OTHER MATTERS \nThe Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO2 emissions over time. Actions have included the retirement of 47 coal-fired Electric Generating Units with a combined generating capacity of 5,425 MW. Much of that capacity has been replaced with state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated. Duke Energy also has made investments to expand its portfolio of wind and solar projects, increase EE offerings and invest in its zero-CO2 emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO2 emissions. Between 2005 and 2019, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO2 emissions from their electricity generation by 39%, which potentially lowers the exposure to any future mandatory CO2 emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement. Duke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce CO2 emissions, including EE, wind, solar, storage and nuclear. Duke Energy will adjust to evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability that customers expect. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO2 limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants' operations impossible.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IRPs. These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the company's thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, EE and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.\nFor a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price on CO2 emissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential regulation of CO2 emissions. Incorporating a price on CO2 emissions in the IRPs allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One of the challenges with using a CO2 price, especially in the absence of a clear and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants typically use a range of potential CO2 prices to reflect a range of potential policy outcomes.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems by modernizing the electric grid through smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding and applying lessons learned from previous storms to restoration efforts. The Duke Energy Registrants' electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on-site to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity.\nState Legislation\nIn July 2017, the North Carolina General Assembly passed House Bill 589, and it was subsequently signed into law by the governor. The law includes, among other things, overall reform of the application of PURPA for new solar projects in the state, a requirement for the utility to procure approximately 2,600 MW of renewable energy through a competitive bidding process and recovery of costs related to the competitive bidding process through the fuel clause and a competitive procurement rider.\nIn accordance with the provisions of HB 589, total procurement was changed based upon how much generation with no economic dispatch or curtailment occurs over the procurement period. Most of this type of generation is solar procured under PURPA. Based upon the current forecasted amount of such generation that will occur over procurement period, Duke Energy estimates the total under HB 589 competitive procurement will be approximately 1,500 to 2,000 MW.\nBased on an independent evaluation process, Duke Energy will own or purchase a total of 551 MW of renewable energy from projects under the North Carolina's CPRE program. The process used was approved by the NCUC to select projects that would deliver the lowest cost renewable energy for customers. Five Duke Energy projects, totaling about 190 MW, were selected during the competitive bidding process. Duke Energy has completed the contracting process for the winning projects. A second tranche for CPRE opened in October 2019 and bids are due by March 9, 2020; the current target date for execution of the contracts is the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn various states, legislation is being considered to allow third-party sales of electricity. Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these initiatives.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting

driven by favorable rate case outcomes, cost management efforts, and growth in Commercial Renewables. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and financing costs.\n\n- Duke Energy has taken steps to strengthen its balance sheet, including issuing $2B of preferred equity and $2.5B of common stock equity expected to settle by end of 2020. This supports Duke's plans to deliver 4-6% annual EPS growth through 2024.\n\n- Duke invested $11.4B in 2019 across its business segments, with increases in Electric Utilities, Gas Utilities, and Commercial Renewables. Total capital expenditures are projected at $11.8B in 2020.\n\n- Duke has a net-zero carbon goal for its electric generation by 2050. It plans to continue retiring coal plants, investing in renewables and grid modernization, and reducing emissions.\n\n- Key regulatory matters include coal ash basin closure plans in Carolinas, rate cases in several states, and storm cost recovery. Outcomes could significantly impact future financial results.\n\n- Duke manages risks related to commodity prices, interest rates, credit, and market volatility through robust policies, monitoring, and financial instruments where appropriate.\n\nIn summary, Duke delivered earnings growth in 2019 while advancing its clean energy strategy and strengthening finances. Future results depend greatly on constructive regulatory outcomes and effectively managing risk."}
