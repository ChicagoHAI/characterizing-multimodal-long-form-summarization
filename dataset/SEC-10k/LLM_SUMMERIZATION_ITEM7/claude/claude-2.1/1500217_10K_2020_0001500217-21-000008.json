Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and our company\u201d mean American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d or elsewhere in this document. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nOur Company\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops high quality office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties in attractive, high-barrier-to-entry markets in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington, Texas, and Hawaii. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was comprised of nine office properties; twelve retail shopping centers; a mixed-use property consisting of a 369-room all-suite hotel and a retail shopping center; and six multifamily properties. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and construction in progress. Our core markets include San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Oregon, Bellevue, Washington and Oahu, Hawaii. Our company, as the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, has control of our Operating Partnership and owned 78.8% of our Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of our Operating Partnership.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nOn November 5, 2010, we formed American Assets Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is wholly owned by our Operating Partnership and which we refer to as our services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a regular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries.\nOutlook\nWe seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-store portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our properties are located in some of the nation's most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, which we believe allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities.\nWe intend to opportunistically pursue projects in our development pipeline including future phases of La Jolla Commons, Lloyd District Portfolio, as well as other redevelopments at Waikele Center. The commencement of these developments is based on, among other things, market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk adjusted financial returns. Our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors, including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition. We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available\ncash, mortgage loans and/or borrowings under our second amended and restated credit facility, which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt.\nCOVID-19\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our tenants and business partners. We are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries, including the United States, has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, as cases of COVID-19 have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. Certain states and cities, including where we own properties, have development sites and where our principal place of business is located, have also reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, \"stay-at-home\" orders or shelter in place\u201d rules, social distancing measures, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of construction projects that may continue. The Company cannot predict when restrictions or social distancing measures currently in place will expire. Even after certain of such restrictions are lifted or reduced, the willingness of customers to visit certain of out tenants' businesses may be reduced due to lingering concerns regarding the continued risk of COVID-19 transmission and heightened sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of other diseases. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly, including industries in which the Company and our tenants operate. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our tenants and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have collected to date approximately 99% of office rents, 78% of retail rents (including retail component of Waikiki Beach Walk) and 96% of multifamily rents that were due during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received and executed a significant amount of rent deferment requests from various tenants, primarily within the retail segment, as a result of COVID-19. We are evaluating each tenant rent deferment request on an individual basis, considering a number of factors. Not all rent deferment requests will ultimately result in executed lease modification agreements. As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into lease modifications that resulted in COVID-19 adjustments (including rent deferrals and other monetary lease concessions) for approximately $13.4 million or 4% of the rent originally contracted for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe believe the company's financial condition and liquidity are currently strong. Although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company's future results, we believe our efficient business model and ongoing steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet has positioned to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our tenants, vendors, and other third-party relationships, and developing new opportunities for growth. Due to COVID-19, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on the Company's results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. See Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d - The ongoing COVID-10 pandemic, and restrictions intended to prevent its spread, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders.\"\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law to provide widespread emergency relief for the economy and to provide aid to corporations. The CARES Act includes several significant provisions related to taxes, refundable payroll tax credits and deferment of social security payments. We continue to evaluate the relief options available under the CARES Act. We will continue to assess these options, and any subsequent legislation or other relief packages, including the accompanying restrictions on our business, as the pandemic continues to evolve.\nSame-store\nWe have provided certain information on a total portfolio, same-store and redevelopment same-store basis. Information provided on a same-store basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods\nbeing compared, properties under development, properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations. Information provided on a redevelopment same-store basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared. Same-store and redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in eliminating disparities due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's stabilized and redevelopment properties, as applicable. Additionally, redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance.\nWhile there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically reclassify significant development, redevelopment or expansion properties to same-store properties once they are stabilized. Properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of (1) reaching 90% occupancy or (2) four quarters following a property's inclusion in operating real estate. We typically remove properties from same-store properties when the development, redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year. Acquired properties are classified to same-store properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable period(s) and the properties are not under significant development or expansion.\nIn our determination of same-store and redevelopment same-store properties, Waikele Center and One Beach Street have been identified as a same-store redevelopment property due to significant construction activity. Retail same-store net operating income decreased approximately 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to 2019. Retail redevelopment same-store net operating income decreased approximately 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to 2019.\nBelow is a summary of our same-store composition for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2019, Torrey Point was reclassified to same-store properties as the property was placed into operations and became available for occupancy in August 2018. One Beach Street was reclassified to non-same-store properties when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to redevelopment activity to renovate the property. Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy Suites\u2122 Hotel is classified as a non-same-store properties due to spalling repair activity disrupting the hotel portion of the property's operations. Waikele Center is classified as a non-same-store property due to significant redevelopment activity. La Jolla Commons is classified as a non-same-store property, as it was acquired on June 20, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2018, Pacific Ridge Apartments and Gateway Marketplace were reclassified to same-store properties as the entities were acquired on April 28, 2017 and July 6, 2017, respectively, and are comparable for the year ended December 31, 2019. Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy Suites\u2122 Hotel was reclassified to non-same-store properties when compared to the designation for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to spalling repair activity disrupting the hotel portion of the properties operations. Additionally, Waikele Center was transferred out of same-store properties due to significant redevelopment activity for the year ended December 31, 2018. Torrey Point was placed into operations and became available for occupancy in August 2018 and will be classified as a non-same-store property until it becomes stabilized and comparable.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-Store </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Same Store </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Properties </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redevelopment Same-Store </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Development Properties </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Base\nRental income consists of scheduled rent charges, straight-line rent adjustments and the amortization of above market and below market rents acquired. We also derive revenue from tenant recoveries and other property revenues, including parking income, lease termination fees, late fees, storage rents and other miscellaneous property revenues.\nOffice Leases. Our office portfolio included nine properties with a total of approximately 3.4 million rentable square feet available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 93.0% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the office segment contributed 51.5% of our total revenue. Historically, we have leased office properties to tenants primarily on a full service gross or a modified gross basis and to a limited extent on a triple-net lease basis. We expect to continue to do so in the future. A full-service gross or modified gross lease has a base year expense stop, whereby the tenant pays a stated amount of certain expenses as part of the rent payment, while future increases in property operating expenses (above the base year stop) are billed to the tenant based on such tenant's proportionate square footage of the property. The increased property operating expenses billed are reflected as operating expenses and amounts recovered from tenants are reflected as rental income in the statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we signed 42 office leases for 338,062 square feet with an average rent of $47.20 per square foot during the initial year of the lease term. Of the leases, 33 represent comparable leases where there was a prior tenant, with an increase of 18.6% in cash basis rent and an increase of 21.9% in straight-line rent compared to the prior leases.\nRetail Leases. Our retail portfolio included twelve properties with a total of approximately 3.1 million rentable square feet available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 90.7% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the retail segment contributed 25.6%, of our total revenue. Historically, we have leased retail properties to tenants primarily on a triple-net lease basis, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. In a triple-net lease, the tenant is responsible for all property taxes and operating expenses. As such, the base rent payment does not include any operating expense, but rather all such expenses, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, are billed to the tenant. The full amount of the expenses for this lease type, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, is reflected in operating expenses, and the reimbursement is reflected as rental income in the statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we signed 76 retail leases for 314,147 square feet with an average rent of $32.40 per square foot during the initial year of the lease term, including leases signed for the retail portion of our mixed-use property. Of the leases, 69 represent comparable leases where there was a prior tenant, with an decrease of 7.4% in cash basis rent and an decrease of 2.4% in straight-line rent compared to the prior leases.\nMultifamily Leases. Our multifamily portfolio included six apartment properties, as well as an RV resort, with a total of 2,112 units (including 122 RV spaces) available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 86.2% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the multifamily segment contributed 14.6% of our total revenue. Our multifamily leases, other than at our RV Resort, generally have lease terms ranging from 7 to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms. Tenants normally pay a base rental amount, usually quoted in terms of a monthly rate for the respective unit. Spaces at the RV Resort can be rented at a daily, weekly, or monthly rate. The average monthly base rent per leased unit as of December 31, 2020 was $2,238, compared to $2,099 at December 31, 2019.\nMixed-Use Property Revenue. Our mixed-use property consists of approximately 97,000 rentable square feet of retail space and a 369-room all-suite hotel. Revenue from the mixed-use property consists of revenue earned from retail leases, and revenue earned from the hotel, which consists of room revenue, food and beverage services, parking and other guest services. As of December 31, 2020, the retail portion of the property was 89.2% leased, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the hotel had an average occupancy of 51.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the mixed-use segment contributed 8.2%, of our total revenue. We have leased the retail portion of such property to tenants primarily on a triple-net lease basis, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. As such, the base rent payment under such leases does not include any operating expenses, but rather all such expenses, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, are billed to the tenant. Rooms at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property are rented on a nightly basis.\nLeasing\nOur same-store growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage, allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. Furthermore, we believe the locations of our properties and diversified portfolio will mitigate some of the potentially negative impact of the current economic environment. However, in the short-term due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a meaningful negative impact on certain of our tenants operations and ability to pay rent, primarily in the retail sector; and any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we signed 42 office leases for a total of 338,062 square feet of office space including 297,739 square feet of comparable space leases, at an average rental rate increase of 18.6% on a cash\nbasis and an average rental increase of 21.9% on a straight-line basis. New office leases for comparable spaces were signed for 9,744 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 7.5% on a cash basis and an average rental rate increase of 11.9% on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for 287,995 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 19.0% on a cash basis and increase of 22.3% on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were $35.44 per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were $15.03 per square foot of office space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we signed 76 retail leases for a total of 314,147 square feet of retail space including 303,490 square feet of comparable space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant), a decrease of 7.4% on a cash basis and a decrease of 2.4% on a straight-line basis. New retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for 12,155 square feet at an average rental rate decrease of 12.8% on a cash basis and an average rental rate decrease of 4.4% on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for 291,335 square feet at an average rental rate decrease of 7.1% on a cash basis and a decrease of 2.3% on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were $27.64 per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were $6.13 per square foot of retail space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nThe rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and, in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In some instances, management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease, but may also include base building costs (i.e., expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.\nThe leases signed in 2020 generally become effective over the following year, though some may not become effective until 2022. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. However, we believe that these increases do provide information about the tenant/landlord relationship and the potential fluctuations we may achieve in rental income over time.\nIn 2021, we believe our leasing volume will be below our historical averages with overall decreases in rental income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. In addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in the section above entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nOur leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Substantially all such leases contain fixed rent escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease. Base rents are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease, net of valuation adjustments, based on management's assessment of credit, collection and other business risks. When we determine that we are the owner of tenant improvements and the tenant has reimbursed us for a portion or all of the tenant improvement costs, we consider the amount paid to be additional rent, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. For first generation tenants, in instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us, revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. When we determine that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, tenant allowances are recorded as lease incentives and we commence revenue recognition and lease incentive amortization when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin. Percentage rents, which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants, are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible. Real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred.\nOther property income includes parking income, general excise tax billed to tenants, fees charged to tenants at our multifamily properties and food and beverage sales at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. Other property income is recognized when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our services to customers. For a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. Lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the later of the termination date or the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the lease termination, including, without limitation, payment of all lease termination fees. When a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement.\nCurrent accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements. Accounts receivable from straight-line rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement.\nWe recognize revenue on the hotel portion of our mixed-use property from the rental of hotel rooms and guest services when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control when the rooms are occupied and services have been provided. Food and beverage sales are recognized when the customer has been served or at the time the transaction occurs. Revenue from room rental is included in rental revenue on the statement of income. Revenue from other sales and services provided is included in other property income on the statement of income.\nWe make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management. The collectability of receivables is affected by numerous different factors including current economic trends, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tenant's businesses and changes in tenants' payment patterns, tenant bankruptcies, the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable, tenants' recent and historical financial and operating results, changes in our tenants' credit ratings, communications between our operating personnel and tenants, the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If our assessment of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to collect substantially all rents, we recognize a charge to rental income and limit our rental income to the lesser of lease income on a straight-line basis plus variable rents when they become accruable or cash collected. If we change our conclusion regarding the probability of collecting rent payments required by a lessee, we may recognize an adjustment to rental income in the period we make a change to our prior conclusion.\nDue to the nature of the accounts receivable from straight-line rents, the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year. Our experience relative to unbilled straight-line rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications, bankruptcies and other factors. Accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured. Any changes to our conclusion regarding these assessments of collectability would have a direct impact on our net income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided lease concessions to certain tenants, primarily within the retail segment, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the form of rent deferrals and abatements. These lease concessions generally included an increase in our rights as a lessor. We assess each lease concession and determine whether it represents a lease modifications under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"). The FASB staff provided guidance that it would be acceptable for entities to make an election to account for lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with how those concessions would be accounted for under ASC 842 as though enforceable rights and obligations for those concessions existed in the existing lease contract, as long as the concession does not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee, thereby not requiring entities to apply lease modification guidance to those contracts. The Company has elected to account for such COVID-19 concessions as lease modifications As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into lease modifications that resulted in COVID-19 adjustments (including rent deferrals and other monetary lease concessions) for approximately $13.4 million or 4% of the rent originally contracted for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEffective January 1, 2018, (upon the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) sales of real estate are recognized generally upon the transfer of control, which usually occurs when the real estate is legally sold. Prior to January 1, 2018, sales of real estate were recognized only when sufficient down payments had been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership had been transferred to the buyer and we had no significant continuing involvement. The application of these criteria can be complex and required us to make assumptions. We believe the relevant criteria were met for all real estate sold during the periods presented.\nReal Estate\nDepreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us. Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range generally from 30 years to a maximum of 40 years on buildings and major improvements. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the undepreciated balance of any tenant improvements are written off if they are replaced or have no future value. Our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income. If expected useful lives of our real estate assets were shortened, we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period, resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis.\nAcquisitions of properties are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance on acquisitions and business combinations. Our methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values, replacement cost and appraised values. When we acquire operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated to land and buildings, intangibles such as in-place leases, and to current assets and liabilities acquired, if any. Such valuations include a consideration of the noncancelable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal period(s). The fair values associated with below market renewal options are determined based on a review of several qualitative and quantitative factors on a lease-by-lease basis at acquisition to determine whether it is probable that the tenant would exercise its option to renew the lease agreement. These factors include: (1) the type of tenant in relation to the property it occupies, (2) the quality of the tenant, including the tenant's long term business prospects, and (3) whether the fixed rate renewal option was sufficiently lower than the fair rental of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable such that it would appear to be reasonably assured that the tenant would exercise the option to renew. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment, and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. If we were to allocate more value to the buildings, as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases.\nThe value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The value of above and below market leases associated with the original noncancelable lease terms are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective noncancelable lease periods and are reflected as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease or the lease is not renewed, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income and amortization expense. The value of the leases associated with below market lease renewal options that are likely to be exercised are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods. We make assumptions and estimates related to below market\nlease renewal options, which impact revenue in the period in which the renewal options are exercised and could result in significant increases to revenue if the renewal options are not exercised at which time the related below market lease liabilities would be written off as an increase to revenue.\nTransaction costs related to the acquisition of a business, such as broker fees, transfer taxes, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses\u201d in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For asset acquisitions not meeting the definition of a business, transaction costs are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost.\nCapitalized Costs\nCertain external and internal costs directly related to the development and redevelopment of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, interest, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. We capitalize costs under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy. The determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord-owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements, but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction.\nWe capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of $8.4 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of $56.7 million and $95.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInterest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use as noted above. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period. We capitalized interest costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of $1.1 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSegment

The decrease in maintenance capital expenditures in our office portfolio was primarily related to The Landmark at One Market and Torrey Reserve Campus building renovations in the prior period, partially offset by building renovations at Torrey Point, Solana Crossing and Lloyd District Portfolio during 2020.\nThe increase in new development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to costs incurred for the development of the La Jolla Commons development parcel.\nOur capital expenditures during 2021 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of our development, held for development and construction in progress properties. While the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, we expect expenditures incurred in 2021 will increase from 2020 in connection with our development activities at La Jolla Commons and renovations at One Beach Street, and completion of the Google LLC's tenant improvements at The Landmark at One Market.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt.\nAny interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. Our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not match, such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and LIBOR rate. In addition, we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. However, management does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. If a cash flow hedge is deemed\nineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review for impairment on a property by property basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written-down to fair value. The calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. Since our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. Actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. These estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.\nProperties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell. Although our strategy is to hold our properties over the long-term, if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to fair value and such loss could be material.\nNo impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gains, and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Provided we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, our taxable income generally would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders.\nWe, together with one of our subsidiaries, have elected to treat such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes.\nProperty Acquisitions and Dispositions\n2020 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring 2020, there were no acquisitions or dispositions.\n2019 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nOn June 20, 2019, we acquired La Jolla Commons, consisting of two office towers totaling approximately 724,000 square feet, an entitled development parcel and two parking structures, located in San Diego, California. The purchase price was approximately $525 million, less seller credits of (i) approximately $11.5 million for speculative lease-up, (ii) approximately $4.2 million for assumed contractual liabilities (iii) and approximately $1.7 million for closing prorations, excluding closing costs of approximately $0.2 million.\nThe property was acquired with proceeds from an underwritten public offering and borrowings under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility.\nOn May 22, 2019, we sold Solana Beach - Highway 101. The property is located in San Diego, California and was previously included in our retail segment. The sales price of this property of approximately $9.4 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately $9.4 million. Accordingly, we recorded a gain on sale of approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n2018 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring 2018, there were no acquisitions or dispositions.\nResults of Operations\nFor our discussion of results of operations, we have provided information on a total portfolio and same-store basis.\nFor our discussion related to the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2020.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, our operating portfolio was comprised of 28 office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties with an aggregate of approximately 6.6 million rentable square feet of office and retail space (including mixed-use retail space), 2,112 residential units (including 122 RV spaces) and a 369-room hotel. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and construction in progress.

The same-store portfolio excludes: (i) Waikele Center due to significant redevelopment activity; (ii) La Jolla Commons as it was acquired on June 20, 2019; (iii) One Beach Street due to the renovation of the building; (iv) Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy SuitesTM Hotel due to significant spalling repair activity; and (v) land held for development.\nTotal office rental revenue increased $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental rental revenue of approximately $22.2 million during the period. The increase in total office rental revenue is partially offset by the decrease in rental revenue of approximately $2.9 million at One Beach Street due to the expiration of leases to allow for the modernization of the property. Same-store office rental revenue increased $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher annualized base rents at The Landmark at One Market, Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Point and Torrey Reserve Campus. The increase in same-store office rental revenue is partially offset by the decrease at First & Main primarily due to the increase in collectability related adjustments of straight-line rent receivables of approximately $0.8 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probably for certain tenants.\nTotal retail rental revenue decreased $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $2.8 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $5.9 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at Alamo Quarry Market, Carmel Mountain Plaza, Del Monte Center, Waikele Center and The Shops at Kalakaua as the temporary store closures or restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the financial condition of certain tenants to deteriorate. Additionally, the decrease in total retail rental revenue is also attributable to rent concessions of approximately $3.1 million and a decrease in cost reimbursements of approximately $4.0 million due to a real estate tax refund at Alamo Quarry Market and decrease in rental expenses for the retail segment. The decrease in total retail rental revenue was partially offset by higher annualized base rent at Waikele Center related to the Safeway lease and higher annualized base rent at Carmel Mountain Plaza related to the At Home Stores lease.\nMultifamily rental revenue decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in average occupancy to 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 92.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in occupancy primarily related to Hassalo on Eighth - Residential. The decrease in average occupancy is partially offset by the increase in average base rent per unit to $2,166 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,077 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nMixed-use rental revenue decreased $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy through hotel reservation cancellations and travel restrictions during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which led to a decrease in average occupancy and revenue per available room to 51.3% and $127 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 91.7% and $299 for year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce rental revenue at the hotel portion of the mixed-use property through the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public. The decrease in mixed-use rental revenue is also attributed to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $5.7 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $1.2 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at the retail portion of our mixed-use property.\nOther property income. Other property income decreased $8.6 million, or 38%, to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Same-store office other property income decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in parking garage income at City Center Bellevue, Lloyd District Portfolio and First & Main during the period as the \"stay-at home\" order issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter caused a substantial portion of our tenants employees and their guests to continue to partially work from home during the period.\nRetail other property income decreased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to non-cash lease termination fees recognized in connection with the termination of a ground lease, and the ground lessee's surrender of, the former Sears building at Carmel Mountain Plaza during the prior period. The decrease in retail other property income was partially offset by an increase in lease termination fees received at Alamo Quarry Market, Del Monte Center, Carmel Country Plaza and Geary Marketplace during the period.\nMultifamily other property income decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in parking garage income at Hassalo on Eighth - Residential and late fees.\nMixed-use other property income decreased $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy beginning in March 2020 which led to a decrease in excise tax and food & beverage revenue at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and a decrease in parking garage income at the retail portion of our mixed-use property. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce mixed-use other property income through at least the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public.\nProperty Expenses\nTotal Property Expenses.

Same-store office rental expenses decreased $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to utilities expense, janitorial services and supplies, and repairs and maintenance as the \"stay-at home\" order issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter caused a substantial portion of our tenants' employees to continue to work from home during the period. The decrease in same-store office rental expenses was partially offset by the increase in sublease expense related to the Annex Lease extension option exercised in March 2020, an increase in commercial rent tax at The Landmark at One Market, and an increase in insurance expense during the period.\nTotal retail rental expenses decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in utilities, day porter services, repairs and maintenance and trash services during the period as temporary store closures and restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused reduced demand for these rental expenses. The decrease in retail rental expense was partially offset by the increase in insurance expense during the period.\nMultifamily rental expensed increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to personnel compensation expenses, utilities, janitorial services and supplies, security services and insurance expense during the period.\nMixed-use rental expenses decreased $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in hotel room expenses, marketing expenses, and general excise tax expenses at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property during the period.

Property operating income by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>Same-Store Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td>60,906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,065) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,880) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily </td> <td>28,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,950) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,950) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mixed-Use </td> <td>4,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,973) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(83) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>234,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,307) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,584) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal office property operating income increased $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental property operating income of $17.0 million during the period. The increase in total office property operating income was partially offset by a decrease in property operating income of approximately $2.7 million at One Beach Street due to the expiration of leases to allow for the modernization of the property. Same-store property operating income increased $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher annualized base rents at The Landmark at One Market, Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Point and Torrey Reserve Campus.\nRetail property operating income decreased $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in collectability related adjustment of rent receivables of approximately $2.8 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $5.9 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at Alamo Quarry Market, Carmel Mountain Plaza, Del Monte Center, Waikele Center and The Shops at Kalakaua as the temporary store closures or restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the financial condition of certain tenants to deteriorate. Additionally, the decrease in total retail property operating income was also due to the non-cash lease termination fees recognized in connection with the termination of a ground lease, and the ground lessee's surrender of, the former Sears building at Carmel Mountain Plaza during the prior period. Additionally, the decrease in total retail rental revenue is also attributable to rent concessions of approximately $3.1 million. The decrease in total retail property operating income was partially offset by the net property operating income related to the real estate tax refund at Alamo Quarry Market during the period and higher annualized base rent at Waikele Center related to the Safeway lease and higher annualized base rent at Carmel Mountain Plaza related to the At Home Stores lease.\nMultifamily property operating income decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in average occupancy to 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 92.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and increase in real estate tax assessments at Pacific Ridge, Lomas Palisades, and Hassalo on Eighth - Residential, and an increase in personnel compensation expenses, utilities, security services and insurance expense during the period.\nMixed-use property operating income decreased $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy through hotel reservation cancellations and travel restrictions during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which led to a decrease in average occupancy and revenue per available room to 51.3% and $127 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 91.7% and $299 for year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce property operating income at the hotel portion of the mixed-use property through the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public. The decrease in mixed-use property operating income is also attributed to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $5.7 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $1.2 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at the retail portion of our mixed-use property.\nOther\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $1.7 million, or 7%, to $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs, furlough expense for our hotel staff and legal costs.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12.1 million, or 13%, to $108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental depreciation and\namortization of $7.2 million during the period and higher depreciation and amortization at Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Reserve Campus, Torrey Point, and Waikele Center due to tenant improvements that were put into service in 2019 and 2020.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.6 million, or 1%, to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the mortgages on Torrey Reserve - VCI, VCII, VCIII, Solana Crossing I-II, and Solana Beach Towne Centre on March 2, 2020 and a lower weighted average interest rate on our line of credit in 2020 partially offset by the closing of our Series G Notes on July 30, 2019.\nGain on sale of real estate. Gain on sale of real estate of $0.6 million during 2019 relates to our sale of Solana Beach - Highway 101 on May 22, 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other (expense) income, net increased $0.6 million, or 466%, to other income, net of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to other expense, net of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in income tax expense related to lower taxable income for our taxable REIT subsidiary partially offset by a decrease in interest and investment income attributed to lower weighted average interest rates on our money market balances.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\u201d section, the term the company\u201d refers only to American Assets Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, and excludes the Operating Partnership and all other subsidiaries.\nThe company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the company is the parent company and sole general partner, and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because the company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole.\nThe company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership. The company itself does not have any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the company owned an approximate 78.8% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 21.3% are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of the company's directors and executive officers. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies. The company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as the company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.\nThe liquidity of the company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the company. The primary cash requirement of the company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. The company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt, as discussed further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger the company's guarantee obligations, then the company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, the company's only significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.\nWe believe the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured line of credit, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the company and, in turn, for the company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, the company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the company, which would in turn, adversely affect the company's ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to the company's stockholders, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, general and administrative expenses, funding construction projects, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.\nThe company may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem the Operating Partnership's outstanding debt, the company's shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nFor the company to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. While historically the company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited\ncircumstances, the company's own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. The company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership's working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.\nThe company is a well-known seasoned issuer. As circumstances warrant, the company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. When the company receives proceeds from preferred or common equity issuances, it is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for preferred or common partnership units of the operating partnership. The operating partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, to develop new or existing properties, to acquire properties or for general corporate purposes.\nIn January 2021, the company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC, which became effective upon filing and which replaced the prior Form S-3ASR that was filed with the SEC in February 2018. The universal shelf registration statement may permit the company from time to time to offer and sell equity securities of the company. However, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete any such offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets, among others.\nOn May 27, 2015, the company entered into a new at-the-market, or ATM, equity program with five sales agents under which the company may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million (the \"2015 ATM Program\"). The sales of shares of the company's common stock made through the 2015 ATM Program were made in at-the-market\u201d offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2020, the company has issued 6,930,002 shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $38.58 for gross cash proceeds of $267.4 million under the ATM equity program, in the aggregate.\nThe company intends to use the net proceeds to fund development or redevelopment activities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our amended and restated credit facility or other debt financing obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities and/or for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the company had the capacity to issue up to an additional $132.6 million in shares of common stock under the 2015 ATM Program. Actual future sales will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the company's common stock and the company's capital needs. The company has no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the 2015 ATM Program.\nOn June 14, 2019, we issued and sold 10,925,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $44.75 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $472.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\u201d section, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Operating Partnership and American Assets Trust, Inc. together with their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. American Assets Trust, Inc. is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. Because we operate on a consolidated basis with American Assets Trust, Inc., the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis.\nDue to the nature of our business, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is used for the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service and dividends to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders and our unitholders. As a REIT, American Assets Trust, Inc. must generally make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of its net taxable income.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, regular debt service requirements, dividend payments to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders required to maintain its REIT status, distributions to our other unitholders, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, borrowings available under our second amended and restated credit facility.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions, tenant improvements and capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements to pay scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and capital improvements with net cash from operations, long-term\nsecured and unsecured indebtedness and, if necessary, the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and capital improvements using our second amended and restated credit facility pending permanent financing. We believe that we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt, noting that during the third quarter of 2015, the company obtained investment grade credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service (Baa3), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (BBB), and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot be assured that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company. Given our past ability to access the capital markets, we expect debt or equity to be available to us. Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of future development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy.\nOur overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of developments. Our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and/or our second amended and restated credit facility.\nWe intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment grade debt ratings. In the short and long term, we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity, unsecured and/or secured debt financings, and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure.\nWe currently believe that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our ATM equity program, our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table outlines the timing of required payments related to our commitments as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Within\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>2 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>4 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments on long-term indebtedness </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,311,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit (1)\n</td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments </td> <td>235,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease </td> <td>36,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant-related commitments </td> <td>45,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction-related commitments </td> <td>14,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,743,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>359,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>576,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The unsecured revolving line of credit has a capacity of $350 million plus an accordion feature that may allow us to increase the availability thereunder up to an additional $250 million, subject to meeting specified requirements and obtaining additional commitments from lenders. The unsecured revolving line of credit initially matures on January 9, 2022 and we have two six-month options to extend its maturity to January, 9, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash Flows\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $139.0 million and $109.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $26.8 million to $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $153.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to the decrease in rental revenue from the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and a decrease in rent collections from our retail portfolio.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $530.1 million to $69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $599.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019 in the prior period.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $497.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the underwritten public offering that settled on June 14, 2019.\nNet Operating Income\nNet Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance). NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expense, other non-property income and losses, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nNOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds of the property owner, (2) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, or (3) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our retail, office, multifamily or mixed-use properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is intended to be captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 computed in accordance with GAAP (in thousands):\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>234,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209,412 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>(26,581) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,871) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,784) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>(108,292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96,205) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107,093) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(53,440) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54,008) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,248) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(122) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,202 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds from Operations\nWe present FFO because we consider FFO an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nFFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent (in thousands, except per share and share data):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,202 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Real estate depreciation and amortization </td> <td>108,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,093 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Gain on sale of real estate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(633) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations, as defined by NAREIT </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,295 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Nonforfeitable dividends on restricted stock awards </td> <td>(377) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(376) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(305) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common stock and units </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,990 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per diluted share/unit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.09 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of common shares and units, diluted (1)\n</td> <td>76,122,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,788,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,139,437 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the weighted average common shares used to compute FFO per diluted share include unvested restricted stock awards that are subject to time vesting, as the vesting of the restricted stock awards is dilutive in the computation of FFO per diluted\nshares, but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted EPS for the periods. Diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable.\nInflation\nSubstantially all of our office and retail leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above. In addition, our multifamily leases (other than at our RV resort where spaces can be rented at a daily, weekly or monthly rate) generally have lease terms ranging from seven to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms, and generally allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal, which we believe reduces our exposure to the effects of inflation. For the hotel portion of our mixed-use property, we possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise room rates.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and our company\u201d mean American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d or elsewhere in this document. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nOur Company\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops high quality office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties in attractive, high-barrier-to-entry markets in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington, Texas, and Hawaii. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was comprised of nine office properties; twelve retail shopping centers; a mixed-use property consisting of a 369-room all-suite hotel and a retail shopping center; and six multifamily properties. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and construction in progress. Our core markets include San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Oregon, Bellevue, Washington and Oahu, Hawaii. Our company, as the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, has control of our Operating Partnership and owned 78.8% of our Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of our Operating Partnership.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nOn November 5, 2010, we formed American Assets Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is wholly owned by our Operating Partnership and which we refer to as our services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a regular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries.\nOutlook\nWe seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-store portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our properties are located in some of the nation's most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, which we believe allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities.\nWe intend to opportunistically pursue projects in our development pipeline including future phases of La Jolla Commons, Lloyd District Portfolio, as well as other redevelopments at Waikele Center. The commencement of these developments is based on, among other things, market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk adjusted financial returns. Our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors, including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition. We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available\ncash, mortgage loans and/or borrowings under our second amended and restated credit facility, which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt.\nCOVID-19\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our tenants and business partners. We are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries, including the United States, has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, as cases of COVID-19 have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. Certain states and cities, including where we own properties, have development sites and where our principal place of business is located, have also reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, \"stay-at-home\" orders or shelter in place\u201d rules, social distancing measures, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of construction projects that may continue. The Company cannot predict when restrictions or social distancing measures currently in place will expire. Even after certain of such restrictions are lifted or reduced, the willingness of customers to visit certain of out tenants' businesses may be reduced due to lingering concerns regarding the continued risk of COVID-19 transmission and heightened sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of other diseases. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly, including industries in which the Company and our tenants operate. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our tenants and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have collected to date approximately 99% of office rents, 78% of retail rents (including retail component of Waikiki Beach Walk) and 96% of multifamily rents that were due during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received and executed a significant amount of rent deferment requests from various tenants, primarily within the retail segment, as a result of COVID-19. We are evaluating each tenant rent deferment request on an individual basis, considering a number of factors. Not all rent deferment requests will ultimately result in executed lease modification agreements. As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into lease modifications that resulted in COVID-19 adjustments (including rent deferrals and other monetary lease concessions) for approximately $13.4 million or 4% of the rent originally contracted for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe believe the company's financial condition and liquidity are currently strong. Although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company's future results, we believe our efficient business model and ongoing steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet has positioned to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our tenants, vendors, and other third-party relationships, and developing new opportunities for growth. Due to COVID-19, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on the Company's results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. See Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d - The ongoing COVID-10 pandemic, and restrictions intended to prevent its spread, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders.\"\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law to provide widespread emergency relief for the economy and to provide aid to corporations. The CARES Act includes several significant provisions related to taxes, refundable payroll tax credits and deferment of social security payments. We continue to evaluate the relief options available under the CARES Act. We will continue to assess these options, and any subsequent legislation or other relief packages, including the accompanying restrictions on our business, as the pandemic continues to evolve.\nSame-store\nWe have provided certain information on a total portfolio, same-store and redevelopment same-store basis. Information provided on a same-store basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods\nbeing compared, properties under development, properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations. Information provided on a redevelopment same-store basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared. Same-store and redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in eliminating disparities due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's stabilized and redevelopment properties, as applicable. Additionally, redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance.\nWhile there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically reclassify significant development, redevelopment or expansion properties to same-store properties once they are stabilized. Properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of (1) reaching 90% occupancy or (2) four quarters following a property's inclusion in operating real estate. We typically remove properties from same-store properties when the development, redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year. Acquired properties are classified to same-store properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable period(s) and the properties are not under significant development or expansion.\nIn our determination of same-store and redevelopment same-store properties, Waikele Center and One Beach Street have been identified as a same-store redevelopment property due to significant construction activity. Retail same-store net operating income decreased approximately 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to 2019. Retail redevelopment same-store net operating income decreased approximately 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to 2019.\nBelow is a summary of our same-store composition for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2019, Torrey Point was reclassified to same-store properties as the property was placed into operations and became available for occupancy in August 2018. One Beach Street was reclassified to non-same-store properties when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to redevelopment activity to renovate the property. Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy Suites\u2122 Hotel is classified as a non-same-store properties due to spalling repair activity disrupting the hotel portion of the property's operations. Waikele Center is classified as a non-same-store property due to significant redevelopment activity. La Jolla Commons is classified as a non-same-store property, as it was acquired on June 20, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2018, Pacific Ridge Apartments and Gateway Marketplace were reclassified to same-store properties as the entities were acquired on April 28, 2017 and July 6, 2017, respectively, and are comparable for the year ended December 31, 2019. Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy Suites\u2122 Hotel was reclassified to non-same-store properties when compared to the designation for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to spalling repair activity disrupting the hotel portion of the properties operations. Additionally, Waikele Center was transferred out of same-store properties due to significant redevelopment activity for the year ended December 31, 2018. Torrey Point was placed into operations and became available for occupancy in August 2018 and will be classified as a non-same-store property until it becomes stabilized and comparable.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-Store </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Same Store </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Properties </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redevelopment Same-Store </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Development Properties </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Base\nRental income consists of scheduled rent charges, straight-line rent adjustments and the amortization of above market and below market rents acquired. We also derive revenue from tenant recoveries and other property revenues, including parking income, lease termination fees, late fees, storage rents and other miscellaneous property revenues.\nOffice Leases. Our office portfolio included nine properties with a total of approximately 3.4 million rentable square feet available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 93.0% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the office segment contributed 51.5% of our total revenue. Historically, we have leased office properties to tenants primarily on a full service gross or a modified gross basis and to a limited extent on a triple-net lease basis. We expect to continue to do so in the future. A full-service gross or modified gross lease has a base year expense stop, whereby the tenant pays a stated amount of certain expenses as part of the rent payment, while future increases in property operating expenses (above the base year stop) are billed to the tenant based on such tenant's proportionate square footage of the property. The increased property operating expenses billed are reflected as operating expenses and amounts recovered from tenants are reflected as rental income in the statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we signed 42 office leases for 338,062 square feet with an average rent of $47.20 per square foot during the initial year of the lease term. Of the leases, 33 represent comparable leases where there was a prior tenant, with an increase of 18.6% in cash basis rent and an increase of 21.9% in straight-line rent compared to the prior leases.\nRetail Leases. Our retail portfolio included twelve properties with a total of approximately 3.1 million rentable square feet available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 90.7% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the retail segment contributed 25.6%, of our total revenue. Historically, we have leased retail properties to tenants primarily on a triple-net lease basis, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. In a triple-net lease, the tenant is responsible for all property taxes and operating expenses. As such, the base rent payment does not include any operating expense, but rather all such expenses, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, are billed to the tenant. The full amount of the expenses for this lease type, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, is reflected in operating expenses, and the reimbursement is reflected as rental income in the statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we signed 76 retail leases for 314,147 square feet with an average rent of $32.40 per square foot during the initial year of the lease term, including leases signed for the retail portion of our mixed-use property. Of the leases, 69 represent comparable leases where there was a prior tenant, with an decrease of 7.4% in cash basis rent and an decrease of 2.4% in straight-line rent compared to the prior leases.\nMultifamily Leases. Our multifamily portfolio included six apartment properties, as well as an RV resort, with a total of 2,112 units (including 122 RV spaces) available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 86.2% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the multifamily segment contributed 14.6% of our total revenue. Our multifamily leases, other than at our RV Resort, generally have lease terms ranging from 7 to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms. Tenants normally pay a base rental amount, usually quoted in terms of a monthly rate for the respective unit. Spaces at the RV Resort can be rented at a daily, weekly, or monthly rate. The average monthly base rent per leased unit as of December 31, 2020 was $2,238, compared to $2,099 at December 31, 2019.\nMixed-Use Property Revenue. Our mixed-use property consists of approximately 97,000 rentable square feet of retail space and a 369-room all-suite hotel. Revenue from the mixed-use property consists of revenue earned from retail leases, and revenue earned from the hotel, which consists of room revenue, food and beverage services, parking and other guest services. As of December 31, 2020, the retail portion of the property was 89.2% leased, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the hotel had an average occupancy of 51.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the mixed-use segment contributed 8.2%, of our total revenue. We have leased the retail portion of such property to tenants primarily on a triple-net lease basis, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. As such, the base rent payment under such leases does not include any operating expenses, but rather all such expenses, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, are billed to the tenant. Rooms at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property are rented on a nightly basis.\nLeasing\nOur same-store growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage, allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. Furthermore, we believe the locations of our properties and diversified portfolio will mitigate some of the potentially negative impact of the current economic environment. However, in the short-term due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a meaningful negative impact on certain of our tenants operations and ability to pay rent, primarily in the retail sector; and any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we signed 42 office leases for a total of 338,062 square feet of office space including 297,739 square feet of comparable space leases, at an average rental rate increase of 18.6% on a cash\nbasis and an average rental increase of 21.9% on a straight-line basis. New office leases for comparable spaces were signed for 9,744 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 7.5% on a cash basis and an average rental rate increase of 11.9% on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for 287,995 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 19.0% on a cash basis and increase of 22.3% on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were $35.44 per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were $15.03 per square foot of office space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we signed 76 retail leases for a total of 314,147 square feet of retail space including 303,490 square feet of comparable space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant), a decrease of 7.4% on a cash basis and a decrease of 2.4% on a straight-line basis. New retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for 12,155 square feet at an average rental rate decrease of 12.8% on a cash basis and an average rental rate decrease of 4.4% on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for 291,335 square feet at an average rental rate decrease of 7.1% on a cash basis and a decrease of 2.3% on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were $27.64 per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were $6.13 per square foot of retail space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nThe rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and, in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In some instances, management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease, but may also include base building costs (i.e., expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.\nThe leases signed in 2020 generally become effective over the following year, though some may not become effective until 2022. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. However, we believe that these increases do provide information about the tenant/landlord relationship and the potential fluctuations we may achieve in rental income over time.\nIn 2021, we believe our leasing volume will be below our historical averages with overall decreases in rental income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. In addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in the section above entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nOur leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Substantially all such leases contain fixed rent escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease. Base rents are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease, net of valuation adjustments, based on management's assessment of credit, collection and other business risks. When we determine that we are the owner of tenant improvements and the tenant has reimbursed us for a portion or all of the tenant improvement costs, we consider the amount paid to be additional rent, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. For first generation tenants, in instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us, revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. When we determine that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, tenant allowances are recorded as lease incentives and we commence revenue recognition and lease incentive amortization when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin. Percentage rents, which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants, are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible. Real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred.\nOther property income includes parking income, general excise tax billed to tenants, fees charged to tenants at our multifamily properties and food and beverage sales at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. Other property income is recognized when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our services to customers. For a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. Lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the later of the termination date or the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the lease termination, including, without limitation, payment of all lease termination fees. When a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement.\nCurrent accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements. Accounts receivable from straight-line rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement.\nWe recognize revenue on the hotel portion of our mixed-use property from the rental of hotel rooms and guest services when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control when the rooms are occupied and services have been provided. Food and beverage sales are recognized when the customer has been served or at the time the transaction occurs. Revenue from room rental is included in rental revenue on the statement of income. Revenue from other sales and services provided is included in other property income on the statement of income.\nWe make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management. The collectability of receivables is affected by numerous different factors including current economic trends, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tenant's businesses and changes in tenants' payment patterns, tenant bankruptcies, the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable, tenants' recent and historical financial and operating results, changes in our tenants' credit ratings, communications between our operating personnel and tenants, the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If our assessment of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to collect substantially all rents, we recognize a charge to rental income and limit our rental income to the lesser of lease income on a straight-line basis plus variable rents when they become accruable or cash collected. If we change our conclusion regarding the probability of collecting rent payments required by a lessee, we may recognize an adjustment to rental income in the period we make a change to our prior conclusion.\nDue to the nature of the accounts receivable from straight-line rents, the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year. Our experience relative to unbilled straight-line rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications, bankruptcies and other factors. Accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured. Any changes to our conclusion regarding these assessments of collectability would have a direct impact on our net income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided lease concessions to certain tenants, primarily within the retail segment, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the form of rent deferrals and abatements. These lease concessions generally included an increase in our rights as a lessor. We assess each lease concession and determine whether it represents a lease modifications under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"). The FASB staff provided guidance that it would be acceptable for entities to make an election to account for lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with how those concessions would be accounted for under ASC 842 as though enforceable rights and obligations for those concessions existed in the existing lease contract, as long as the concession does not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee, thereby not requiring entities to apply lease modification guidance to those contracts. The Company has elected to account for such COVID-19 concessions as lease modifications As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into lease modifications that resulted in COVID-19 adjustments (including rent deferrals and other monetary lease concessions) for approximately $13.4 million or 4% of the rent originally contracted for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEffective January 1, 2018, (upon the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) sales of real estate are recognized generally upon the transfer of control, which usually occurs when the real estate is legally sold. Prior to January 1, 2018, sales of real estate were recognized only when sufficient down payments had been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership had been transferred to the buyer and we had no significant continuing involvement. The application of these criteria can be complex and required us to make assumptions. We believe the relevant criteria were met for all real estate sold during the periods presented.\nReal Estate\nDepreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us. Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range generally from 30 years to a maximum of 40 years on buildings and major improvements. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the undepreciated balance of any tenant improvements are written off if they are replaced or have no future value. Our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income. If expected useful lives of our real estate assets were shortened, we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period, resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis.\nAcquisitions of properties are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance on acquisitions and business combinations. Our methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values, replacement cost and appraised values. When we acquire operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated to land and buildings, intangibles such as in-place leases, and to current assets and liabilities acquired, if any. Such valuations include a consideration of the noncancelable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal period(s). The fair values associated with below market renewal options are determined based on a review of several qualitative and quantitative factors on a lease-by-lease basis at acquisition to determine whether it is probable that the tenant would exercise its option to renew the lease agreement. These factors include: (1) the type of tenant in relation to the property it occupies, (2) the quality of the tenant, including the tenant's long term business prospects, and (3) whether the fixed rate renewal option was sufficiently lower than the fair rental of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable such that it would appear to be reasonably assured that the tenant would exercise the option to renew. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment, and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. If we were to allocate more value to the buildings, as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases.\nThe value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The value of above and below market leases associated with the original noncancelable lease terms are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective noncancelable lease periods and are reflected as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease or the lease is not renewed, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income and amortization expense. The value of the leases associated with below market lease renewal options that are likely to be exercised are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods. We make assumptions and estimates related to below market\nlease renewal options, which impact revenue in the period in which the renewal options are exercised and could result in significant increases to revenue if the renewal options are not exercised at which time the related below market lease liabilities would be written off as an increase to revenue.\nTransaction costs related to the acquisition of a business, such as broker fees, transfer taxes, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses\u201d in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For asset acquisitions not meeting the definition of a business, transaction costs are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost.\nCapitalized Costs\nCertain external and internal costs directly related to the development and redevelopment of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, interest, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. We capitalize costs under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy. The determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord-owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements, but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction.\nWe capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of $8.4 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of $56.7 million and $95.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInterest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use as noted above. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period. We capitalized interest costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of $1.1 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSegment capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The decrease in maintenance capital expenditures in our office portfolio was primarily related to The Landmark at One Market and Torrey Reserve Campus building renovations in the prior period, partially offset by building renovations at Torrey Point, Solana Crossing and Lloyd District Portfolio during 2020.\nThe increase in new development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to costs incurred for the development of the La Jolla Commons development parcel.\nOur capital expenditures during 2021 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of our development, held for development and construction in progress properties. While the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, we expect expenditures incurred in 2021 will increase from 2020 in connection with our development activities at La Jolla Commons and renovations at One Beach Street, and completion of the Google LLC's tenant improvements at The Landmark at One Market.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt.\nAny interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. Our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not match, such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and LIBOR rate. In addition, we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. However, management does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. If a cash flow hedge is deemed\nineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review for impairment on a property by property basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written-down to fair value. The calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. Since our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. Actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. These estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.\nProperties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell. Although our strategy is to hold our properties over the long-term, if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to fair value and such loss could be material.\nNo impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gains, and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Provided we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, our taxable income generally would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders.\nWe, together with one of our subsidiaries, have elected to treat such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes.\nProperty Acquisitions and Dispositions\n2020 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring 2020, there were no acquisitions or dispositions.\n2019 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nOn June 20, 2019, we acquired La Jolla Commons, consisting of two office towers totaling approximately 724,000 square feet, an entitled development parcel and two parking structures, located in San Diego, California. The purchase price was approximately $525 million, less seller credits of (i) approximately $11.5 million for speculative lease-up, (ii) approximately $4.2 million for assumed contractual liabilities (iii) and approximately $1.7 million for closing prorations, excluding closing costs of approximately $0.2 million.\nThe property was acquired with proceeds from an underwritten public offering and borrowings under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility.\nOn May 22, 2019, we sold Solana Beach - Highway 101. The property is located in San Diego, California and was previously included in our retail segment. The sales price of this property of approximately $9.4 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately $9.4 million. Accordingly, we recorded a gain on sale of approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n2018 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring 2018, there were no acquisitions or dispositions.\nResults of Operations\nFor our discussion of results of operations, we have provided information on a total portfolio and same-store basis.\nFor our discussion related to the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2020.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, our operating portfolio was comprised of 28 office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties with an aggregate of approximately 6.6 million rentable square feet of office and retail space (including mixed-use retail space), 2,112 residential units (including 122 RV spaces) and a 369-room hotel.

The same-store portfolio excludes: (i) Waikele Center due to significant redevelopment activity; (ii) La Jolla Commons as it was acquired on June 20, 2019; (iii) One Beach Street due to the renovation of the building; (iv) Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy SuitesTM Hotel due to significant spalling repair activity; and (v) land held for development.\nTotal office rental revenue increased $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental rental revenue of approximately $22.2 million during the period. The increase in total office rental revenue is partially offset by the decrease in rental revenue of approximately $2.9 million at One Beach Street due to the expiration of leases to allow for the modernization of the property. Same-store office rental revenue increased $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher annualized base rents at The Landmark at One Market, Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Point and Torrey Reserve Campus. The increase in same-store office rental revenue is partially offset by the decrease at First & Main primarily due to the increase in collectability related adjustments of straight-line rent receivables of approximately $0.8 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probably for certain tenants.\nTotal retail rental revenue decreased $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $2.8 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $5.9 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at Alamo Quarry Market, Carmel Mountain Plaza, Del Monte Center, Waikele Center and The Shops at Kalakaua as the temporary store closures or restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the financial condition of certain tenants to deteriorate. Additionally, the decrease in total retail rental revenue is also attributable to rent concessions of approximately $3.1 million and a decrease in cost reimbursements of approximately $4.0 million due to a real estate tax refund at Alamo Quarry Market and decrease in rental expenses for the retail segment. The decrease in total retail rental revenue was partially offset by higher annualized base rent at Waikele Center related to the Safeway lease and higher annualized base rent at Carmel Mountain Plaza related to the At Home Stores lease.\nMultifamily rental revenue decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in average occupancy to 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 92.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in occupancy primarily related to Hassalo on Eighth - Residential. The decrease in average occupancy is partially offset by the increase in average base rent per unit to $2,166 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,077 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nMixed-use rental revenue decreased $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy through hotel reservation cancellations and travel restrictions during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which led to a decrease in average occupancy and revenue per available room to 51.3% and $127 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 91.7% and $299 for year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce rental revenue at the hotel portion of the mixed-use property through the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public. The decrease in mixed-use rental revenue is also attributed to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $5.7 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $1.2 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at the retail portion of our mixed-use property.\nOther property income. Other property income decreased $8.6 million, or 38%, to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Same-store office other property income decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in parking garage income at City Center Bellevue, Lloyd District Portfolio and First & Main during the period as the \"stay-at home\" order issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter caused a substantial portion of our tenants employees and their guests to continue to partially work from home during the period.\nRetail other property income decreased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to non-cash lease termination fees recognized in connection with the termination of a ground lease, and the ground lessee's surrender of, the former Sears building at Carmel Mountain Plaza during the prior period. The decrease in retail other property income was partially offset by an increase in lease termination fees received at Alamo Quarry Market, Del Monte Center, Carmel Country Plaza and Geary Marketplace during the period.\nMultifamily other property income decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in parking garage income at Hassalo on Eighth - Residential and late fees.\nMixed-use other property income decreased $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy beginning in March 2020 which led to a decrease in excise tax and food & beverage revenue at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and a decrease in parking garage income at the retail portion of our mixed-use property. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce mixed-use other property income through at least the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public.\nProperty Expenses\nTotal Property Expenses.

The decrease in same-store office rental expenses was partially offset by the increase in sublease expense related to the Annex Lease extension option exercised in March 2020, an increase in commercial rent tax at The Landmark at One Market, and an increase in insurance expense during the period.\nTotal retail rental expenses decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in utilities, day porter services, repairs and maintenance and trash services during the period as temporary store closures and restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused reduced demand for these rental expenses. The decrease in retail rental expense was partially offset by the increase in insurance expense during the period.\nMultifamily rental expensed increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to personnel compensation expenses, utilities, janitorial services and supplies, security services and insurance expense during the period.\nMixed-use rental expenses decreased $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in hotel room expenses, marketing expenses, and general excise tax expenses at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property during the period. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce rental expenses at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property through at least the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public. Additionally, the decrease in mixed-use rental expenses is also due to the decrease of personnel compensation, repairs and maintenance, and utilities expenses at the retail portion of our mixed-use property during the period.\nReal Estate Taxes. Real estate tax expense increased $1.9 million, or 5%, to $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Real estate tax expense by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>Same-Store Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td>11,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,642) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,865) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily </td> <td>6,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mixed-Use </td> <td>4,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,905) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal office real estate taxes increased $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental real estate taxes of approximately $3.2 million. Same-store office real estate taxes increased $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in the assessed values of City Center Bellevue, The Landmark at One Market, Lloyd District Portfolio and Torrey Reserve Campus.\nRetail real estate taxes decreased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a net real estate tax refund of approximately $2.3 million at Alamo Quarry Market for the tax assessment for 2016 - 2018. The decrease in retail real estate taxes was partially offset by an increase in the assessed values of Waikele Center.\nMultifamily real estate taxes increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in assessed values at Pacific Ridge Apartments, Lomas Palisades and Hassalo on Eighth - Residential.\nMixed-use real estate taxes increased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in assessed values for the hotel portion of our mixed-use property.\nProperty Operating Income.\nProperty operating income decreased $11.3 million, or 5%, to $223.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $234.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase in total office property operating income was partially offset by a decrease in property operating income of approximately $2.7 million at One Beach Street due to the expiration of leases to allow for the modernization of the property. Same-store property operating income increased $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher annualized base rents at The Landmark at One Market, Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Point and Torrey Reserve Campus.\nRetail property operating income decreased $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in collectability related adjustment of rent receivables of approximately $2.8 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $5.9 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at Alamo Quarry Market, Carmel Mountain Plaza, Del Monte Center, Waikele Center and The Shops at Kalakaua as the temporary store closures or restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the financial condition of certain tenants to deteriorate. Additionally, the decrease in total retail property operating income was also due to the non-cash lease termination fees recognized in connection with the termination of a ground lease, and the ground lessee's surrender of, the former Sears building at Carmel Mountain Plaza during the prior period. Additionally, the decrease in total retail rental revenue is also attributable to rent concessions of approximately $3.1 million. The decrease in total retail property operating income was partially offset by the net property operating income related to the real estate tax refund at Alamo Quarry Market during the period and higher annualized base rent at Waikele Center related to the Safeway lease and higher annualized base rent at Carmel Mountain Plaza related to the At Home Stores lease.\nMultifamily property operating income decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in average occupancy to 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 92.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and increase in real estate tax assessments at Pacific Ridge, Lomas Palisades, and Hassalo on Eighth - Residential, and an increase in personnel compensation expenses, utilities, security services and insurance expense during the period.\nMixed-use property operating income decreased $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy through hotel reservation cancellations and travel restrictions during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which led to a decrease in average occupancy and revenue per available room to 51.3% and $127 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 91.7% and $299 for year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce property operating income at the hotel portion of the mixed-use property through the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public. The decrease in mixed-use property operating income is also attributed to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $5.7 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $1.2 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at the retail portion of our mixed-use property.\nOther\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $1.7 million, or 7%, to $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs, furlough expense for our hotel staff and legal costs.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12.1 million, or 13%, to $108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental depreciation and\namortization of $7.2 million during the period and higher depreciation and amortization at Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Reserve Campus, Torrey Point, and Waikele Center due to tenant improvements that were put into service in 2019 and 2020.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.6 million, or 1%, to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the mortgages on Torrey Reserve - VCI, VCII, VCIII, Solana Crossing I-II, and Solana Beach Towne Centre on March 2, 2020 and a lower weighted average interest rate on our line of credit in 2020 partially offset by the closing of our Series G Notes on July 30, 2019.\nGain on sale of real estate. Gain on sale of real estate of $0.6 million during 2019 relates to our sale of Solana Beach - Highway 101 on May 22, 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other (expense) income, net increased $0.6 million, or 466%, to other income, net of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to other expense, net of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in income tax expense related to lower taxable income for our taxable REIT subsidiary partially offset by a decrease in interest and investment income attributed to lower weighted average interest rates on our money market balances.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\u201d section, the term the company\u201d refers only to American Assets Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, and excludes the Operating Partnership and all other subsidiaries.\nThe company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the company is the parent company and sole general partner, and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because the company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole.\nThe company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership. The company itself does not have any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the company owned an approximate 78.8% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 21.3% are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of the company's directors and executive officers. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies. The company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as the company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.\nThe liquidity of the company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the company. The primary cash requirement of the company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. The company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt, as discussed further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger the company's guarantee obligations, then the company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, the company's only significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.\nWe believe the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured line of credit, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the company and, in turn, for the company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, the company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the company, which would in turn, adversely affect the company's ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to the company's stockholders, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, general and administrative expenses, funding construction projects, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.\nThe company may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem the Operating Partnership's outstanding debt, the company's shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nFor the company to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. While historically the company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited\ncircumstances, the company's own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. The company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership's working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.\nThe company is a well-known seasoned issuer. As circumstances warrant, the company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. When the company receives proceeds from preferred or common equity issuances, it is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for preferred or common partnership units of the operating partnership. The operating partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, to develop new or existing properties, to acquire properties or for general corporate purposes.\nIn January 2021, the company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC, which became effective upon filing and which replaced the prior Form S-3ASR that was filed with the SEC in February 2018. The universal shelf registration statement may permit the company from time to time to offer and sell equity securities of the company. However, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete any such offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets, among others.\nOn May 27, 2015, the company entered into a new at-the-market, or ATM, equity program with five sales agents under which the company may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million (the \"2015 ATM Program\"). The sales of shares of the company's common stock made through the 2015 ATM Program were made in at-the-market\u201d offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2020, the company has issued 6,930,002 shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $38.58 for gross cash proceeds of $267.4 million under the ATM equity program, in the aggregate.\nThe company intends to use the net proceeds to fund development or redevelopment activities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our amended and restated credit facility or other debt financing obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities and/or for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the company had the capacity to issue up to an additional $132.6 million in shares of common stock under the 2015 ATM Program. Actual future sales will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the company's common stock and the company's capital needs. The company has no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the 2015 ATM Program.\nOn June 14, 2019, we issued and sold 10,925,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $44.75 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $472.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\u201d section, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Operating Partnership and American Assets Trust, Inc. together with their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. American Assets Trust, Inc. is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. Because we operate on a consolidated basis with American Assets Trust, Inc., the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis.\nDue to the nature of our business, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is used for the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service and dividends to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders and our unitholders. As a REIT, American Assets Trust, Inc. must generally make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of its net taxable income.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, regular debt service requirements, dividend payments to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders required to maintain its REIT status, distributions to our other unitholders, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, borrowings available under our second amended and restated credit facility.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions, tenant improvements and capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements to pay scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and capital improvements with net cash from operations, long-term\nsecured and unsecured indebtedness and, if necessary, the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and capital improvements using our second amended and restated credit facility pending permanent financing. We believe that we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt, noting that during the third quarter of 2015, the company obtained investment grade credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service (Baa3), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (BBB), and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot be assured that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company. Given our past ability to access the capital markets, we expect debt or equity to be available to us. Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of future development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy.\nOur overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of developments. Our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and/or our second amended and restated credit facility.\nWe intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment grade debt ratings. In the short and long term, we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity, unsecured and/or secured debt financings, and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure.\nWe currently believe that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our ATM equity program, our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table outlines the timing of required payments related to our commitments as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Within\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>2 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>4 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments on long-term indebtedness </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,311,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit (1)\n</td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments </td> <td>235,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease </td> <td>36,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant-related commitments </td> <td>45,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction-related commitments </td> <td>14,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,743,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>359,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>576,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The unsecured revolving line of credit has a capacity of $350 million plus an accordion feature that may allow us to increase the availability thereunder up to an additional $250 million, subject to meeting specified requirements and obtaining additional commitments from lenders. The unsecured revolving line of credit initially matures on January 9, 2022 and we have two six-month options to extend its maturity to January, 9, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash Flows\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $139.0 million and $109.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $26.8 million to $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $153.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to the decrease in rental revenue from the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and a decrease in rent collections from our retail portfolio.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $530.1 million to $69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $599.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019 in the prior period.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $497.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the underwritten public offering that settled on June 14, 2019.\nNet Operating Income\nNet Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance). NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expense, other non-property income and losses, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nNOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds of the property owner, (2) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, or (3) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our retail, office, multifamily or mixed-use properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is intended to be captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 computed in accordance with GAAP (in thousands):\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>234,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209,412 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>(26,581) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,871) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,784) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>(108,292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96,205) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107,093) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(53,440) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54,008) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,248) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(122) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,202 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds from Operations\nWe present FFO because we consider FFO an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nFFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent (in thousands, except per share and share data):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,202 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Real estate depreciation and amortization </td> <td>108,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,093 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Gain on sale of real estate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(633) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations, as defined by NAREIT </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,295 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Nonforfeitable dividends on restricted stock awards </td> <td>(377) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(376) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(305) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common stock and units </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,990 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per diluted share/unit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.09 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of common shares and units, diluted (1)\n</td> <td>76,122,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,788,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,139,437 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the weighted average common shares used to compute FFO per diluted share include unvested restricted stock awards that are subject to time vesting, as the vesting of the restricted stock awards is dilutive in the computation of FFO per diluted\nshares, but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted EPS for the periods. Diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable.\nInflation\nSubstantially all of our office and retail leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above. In addition, our multifamily leases (other than at our RV resort where spaces can be rented at a daily, weekly or monthly rate) generally have lease terms ranging from seven to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms, and generally allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal, which we believe reduces our exposure to the effects of inflation. For the hotel portion of our mixed-use property, we possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise room rates.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and our company\u201d mean American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d or elsewhere in this document. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nOur Company\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops high quality office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties in attractive, high-barrier-to-entry markets in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington, Texas, and Hawaii. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was comprised of nine office properties; twelve retail shopping centers; a mixed-use property consisting of a 369-room all-suite hotel and a retail shopping center; and six multifamily properties. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and construction in progress. Our core markets include San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Oregon, Bellevue, Washington and Oahu, Hawaii. Our company, as the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, has control of our Operating Partnership and owned 78.8% of our Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of our Operating Partnership.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nOn November 5, 2010, we formed American Assets Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is wholly owned by our Operating Partnership and which we refer to as our services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a regular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries.\nOutlook\nWe seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-store portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our properties are located in some of the nation's most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, which we believe allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities.\nWe intend to opportunistically pursue projects in our development pipeline including future phases of La Jolla Commons, Lloyd District Portfolio, as well as other redevelopments at Waikele Center. The commencement of these developments is based on, among other things, market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk adjusted financial returns. Our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors, including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition. We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available\ncash, mortgage loans and/or borrowings under our second amended and restated credit facility, which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt.\nCOVID-19\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our tenants and business partners. We are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries, including the United States, has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, as cases of COVID-19 have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. Certain states and cities, including where we own properties, have development sites and where our principal place of business is located, have also reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, \"stay-at-home\" orders or shelter in place\u201d rules, social distancing measures, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of construction projects that may continue. The Company cannot predict when restrictions or social distancing measures currently in place will expire. Even after certain of such restrictions are lifted or reduced, the willingness of customers to visit certain of out tenants' businesses may be reduced due to lingering concerns regarding the continued risk of COVID-19 transmission and heightened sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of other diseases. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly, including industries in which the Company and our tenants operate. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our tenants and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have collected to date approximately 99% of office rents, 78% of retail rents (including retail component of Waikiki Beach Walk) and 96% of multifamily rents that were due during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received and executed a significant amount of rent deferment requests from various tenants, primarily within the retail segment, as a result of COVID-19. We are evaluating each tenant rent deferment request on an individual basis, considering a number of factors. Not all rent deferment requests will ultimately result in executed lease modification agreements. As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into lease modifications that resulted in COVID-19 adjustments (including rent deferrals and other monetary lease concessions) for approximately $13.4 million or 4% of the rent originally contracted for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe believe the company's financial condition and liquidity are currently strong. Although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company's future results, we believe our efficient business model and ongoing steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet has positioned to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our tenants, vendors, and other third-party relationships, and developing new opportunities for growth. Due to COVID-19, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on the Company's results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. See Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d - The ongoing COVID-10 pandemic, and restrictions intended to prevent its spread, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders.\"\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law to provide widespread emergency relief for the economy and to provide aid to corporations. The CARES Act includes several significant provisions related to taxes, refundable payroll tax credits and deferment of social security payments. We continue to evaluate the relief options available under the CARES Act. We will continue to assess these options, and any subsequent legislation or other relief packages, including the accompanying restrictions on our business, as the pandemic continues to evolve.\nSame-store\nWe have provided certain information on a total portfolio, same-store and redevelopment same-store basis. Information provided on a same-store basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods\nbeing compared, properties under development, properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations. Information provided on a redevelopment same-store basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared. Same-store and redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in eliminating disparities due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's stabilized and redevelopment properties, as applicable. Additionally, redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance.\nWhile there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically reclassify significant development, redevelopment or expansion properties to same-store properties once they are stabilized. Properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of (1) reaching 90% occupancy or (2) four quarters following a property's inclusion in operating real estate. We typically remove properties from same-store properties when the development, redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year. Acquired properties are classified to same-store properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable period(s) and the properties are not under significant development or expansion.\nIn our determination of same-store and redevelopment same-store properties, Waikele Center and One Beach Street have been identified as a same-store redevelopment property due to significant construction activity. Retail same-store net operating income decreased approximately 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to 2019. Retail redevelopment same-store net operating income decreased approximately 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to 2019.\nBelow is a summary of our same-store composition for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2019, Torrey Point was reclassified to same-store properties as the property was placed into operations and became available for occupancy in August 2018. One Beach Street was reclassified to non-same-store properties when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to redevelopment activity to renovate the property. Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy Suites\u2122 Hotel is classified as a non-same-store properties due to spalling repair activity disrupting the hotel portion of the property's operations. Waikele Center is classified as a non-same-store property due to significant redevelopment activity. La Jolla Commons is classified as a non-same-store property, as it was acquired on June 20, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2018, Pacific Ridge Apartments and Gateway Marketplace were reclassified to same-store properties as the entities were acquired on April 28, 2017 and July 6, 2017, respectively, and are comparable for the year ended December 31, 2019. Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy Suites\u2122 Hotel was reclassified to non-same-store properties when compared to the designation for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to spalling repair activity disrupting the hotel portion of the properties operations. Additionally, Waikele Center was transferred out of same-store properties due to significant redevelopment activity for the year ended December 31, 2018. Torrey Point was placed into operations and became available for occupancy in August 2018 and will be classified as a non-same-store property until it becomes stabilized and comparable.\n\nRevenue Base\nRental income consists of scheduled rent charges, straight-line rent adjustments and the amortization of above market and below market rents acquired. We also derive revenue from tenant recoveries and other property revenues, including parking income, lease termination fees, late fees, storage rents and other miscellaneous property revenues.\nOffice Leases. Our office portfolio included nine properties with a total of approximately 3.4 million rentable square feet available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 93.0% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the office segment contributed 51.5% of our total revenue. Historically, we have leased office properties to tenants primarily on a full service gross or a modified gross basis and to a limited extent on a triple-net lease basis. We expect to continue to do so in the future. A full-service gross or modified gross lease has a base year expense stop, whereby the tenant pays a stated amount of certain expenses as part of the rent payment, while future increases in property operating expenses (above the base year stop) are billed to the tenant based on such tenant's proportionate square footage of the property. The increased property operating expenses billed are reflected as operating expenses and amounts recovered from tenants are reflected as rental income in the statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we signed 42 office leases for 338,062 square feet with an average rent of $47.20 per square foot during the initial year of the lease term. Of the leases, 33 represent comparable leases where there was a prior tenant, with an increase of 18.6% in cash basis rent and an increase of 21.9% in straight-line rent compared to the prior leases.\nRetail Leases. Our retail portfolio included twelve properties with a total of approximately 3.1 million rentable square feet available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 90.7% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the retail segment contributed 25.6%, of our total revenue. Historically, we have leased retail properties to tenants primarily on a triple-net lease basis, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. In a triple-net lease, the tenant is responsible for all property taxes and operating expenses. As such, the base rent payment does not include any operating expense, but rather all such expenses, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, are billed to the tenant. The full amount of the expenses for this lease type, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, is reflected in operating expenses, and the reimbursement is reflected as rental income in the statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we signed 76 retail leases for 314,147 square feet with an average rent of $32.40 per square foot during the initial year of the lease term, including leases signed for the retail portion of our mixed-use property. Of the leases, 69 represent comparable leases where there was a prior tenant, with an decrease of 7.4% in cash basis rent and an decrease of 2.4% in straight-line rent compared to the prior leases.\nMultifamily Leases. Our multifamily portfolio included six apartment properties, as well as an RV resort, with a total of 2,112 units (including 122 RV spaces) available for lease as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 86.2% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the multifamily segment contributed 14.6% of our total revenue. Our multifamily leases, other than at our RV Resort, generally have lease terms ranging from 7 to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms. Tenants normally pay a base rental amount, usually quoted in terms of a monthly rate for the respective unit. Spaces at the RV Resort can be rented at a daily, weekly, or monthly rate. The average monthly base rent per leased unit as of December 31, 2020 was $2,238, compared to $2,099 at December 31, 2019.\nMixed-Use Property Revenue. Our mixed-use property consists of approximately 97,000 rentable square feet of retail space and a 369-room all-suite hotel. Revenue from the mixed-use property consists of revenue earned from retail leases, and revenue earned from the hotel, which consists of room revenue, food and beverage services, parking and other guest services. As of December 31, 2020, the retail portion of the property was 89.2% leased, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the hotel had an average occupancy of 51.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the mixed-use segment contributed 8.2%, of our total revenue. We have leased the retail portion of such property to tenants primarily on a triple-net lease basis, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. As such, the base rent payment under such leases does not include any operating expenses, but rather all such expenses, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, are billed to the tenant. Rooms at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property are rented on a nightly basis.\nLeasing\nOur same-store growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage, allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. Furthermore, we believe the locations of our properties and diversified portfolio will mitigate some of the potentially negative impact of the current economic environment. However, in the short-term due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a meaningful negative impact on certain of our tenants operations and ability to pay rent, primarily in the retail sector; and any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we signed 42 office leases for a total of 338,062 square feet of office space including 297,739 square feet of comparable space leases, at an average rental rate increase of 18.6% on a cash\nbasis and an average rental increase of 21.9% on a straight-line basis. New office leases for comparable spaces were signed for 9,744 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 7.5% on a cash basis and an average rental rate increase of 11.9% on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for 287,995 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 19.0% on a cash basis and increase of 22.3% on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were $35.44 per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were $15.03 per square foot of office space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we signed 76 retail leases for a total of 314,147 square feet of retail space including 303,490 square feet of comparable space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant), a decrease of 7.4% on a cash basis and a decrease of 2.4% on a straight-line basis. New retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for 12,155 square feet at an average rental rate decrease of 12.8% on a cash basis and an average rental rate decrease of 4.4% on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for 291,335 square feet at an average rental rate decrease of 7.1% on a cash basis and a decrease of 2.3% on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were $27.64 per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. There were $6.13 per square foot of retail space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nThe rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and, in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In some instances, management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease, but may also include base building costs (i.e., expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.\nThe leases signed in 2020 generally become effective over the following year, though some may not become effective until 2022. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. However, we believe that these increases do provide information about the tenant/landlord relationship and the potential fluctuations we may achieve in rental income over time.\nIn 2021, we believe our leasing volume will be below our historical averages with overall decreases in rental income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. In addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in the section above entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nOur leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Substantially all such leases contain fixed rent escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease. Base rents are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease, net of valuation adjustments, based on management's assessment of credit, collection and other business risks. When we determine that we are the owner of tenant improvements and the tenant has reimbursed us for a portion or all of the tenant improvement costs, we consider the amount paid to be additional rent, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. For first generation tenants, in instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us, revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. When we determine that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, tenant allowances are recorded as lease incentives and we commence revenue recognition and lease incentive amortization when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin. Percentage rents, which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants, are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible. Real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred.\nOther property income includes parking income, general excise tax billed to tenants, fees charged to tenants at our multifamily properties and food and beverage sales at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. Other property income is recognized when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our services to customers. For a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. Lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the later of the termination date or the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the lease termination, including, without limitation, payment of all lease termination fees. When a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement.\nCurrent accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements. Accounts receivable from straight-line rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement.\nWe recognize revenue on the hotel portion of our mixed-use property from the rental of hotel rooms and guest services when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control when the rooms are occupied and services have been provided. Food and beverage sales are recognized when the customer has been served or at the time the transaction occurs. Revenue from room rental is included in rental revenue on the statement of income. Revenue from other sales and services provided is included in other property income on the statement of income.\nWe make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management. The collectability of receivables is affected by numerous different factors including current economic trends, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tenant's businesses and changes in tenants' payment patterns, tenant bankruptcies, the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable, tenants' recent and historical financial and operating results, changes in our tenants' credit ratings, communications between our operating personnel and tenants, the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If our assessment of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to collect substantially all rents, we recognize a charge to rental income and limit our rental income to the lesser of lease income on a straight-line basis plus variable rents when they become accruable or cash collected. If we change our conclusion regarding the probability of collecting rent payments required by a lessee, we may recognize an adjustment to rental income in the period we make a change to our prior conclusion.\nDue to the nature of the accounts receivable from straight-line rents, the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year. Our experience relative to unbilled straight-line rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications, bankruptcies and other factors. Accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured. Any changes to our conclusion regarding these assessments of collectability would have a direct impact on our net income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided lease concessions to certain tenants, primarily within the retail segment, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the form of rent deferrals and abatements. These lease concessions generally included an increase in our rights as a lessor. We assess each lease concession and determine whether it represents a lease modifications under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"). The FASB staff provided guidance that it would be acceptable for entities to make an election to account for lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with how those concessions would be accounted for under ASC 842 as though enforceable rights and obligations for those concessions existed in the existing lease contract, as long as the concession does not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee, thereby not requiring entities to apply lease modification guidance to those contracts. The Company has elected to account for such COVID-19 concessions as lease modifications As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into lease modifications that resulted in COVID-19 adjustments (including rent deferrals and other monetary lease concessions) for approximately $13.4 million or 4% of the rent originally contracted for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEffective January 1, 2018, (upon the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) sales of real estate are recognized generally upon the transfer of control, which usually occurs when the real estate is legally sold. Prior to January 1, 2018, sales of real estate were recognized only when sufficient down payments had been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership had been transferred to the buyer and we had no significant continuing involvement. The application of these criteria can be complex and required us to make assumptions. We believe the relevant criteria were met for all real estate sold during the periods presented.\nReal Estate\nDepreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us. Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range generally from 30 years to a maximum of 40 years on buildings and major improvements. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the undepreciated balance of any tenant improvements are written off if they are replaced or have no future value. Our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income. If expected useful lives of our real estate assets were shortened, we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period, resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis.\nAcquisitions of properties are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance on acquisitions and business combinations. Our methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values, replacement cost and appraised values. When we acquire operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated to land and buildings, intangibles such as in-place leases, and to current assets and liabilities acquired, if any. Such valuations include a consideration of the noncancelable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal period(s). The fair values associated with below market renewal options are determined based on a review of several qualitative and quantitative factors on a lease-by-lease basis at acquisition to determine whether it is probable that the tenant would exercise its option to renew the lease agreement. These factors include: (1) the type of tenant in relation to the property it occupies, (2) the quality of the tenant, including the tenant's long term business prospects, and (3) whether the fixed rate renewal option was sufficiently lower than the fair rental of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable such that it would appear to be reasonably assured that the tenant would exercise the option to renew. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment, and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. If we were to allocate more value to the buildings, as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases.\nThe value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The value of above and below market leases associated with the original noncancelable lease terms are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective noncancelable lease periods and are reflected as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease or the lease is not renewed, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income and amortization expense. The value of the leases associated with below market lease renewal options that are likely to be exercised are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods. We make assumptions and estimates related to below market\nlease renewal options, which impact revenue in the period in which the renewal options are exercised and could result in significant increases to revenue if the renewal options are not exercised at which time the related below market lease liabilities would be written off as an increase to revenue.\nTransaction costs related to the acquisition of a business, such as broker fees, transfer taxes, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses\u201d in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For asset acquisitions not meeting the definition of a business, transaction costs are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost.\nCapitalized Costs\nCertain external and internal costs directly related to the development and redevelopment of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, interest, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. We capitalize costs under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy. The determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord-owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements, but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction.\nWe capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of $8.4 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of $56.7 million and $95.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInterest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use as noted above. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period. We capitalized interest costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of $1.1 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSegment capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in maintenance capital expenditures in our retail portfolio was primarily related to the Safeway lease buildout at Waikele Center in the prior period. The decrease in maintenance capital expenditures in our office portfolio was primarily related to The Landmark at One Market and Torrey Reserve Campus building renovations in the prior period, partially offset by building renovations at Torrey Point, Solana Crossing and Lloyd District Portfolio during 2020.\nThe increase in new development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to costs incurred for the development of the La Jolla Commons development parcel.\nOur capital expenditures during 2021 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of our development, held for development and construction in progress properties. While the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, we expect expenditures incurred in 2021 will increase from 2020 in connection with our development activities at La Jolla Commons and renovations at One Beach Street, and completion of the Google LLC's tenant improvements at The Landmark at One Market.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt.\nAny interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. Our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not match, such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and LIBOR rate. In addition, we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. However, management does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. If a cash flow hedge is deemed\nineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review for impairment on a property by property basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written-down to fair value. The calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. Since our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. Actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. These estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.\nProperties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell. Although our strategy is to hold our properties over the long-term, if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to fair value and such loss could be material.\nNo impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gains, and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Provided we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, our taxable income generally would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders.\nWe, together with one of our subsidiaries, have elected to treat such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes.\nProperty Acquisitions and Dispositions\n2020 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring 2020, there were no acquisitions or dispositions.\n2019 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nOn June 20, 2019, we acquired La Jolla Commons, consisting of two office towers totaling approximately 724,000 square feet, an entitled development parcel and two parking structures, located in San Diego, California. The purchase price was approximately $525 million, less seller credits of (i) approximately $11.5 million for speculative lease-up, (ii) approximately $4.2 million for assumed contractual liabilities (iii) and approximately $1.7 million for closing prorations, excluding closing costs of approximately $0.2 million.\nThe property was acquired with proceeds from an underwritten public offering and borrowings under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility.\nOn May 22, 2019, we sold Solana Beach - Highway 101. The property is located in San Diego, California and was previously included in our retail segment. The sales price of this property of approximately $9.4 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately $9.4 million. Accordingly, we recorded a gain on sale of approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n2018 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring 2018, there were no acquisitions or dispositions.\nResults of Operations\nFor our discussion of results of operations, we have provided information on a total portfolio and same-store basis.\nFor our discussion related to the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2020.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, our operating portfolio was comprised of 28 office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties with an aggregate of approximately 6.6 million rentable square feet of office and retail space (including mixed-use retail space), 2,112 residential units (including 122 RV spaces) and a 369-room hotel. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and construction in progress. As of December 31, 2019, our operating portfolio was comprised of 28 office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties with an aggregate of approximately 6.6 million rentable square feet of office and retail space (including mixed-use retail space), 2,112 residential units (including 122 RV spaces) and a 369-room hotel. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and construction in progress.\nThe following table sets forth selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRevenue\nTotal property revenues. Total property revenue consists of rental revenue and other property income. Total property revenue decreased $22.2 million, or 6%, to $344.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $366.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The percentage leased was as follows for each segment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n(1)The percentage leased includes the square footage under lease, including leases which may not have commenced as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019, as applicable.\n(2) Includes the retail portion of the mixed-use property only.\nThe decrease in total property revenue was attributable primarily to the factors discussed below.\nRental revenues. Rental revenue includes minimum base rent, cost reimbursements, percentage rents and other rents. Rental revenue decreased $13.6 million, or 4%, to $330.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $343.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Rental revenue by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1)For this table and tables following, the same-store portfolio includes the 830 building at Lloyd District Portfolio which was placed into operations on August 1, 2019 after renovating the building. The same-store portfolio excludes: (i) Waikele Center due to significant redevelopment activity; (ii) La Jolla Commons as it was acquired on June 20, 2019; (iii) One Beach Street due to the renovation of the building; (iv) Waikiki Beach Walk Retail and Embassy SuitesTM Hotel due to significant spalling repair activity; and (v) land held for development.\nTotal office rental revenue increased $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental rental revenue of approximately $22.2 million during the period. The increase in total office rental revenue is partially offset by the decrease in rental revenue of approximately $2.9 million at One Beach Street due to the expiration of leases to allow for the modernization of the property. Same-store office rental revenue increased $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher annualized base rents at The Landmark at One Market, Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Point and Torrey Reserve Campus. The increase in same-store office rental revenue is partially offset by the decrease at First & Main primarily due to the increase in collectability related adjustments of straight-line rent receivables of approximately $0.8 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probably for certain tenants.\nTotal retail rental revenue decreased $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $2.8 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $5.9 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at Alamo Quarry Market, Carmel Mountain Plaza, Del Monte Center, Waikele Center and The Shops at Kalakaua as the temporary store closures or restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the financial condition of certain tenants to deteriorate. Additionally, the decrease in total retail rental revenue is also attributable to rent concessions of approximately $3.1 million and a decrease in cost reimbursements of approximately $4.0 million due to a real estate tax refund at Alamo Quarry Market and decrease in rental expenses for the retail segment. The decrease in total retail rental revenue was partially offset by higher annualized base rent at Waikele Center related to the Safeway lease and higher annualized base rent at Carmel Mountain Plaza related to the At Home Stores lease.\nMultifamily rental revenue decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in average occupancy to 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 92.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in occupancy primarily related to Hassalo on Eighth - Residential. The decrease in average occupancy is partially offset by the increase in average base rent per unit to $2,166 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,077 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nMixed-use rental revenue decreased $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy through hotel reservation cancellations and travel restrictions during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which led to a decrease in average occupancy and revenue per available room to 51.3% and $127 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 91.7% and $299 for year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce rental revenue at the hotel portion of the mixed-use property through the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public. The decrease in mixed-use rental revenue is also attributed to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $5.7 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $1.2 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at the retail portion of our mixed-use property.\nOther property income. Other property income decreased $8.6 million, or 38%, to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other property income by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nOffice other property income decreased $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental other property income of approximately $0.3 million during the period. Same-store office other property income decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in parking garage income at City Center Bellevue, Lloyd District Portfolio and First & Main during the period as the \"stay-at home\" order issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter caused a substantial portion of our tenants employees and their guests to continue to partially work from home during the period.\nRetail other property income decreased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to non-cash lease termination fees recognized in connection with the termination of a ground lease, and the ground lessee's surrender of, the former Sears building at Carmel Mountain Plaza during the prior period. The decrease in retail other property income was partially offset by an increase in lease termination fees received at Alamo Quarry Market, Del Monte Center, Carmel Country Plaza and Geary Marketplace during the period.\nMultifamily other property income decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in parking garage income at Hassalo on Eighth - Residential and late fees.\nMixed-use other property income decreased $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy beginning in March 2020 which led to a decrease in excise tax and food & beverage revenue at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and a decrease in parking garage income at the retail portion of our mixed-use property. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce mixed-use other property income through at least the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public.\nProperty Expenses\nTotal Property Expenses. Total property expenses consist of rental expenses and real estate taxes. Total property expenses decreased by $10.9 million, or 8%, to $121.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in total property expenses was attributable primarily to the factors discussed below.\nRental Expenses. Rental expenses decreased $12.8 million, or 14%, to $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $92.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Rental expense by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nTotal office rental expenses increased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had rental expenses of approximately $2.2 million during the period. The increase in total office rental expense was partially offset by the decrease in rental expenses of approximately $0.3 million at One Beach Street due to the expiration of leases to allow for the modernization of the property. Same-store office rental expenses decreased $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to utilities expense, janitorial services and supplies, and repairs and maintenance as the \"stay-at home\" order issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter caused a substantial portion of our tenants' employees to continue to work from home during the period. The decrease in same-store office rental expenses was partially offset by the increase in sublease expense related to the Annex Lease extension option exercised in March 2020, an increase in commercial rent tax at The Landmark at One Market, and an increase in insurance expense during the period.\nTotal retail rental expenses decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in utilities, day porter services, repairs and maintenance and trash services during the period as temporary store closures and restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused reduced demand for these rental expenses. The decrease in retail rental expense was partially offset by the increase in insurance expense during the period.\nMultifamily rental expensed increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to personnel compensation expenses, utilities, janitorial services and supplies, security services and insurance expense during the period.\nMixed-use rental expenses decreased $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in hotel room expenses, marketing expenses, and general excise tax expenses at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property during the period. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce rental expenses at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property through at least the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public. Additionally, the decrease in mixed-use rental expenses is also due to the decrease of personnel compensation, repairs and maintenance, and utilities expenses at the retail portion of our mixed-use property during the period.\nReal Estate Taxes. Real estate tax expense increased $1.9 million, or 5%, to $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Real estate tax expense by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nTotal office real estate taxes increased $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental real estate taxes of approximately $3.2 million. Same-store office real estate taxes increased $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in the assessed values of City Center Bellevue, The Landmark at One Market, Lloyd District Portfolio and Torrey Reserve Campus.\nRetail real estate taxes decreased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a net real estate tax refund of approximately $2.3 million at Alamo Quarry Market for the tax assessment for 2016 - 2018. The decrease in retail real estate taxes was partially offset by an increase in the assessed values of Waikele Center.\nMultifamily real estate taxes increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in assessed values at Pacific Ridge Apartments, Lomas Palisades and Hassalo on Eighth - Residential.\nMixed-use real estate taxes increased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in assessed values for the hotel portion of our mixed-use property.\nProperty Operating Income.\nProperty operating income decreased $11.3 million, or 5%, to $223.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $234.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Property operating income by segment was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nTotal office property operating income increased $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental property operating income of $17.0 million during the period. The increase in total office property operating income was partially offset by a decrease in property operating income of approximately $2.7 million at One Beach Street due to the expiration of leases to allow for the modernization of the property. Same-store property operating income increased $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher annualized base rents at The Landmark at One Market, Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Point and Torrey Reserve Campus.\nRetail property operating income decreased $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in collectability related adjustment of rent receivables of approximately $2.8 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $5.9 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at Alamo Quarry Market, Carmel Mountain Plaza, Del Monte Center, Waikele Center and The Shops at Kalakaua as the temporary store closures or restrictions on business operations from orders issued by state and local governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the financial condition of certain tenants to deteriorate. Additionally, the decrease in total retail property operating income was also due to the non-cash lease termination fees recognized in connection with the termination of a ground lease, and the ground lessee's surrender of, the former Sears building at Carmel Mountain Plaza during the prior period. Additionally, the decrease in total retail rental revenue is also attributable to rent concessions of approximately $3.1 million. The decrease in total retail property operating income was partially offset by the net property operating income related to the real estate tax refund at Alamo Quarry Market during the period and higher annualized base rent at Waikele Center related to the Safeway lease and higher annualized base rent at Carmel Mountain Plaza related to the At Home Stores lease.\nMultifamily property operating income decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the decrease in average occupancy to 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 92.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and increase in real estate tax assessments at Pacific Ridge, Lomas Palisades, and Hassalo on Eighth - Residential, and an increase in personnel compensation expenses, utilities, security services and insurance expense during the period.\nMixed-use property operating income decreased $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing tourism and hotel occupancy through hotel reservation cancellations and travel restrictions during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which led to a decrease in average occupancy and revenue per available room to 51.3% and $127 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 91.7% and $299 for year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tourism and hotel occupancy in Oahu due to COVID-19 is expected to substantially reduce property operating income at the hotel portion of the mixed-use property through the first half of 2021 or until the COVID-19 vaccine distribution is generally available to the public. The decrease in mixed-use property operating income is also attributed to the increase in collectability related adjustments of rent receivables of approximately $5.7 million and straight-line rent receivables of approximately $1.2 million as the collectability was determined to be no longer probable for certain tenants at the retail portion of our mixed-use property.\nOther\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $1.7 million, or 7%, to $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs, furlough expense for our hotel staff and legal costs.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12.1 million, or 13%, to $108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019, which had incremental depreciation and\namortization of $7.2 million during the period and higher depreciation and amortization at Lloyd District Portfolio, City Center Bellevue, Torrey Reserve Campus, Torrey Point, and Waikele Center due to tenant improvements that were put into service in 2019 and 2020.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.6 million, or 1%, to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the mortgages on Torrey Reserve - VCI, VCII, VCIII, Solana Crossing I-II, and Solana Beach Towne Centre on March 2, 2020 and a lower weighted average interest rate on our line of credit in 2020 partially offset by the closing of our Series G Notes on July 30, 2019.\nGain on sale of real estate. Gain on sale of real estate of $0.6 million during 2019 relates to our sale of Solana Beach - Highway 101 on May 22, 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other (expense) income, net increased $0.6 million, or 466%, to other income, net of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to other expense, net of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in income tax expense related to lower taxable income for our taxable REIT subsidiary partially offset by a decrease in interest and investment income attributed to lower weighted average interest rates on our money market balances.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\u201d section, the term the company\u201d refers only to American Assets Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, and excludes the Operating Partnership and all other subsidiaries.\nThe company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the company is the parent company and sole general partner, and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because the company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole.\nThe company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership. The company itself does not have any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the company owned an approximate 78.8% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 21.3% are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of the company's directors and executive officers. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies. The company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as the company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.\nThe liquidity of the company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the company. The primary cash requirement of the company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. The company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt, as discussed further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger the company's guarantee obligations, then the company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, the company's only significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.\nWe believe the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured line of credit, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the company and, in turn, for the company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, the company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the company, which would in turn, adversely affect the company's ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to the company's stockholders, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, general and administrative expenses, funding construction projects, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.\nThe company may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem the Operating Partnership's outstanding debt, the company's shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nFor the company to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. While historically the company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited\ncircumstances, the company's own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. The company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership's working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.\nThe company is a well-known seasoned issuer. As circumstances warrant, the company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. When the company receives proceeds from preferred or common equity issuances, it is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for preferred or common partnership units of the operating partnership. The operating partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, to develop new or existing properties, to acquire properties or for general corporate purposes.\nIn January 2021, the company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC, which became effective upon filing and which replaced the prior Form S-3ASR that was filed with the SEC in February 2018. The universal shelf registration statement may permit the company from time to time to offer and sell equity securities of the company. However, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete any such offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets, among others.\nOn May 27, 2015, the company entered into a new at-the-market, or ATM, equity program with five sales agents under which the company may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million (the \"2015 ATM Program\"). The sales of shares of the company's common stock made through the 2015 ATM Program were made in at-the-market\u201d offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2020, the company has issued 6,930,002 shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $38.58 for gross cash proceeds of $267.4 million under the ATM equity program, in the aggregate.\nThe company intends to use the net proceeds to fund development or redevelopment activities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our amended and restated credit facility or other debt financing obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities and/or for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the company had the capacity to issue up to an additional $132.6 million in shares of common stock under the 2015 ATM Program. Actual future sales will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the company's common stock and the company's capital needs. The company has no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the 2015 ATM Program.\nOn June 14, 2019, we issued and sold 10,925,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $44.75 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $472.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\nIn this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P.\u201d section, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Operating Partnership and American Assets Trust, Inc. together with their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. American Assets Trust, Inc. is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. Because we operate on a consolidated basis with American Assets Trust, Inc., the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc.\u201d should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis.\nDue to the nature of our business, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is used for the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service and dividends to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders and our unitholders. As a REIT, American Assets Trust, Inc. must generally make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of its net taxable income.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, regular debt service requirements, dividend payments to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders required to maintain its REIT status, distributions to our other unitholders, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, borrowings available under our second amended and restated credit facility.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions, tenant improvements and capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements to pay scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and capital improvements with net cash from operations, long-term\nsecured and unsecured indebtedness and, if necessary, the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and capital improvements using our second amended and restated credit facility pending permanent financing. We believe that we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt, noting that during the third quarter of 2015, the company obtained investment grade credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service (Baa3), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (BBB), and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot be assured that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company. Given our past ability to access the capital markets, we expect debt or equity to be available to us. Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of future development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy.\nOur overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of developments. Our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and/or our second amended and restated credit facility.\nWe intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment grade debt ratings. In the short and long term, we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity, unsecured and/or secured debt financings, and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure.\nWe currently believe that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our ATM equity program, our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table outlines the timing of required payments related to our commitments as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1) The unsecured revolving line of credit has a capacity of $350 million plus an accordion feature that may allow us to increase the availability thereunder up to an additional $250 million, subject to meeting specified requirements and obtaining additional commitments from lenders. The unsecured revolving line of credit initially matures on January 9, 2022 and we have two six-month options to extend its maturity to January, 9, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash Flows\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $139.0 million and $109.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $26.8 million to $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $153.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to the decrease in rental revenue from the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and a decrease in rent collections from our retail portfolio.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $530.1 million to $69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $599.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of La Jolla Commons on June 20, 2019 in the prior period.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $497.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the underwritten public offering that settled on June 14, 2019.\nNet Operating Income\nNet Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance). NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expense, other non-property income and losses, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nNOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds of the property owner, (2) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, or (3) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our retail, office, multifamily or mixed-use properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is intended to be captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 computed in accordance with GAAP (in thousands):\n\nFunds from Operations\nWe present FFO because we consider FFO an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nFFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent (in thousands, except per share and share data):\n\n(1)For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the weighted average common shares used to compute FFO per diluted share include unvested restricted stock awards that are subject to time vesting, as the vesting of the restricted stock awards is dilutive in the computation of FFO per diluted\nshares, but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted EPS for the periods. Diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable.\nInflation\nSubstantially all of our office and retail leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above. In addition, our multifamily leases (other than at our RV resort where spaces can be rented at a daily, weekly or monthly rate) generally have lease terms ranging from seven to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms, and generally allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal, which we believe reduces our exposure to the effects of inflation. For the hotel portion of our mixed-use property, we possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise room rates.", "item_7_tables": "Table 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- American Assets Trust is a full service, vertically integrated REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties primarily in major West Coast markets.\n\n2020 Performance Highlights\n- Total revenues decreased 6% to $344.6 million due to declines in retail and mixed-use revenue related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 39% to $27.7 million.\n- FFO per diluted share decreased 14% to $1.89. \n\nCOVID-19 Impact\n- COVID-19 and related government restrictions severely impacted the retail and mixed-use properties, leading many retail tenants to request rent deferrals and abatements. Hotel occupancy and revenue plunged at the mixed-use property.\n- As of December 31, 2020, the company has entered into $13.4 million of rent deferrals/concessions, about 4% of total 2020 contracted rent.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- The company believes it has adequate liquidity and access to capital markets to fund near-term obligations. \n- Cash flow from operations remains strong but was impacted by decreased rent collections in retail/mixed-use.\n- The company may issue equity opportunistically depending on market conditions to fund acquisitions and develop projects.\n\nThat summarizes some of the key highlights from the MD&A report.
