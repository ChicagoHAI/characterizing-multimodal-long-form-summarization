Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users. Our principal nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). Our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers, and compound fertilizer products (NPKs), which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. We operate world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, and distribute plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States. We also export nitrogen fertilizer products from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Yazoo City, Mississippi manufacturing facilities, and our United Kingdom manufacturing facilities in Billingham and Ince.\nOur principal assets include:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>four U.S. nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in the world); Port Neal, Iowa; Yazoo City, Mississippi; and Woodward, Oklahoma.

(TNGP), the sole general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement. The purchase price of $84.033 per unit was determined under the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement as the average of the daily closing prices per common unit for the 20 consecutive trading days beginning with January 5, 2018 and ending with February 2, 2018. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. We intend to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018 purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP, and the common units representing limited partner interests will cease to be publicly traded or listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nIndustry Factors\nWe operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below.\nGlobal Supply and Demand Factors\nOur products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand and different cost factors.\nHistorically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, gross domestic product growth, changes in dietary habits, planted acreage, and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short-term fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, governmental regulations, including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of bio-fuels or industrial nitrogen products and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key exporting/consuming countries such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, among others, often play a major role in shaping near-term market fundamentals. The economics of nitrogen-based fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade. Raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal; supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities.\nOver the last decade, strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities, which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity. As a result, global nitrogen fertilizer capacity increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating a surplus of global nitrogen capacity in the market, and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. In addition, global feedstock commodity prices declined, including coal and oil-linked gas, contributing to the lower nitrogen fertilizer prices.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nGlobal Trade in Fertilizer\nIn addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values, the availability of credit and governmental trade policies. The development of additional natural gas reserves in North America over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world, making North American nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive. These lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in North America, including our capacity expansion projects in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa, which were completed in December 2016. Changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world.\nImports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers located in the Middle East, Ukraine, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, North Africa, Russia and China have been major exporters to North America.\nFarmers' Economics\nThe demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns, crop prices and the types of crops planted.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Results\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\" or \"Tax Reform\") which includes a number of changes to U.S. tax law that affect us. As a result of the Tax Act we recognized a $491 million income tax benefit, which has a significant impact on our 2017 financial results. This impact generally results from the following two major provisions:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impact of Tax Rate Change on Deferred Tax Liabilities - The most significant impact of Tax Reform is the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This change necessitates the revaluation of all of our U.S. deferred tax balances which resulted in an income tax benefit of $552 million that was recorded in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Transition Tax (Repatriation Tax) on Foreign Earnings and Profits - Tax Reform requires us to pay U.S. tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. Foreign earnings held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at a 15.5% rate, and the remaining earnings are taxed at an 8% rate. We intend to elect to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period and have recognized a tax charge and liability of $57 million in 2017 for this item.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Nitrogen Fertilizer Selling Prices\nA significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016 and 2017, including an increase in production capacity located in North America, which has further increased supply. Additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2018. As a result, we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.\nThe U.S. Gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there. Through most of 2016, nitrogen pricing at the U.S. Gulf declined, often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to continued imports from various exporting regions and delayed North American buyer interest as a result of greater global nitrogen supply availability. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multi-year lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of 2016. Early in the first quarter of 2017, prices began to increase as the supply and demand balance tightened in anticipation of spring fertilizer demand for the planting and growing season. However, as the first quarter progressed, increased imports into North America increased fertilizer supply in the region, which pressured selling prices downward as the quarter ended. During the second quarter of 2017, excess supply through imports into the United States that occurred in the first quarter of 2017 continued in the second quarter, negatively impacting selling prices. During the third quarter of 2017, prices hit yearly lows and then selling prices for most nitrogen products increased throughout the quarter, ending higher than at the beginning of the quarter, driven by significantly lower Chinese exports, higher energy and production costs in parts of the world, a weaker U.S. dollar and strong global demand. During the fourth quarter of 2017, certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur, were delayed, and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing.\nThe significant price fluctuations we have experienced in 2017 are symptoms of a market in transition as new capacity comes on line and global trade flows adjust, and this transition is not complete. We expect the final set of North American capacity additions to come fully on line by mid-2018. Should imports of nitrogen products into North America continue at high rates, the oversupply in the region will continue, which could lead to lower prices, similar to those experienced in early 2017. New global nitrogen capacity additions coming on line after 2018 are expected to be lower than recent years, which will support the market transition or more balanced supply and demand.\nThe greater global nitrogen supply availability and resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices significantly impacted our results. The average selling price for our products for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $207 per ton, $217 per ton and $314 per ton, respectively. The decline in average selling prices from 2016 to 2017 reduced net sales by $293 million, while the decline in average selling prices from 2015 to 2016 reduced net sales by $1.4 billion. In addition to the direct impact of lower selling prices, during periods of declining prices, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, certain significant items impacted our financial results.

This increase in depreciation expense reflects the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing in service all five of the new plants prior to the end of 2016. The capacity expansion projects were originally announced in 2012 and included the construction of new ammonia, urea, and UAN plants at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal, Iowa complex. These plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25%, improved our product mix flexibility at Donaldsonville, and improved our ability to serve upper-Midwest urea customers from our Port Neal location. The following table indicates the quarter in which each of the five expansion plants were placed in service.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter placed in service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expansion plant location\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Donaldsonville Urea\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q1 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Donaldsonville UAN\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Donaldsonville Ammonia\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Port Neal Ammonia and Urea\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation expense pertaining to each of our capacity expansion plants commenced once the applicable plant was placed in service.\nUnrealized net mark-to-market loss (gain) on natural gas derivatives\nNatural gas is typically the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. This can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market losses (gains) on natural gas derivatives of $61 million, $(260) million and $176 million, respectively.\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans\nIn 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized losses (gains) of $2 million, $93 million and $(8) million, respectively, from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily British pound and Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested.\nEquity method investment tax contingency accrual\nThe Trinidad tax authority (the Board of Inland Revenue) has issued a tax assessment against our equity method investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, PLNL, related to a dispute over whether tax depreciation must be claimed during a tax holiday period that was granted to PLNL under the Trinidad Fiscal Incentives Act. The tax holiday was granted as an incentive to construct PLNL's ammonia plant. Based on the facts and circumstances of this matter, PLNL recorded a tax contingency accrual, which reduced our equity in earnings of PLNL for 2017 by approximately $7 million reflecting our 50% ownership interest. In early 2018, PLNL settled this matter with the Board of Inland Revenue for the amounts accrued.\nStrategic venture with CHS\nWe commenced a strategic venture with CHS on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for $2.8 billion. CHS also began receiving deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to approximately 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its minority equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. The amounts of distributions from CFN to us and CHS are based generally on the profitability of CFN and determined based on the volume of granular urea and UAN sold by CFN to us and CHS pursuant to supply agreements, less a formula driven amount based primarily on the cost of natural gas used to produce the granular urea and UAN, and adjusted for the allocation of items such as operational efficiencies and overhead amounts.\nWe began recognizing the noncontrolling interest pertaining to CHS' ownership interest in CFN on February 1, 2016. During 2017 and 2016, we recognized earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN of $73 million and\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n$93 million, respectively. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information regarding our strategic venture with CHS.\nUnder the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of $5 million to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026. This obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative. During 2017 and 2016, included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations is a net loss of $4 million and $23 million, respectively.\nDebt activity\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) pursuant to a tender offer. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we took certain steps with respect to the Revolving Credit Agreement and our senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes). On November 21, 2016, we prepaid the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Private Senior Notes, and paid the related make-whole amount of approximately $170 million. We made the prepayment and make-whole payment using the proceeds from an offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2021 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2026 (collectively referred to as the Senior Secured Notes\u201d). We recognized $167 million of the $170 million cash make-whole payment on the Private Senior Notes as a loss on debt extinguishment, with the $3 million remainder being a debt modification cost that is being amortized over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nIn connection with the completion of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes in November 2016, certain amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement became effective. The amendments included, among other things, changes in and additions to the financial and other covenants and a reduction in the size of the facility from $1.5 billion to $750 million.\nIn conjunction with our debt restructuring, including amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement, we recognized $18 million of debt issuance and amendment fees in 2016. See further discussion under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 11-Financing Agreements for additional information.\nCapacity expansion projects\nOur capacity expansion projects were completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Capacity expansion project expenses in 2016 and 2015 of $73 million and $51 million, respectively, are included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations and generally consisted of administrative costs and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization.\nStart-up costs of $52 million, which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the ammonia plants, were incurred in 2016 and are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Losses on foreign currency derivatives of $22 million in 2015 are included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations and relate to hedges of European euro denominated equipment purchased as part of the capacity expansion projects.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nTransaction costs and termination of agreement with OCI\nOn August 6, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the Combination Agreement) to combine with the European, North American and global distribution businesses of OCI N.V. (OCI). On May 22, 2016, CF Holdings, OCI and the other parties to the Combination Agreement entered into a termination agreement (the Termination Agreement) under which the parties agreed to terminate the Combination Agreement by mutual written consent. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, CF Holdings paid OCI a termination fee of $150 million. Under the Termination Agreement, the parties to the Combination Agreement also agreed to release each other from any and all claims, actions, obligations, liabilities, expenses and fees in connection with, arising out of or related to the Combination Agreement and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby (other than the confidentiality agreement between CF Holdings and OCI) or the transactions contemplated therein or thereby.\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI and our strategic venture with CHS. This includes the $150 million termination fee paid to OCI in the second quarter of 2016, which is described above, and costs for various consulting and legal services. In 2015, we incurred $57 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, our strategic venture with CHS, and the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nOn September 18, 2015, in connection with our proposed combination with OCI, we entered into a senior unsecured 364-day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders' commitment under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically and we recognized $28 million in bridge loan commitment fees. In 2015, we recognized $6 million of fees related to the initiation of the bridge loan.\nCF Fertilisers UK acquisition\nOn July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us for total consideration of $570 million, and CF Fertilisers UK became a wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the acquisition, we recognized a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity investment in CF Fertilisers UK. CF Fertilisers UK Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Limited), a wholly owned subsidiary of CF Fertilisers UK, operates two nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United Kingdom, in the cities of Ince and Billingham. This transaction increased our manufacturing capacity with the acquisition of CF Fertilisers UK's nitrogen manufacturing complexes. The Ince complex is located in northwestern England and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, an AN plant and three NPK plants. The Billingham complex is located in the Teesside chemical area in northeastern England, and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, a carbon dioxide plant and an AN fertilizer plant.\nEquity method investments\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a gain of $14 million related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility. During 2015, we recognized a loss of $43 million related to the sale of our 50% investment in Keytrade AG and the sale of our 50% investment in an ammonia storage joint venture in Houston, Texas.\nOur equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, includes an impairment charge of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million and $62 million, respectively. PLNL is our joint venture investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) pursuant to a gas sales contract (the NGC Contract). PLNL had experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below, for additional information.\nSee Note 7-Equity Method Investments for additional information regarding our equity method investments.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nFinancial Executive Summary\nNet earnings (loss)\nWe reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $358 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $277 million in 2016, or an increase in net earnings between the periods of $635 million. Tax Reform had a significant impact on our reported results in 2017 as we recognized $491 million of income in our tax provision related to the enactment of Tax Reform in the United States. Further information regarding the impact of Tax Reform can be found above under \"Items Affecting Comparability of Results-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\" Diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders was $1.53 in 2017 compared to diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $1.19 in 2016, or an increase of $2.72 per share. The impact of Tax Reform added $2.10 to diluted earnings per share in 2017.\n(Loss) earnings before income taxes\nEarnings before income taxes increased by $101 million to a loss of $125 million in 2017 from a loss of $226 million in 2016. The increase in earnings before income taxes is due to a combination of the following three categories of items which are described below:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$617 million of charges that were recognized in 2016 that did not reoccur in 2017; partially offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$410 million reduction in gross margin from operations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$108 million increase in net interest expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Significant charges in 2016\nIn 2016, we recognized $617 million of certain significant charges from the following items:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Transaction costs of $179 million pertaining to our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI (that was ultimately terminated in 2016) and costs associated with establishing our strategic venture with CHS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An impairment charge of $134 million related to our investment in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We took actions in both 2016 and 2017 to make modifications to our outstanding debt in response to changes in market conditions.

Industry pricing conditions in 2017 declined early in the year to multi-year lows as oversupply conditions persisted, but selling prices rose as the year ended when supply and demand conditions were more in balance due to delays in the start-up of certain new industry capacity and stronger demand in certain regions. Our results in 2017 also included the full impact of all of our new capacity expansion plants. As a result, we set both production and sales volume records in 2017.\nOur gross margin declined by $410 million in 2017 to $430 million from $840 million in 2016. The following major factors contributed to the decline in gross margin:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a higher unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives, which decreased gross margin by $321 million as 2017 included a $61 million loss and 2016 included a $260 million gain,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in average selling prices of 5%, which reduced gross margin by $293 million, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

The increase is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects in 2016.\nCash Position\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $835 million at December 31, 2017, a decline of $329 million from $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016.

The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.\nOur total net sales increased $445 million, or 12%, to $4.13 billion in 2017 compared to $3.69 billion in 2016 due to an 18% increase in sales volume, which increased net sales by $738 million, partially offset by a 5% decrease in average selling prices, which reduced net sales by $293 million.\nAverage selling prices were $207 per ton in 2017 compared to $217 per ton in 2016 due primarily to lower ammonia, UAN and granular urea average selling prices in 2017. Selling prices were negatively impacted by greater supply availability which continues to pressure selling prices globally. During the fourth quarter of 2017, certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur, were delayed, and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing.\nThe increase in total sales volume of 18% was due primarily to higher ammonia and granular urea sales volumes, driven by increased production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in December 2016.\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, purchased product costs, and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments, maintenance, direct labor, depreciation and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers.\nOur cost of sales increased $855 million, or 30%, from 2016 to 2017. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, higher unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives and higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, in addition to higher depreciation expense related to the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service. These increases to cost of sales were partially offset by targeted cost reduction initiatives, production efficiencies due to increased volume in 2017 and the absence of start-up costs of the new ammonia plant at our Donaldsonville facility and the new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal facility that occurred in 2016. The cost of sales per ton averaged $185 in 2017, a 10% increase from $168 per ton in 2016. Cost of sales includes a $61 million unrealized net mark-to-market loss in 2017 compared to a $260 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain in 2016. Additionally, realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, increased 11% from $3.07 per MMBtu in 2016 to $3.40 in 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payroll-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees, including those for corporate initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $18 million to $192 million in 2017 from $174 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to the combination of certain corporate office initiatives and higher incentive compensation due to improvements in operating performance.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs consist of various consulting and legal services associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI that was terminated on May 22, 2016; our strategic venture with CHS, which began on February 1, 2016; and our July 31, 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs, including the $150 million termination fee paid to OCI in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the Combination Agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOther Operating-Net\nOther operating-net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations and costs associated with our capacity expansion projects. Costs included in \"other costs\" can include foreign exchange gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives, costs associated with our closed facilities, amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.\nOther operating-net was $18 million of expense in 2017 compared to $208 million of expense in 2016. The decreased expense was due primarily to a $93 million loss in 2016 from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily British pound and Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested. Due to a restructuring of certain intercompany loans, we did not incur the same level of foreign exchange rate impacts in 2017. The decreased expense is also due to expansion project expenses in 2016 of $73 million, generally consisting of administrative and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization, and a $23 million charge representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 8-Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Operating Affiliates\nEquity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates primarily consists of our 50% ownership interest in PLNL. We include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in PLNL as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities. Our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition. In 2016, equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates also includes impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates was $9 million of earnings in 2017 compared to $145 million of losses in 2016. Earnings in 2017 includes a gain of $14 million related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a $134 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL. For additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL, see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,\" below, and Note 7-Equity Method Investments.\nInterest Expense-Net\nOur interest expense-net includes the interest expense on our long-term debt, amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees pursuant to our Revolving Credit Agreement. Capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs. Our interest expense-net also includes interest income, which represents amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nNet interest expense increased by $108 million to $303 million in 2017 from $195 million in 2015. The $108 million increase was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects. In 2016, capitalized interest was $166 million compared to $2 million in 2017. Net interest expense in 2016 also includes the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of $28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Upon the termination of the proposed combination with OCI, the unamortized portion of these fees was expensed.\nDuring 2016, due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we modified the Revolving Credit Agreement by reducing its size from $2.0 billion to $750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms. As a result of these changes, we recognized $16 million of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense in 2016.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLoss on debt extinguishment of $53 million in 2017 primarily consists of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. Loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million in 2016 consists of the make-whole payment, which resulted from our November 21, 2016 prepayment of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million excludes $3 million (of the $170 million make-whole payment), which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Provision\nOur income tax benefit for 2017 was $575 million on a pre-tax loss of $125 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $68 million on a pre-tax loss of $226 million in the prior year. The higher income tax benefit in 2017 is due primarily to the impact of the Tax Act, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $491 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe primary impact of the Tax Act is the revaluation of all of our U.S. deferred tax balances, as result of the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $552 million that was recorded in 2017. This income tax benefit was partially offset by a tax charge and liability of $57 million, which represents our best estimate of the transition tax, or repatriation tax, on foreign earnings and profits, as described above under \"Items Affecting Comparability-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\"\nIn addition, in both years, our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP, as our consolidated income tax (benefit) provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $92 million and $119 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are included in our pre-tax loss, impact the effective tax rate in both years. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nDue primarily to the $491 million income tax benefit from the Tax Act, we recognized a $575 million income tax benefit in 2017 on a pre-tax loss of $125 million. Our effective tax rate in 2017, exclusive of the tax benefit from the Tax Act and exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $92 million from our pre-tax loss, results in an effective tax rate of 38.8%. Our effective tax rate in 2016, exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $119 million from our pre-tax income, resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.6%.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million, which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our 2016 income tax provision does not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction, which reduced our 2016 effective tax rate.\nBoth 2017 and 2016 were impacted by additional discrete tax items. See Note 9-Income Taxes for additional information.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the net earnings attributable to the 24.7% interest of the publicly-held common units of TNCLP. We own approximately 75.3% of TNCLP and outside investors own the remaining 24.7%. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11% CHS minority equity interest in CFN, a subsidiary of CF Holdings, purchased for $2.8 billion on February 1, 2016.\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $27 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to lower earnings from both CFN and TNCLP as both were impacted by lower average selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. The earnings of CFN were also impacted by higher natural gas prices and the impact of higher depreciation as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service.\nDiluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nDiluted net earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders, including the impact of Tax Reform, increased $2.72 to earnings of $1.53 per share in 2017 from a loss of $1.19 per share in 2016. This increase is due primarily to the impact of Tax Reform partially offset by lower gross margin primarily driven by an increase in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, the impact of lower selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability, higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, and higher depreciation expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales\nOur total net sales decreased $623 million, or 14%, to $3.69 billion in 2016 compared to $4.31 billion in 2015. The impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition increased our net sales by $269 million, or 6%. The remaining decline in our net sales of $892 million, or 21%, was due to a 31% decline in average selling prices partially offset by a 14% increase in sales volume.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nAverage selling prices, excluding the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition impact, were $218 per ton in 2016 compared to $318 per ton in 2015 due primarily to lower selling prices across all products. Selling prices were negatively impacted by excess global nitrogen supply. Pricing for nitrogen fertilizer products in the U.S. Gulf declined during most of 2016, often trading below parity with other international pricing points, as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multi-year lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of the year.\nOur total sales volume increased by 24% from 2015 to 2016. The impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition increased our sales volume by 10%. The remaining increase in our sales volume of 14% was due primarily to greater granular urea and UAN volume available for sale due to our completed capacity expansion projects, partly offset by lower ammonia sales volume due to lower demand in North America during the fall application season. In addition, our ammonia sales volumes were lower in 2016 as we upgraded existing ammonia production as a result of our granular urea and UAN capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales increased $84 million, or 3%, from 2015 to 2016. The overall increase in cost of sales is due primarily to the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased cost of sales by $251 million, or 9%, as 2016 includes a full year of CF Fertilisers UK results and 2015 includes five months of CF Fertilisers UK results. The remaining decrease in our cost of sales of $167 million, or 6%, was due primarily to the combination of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives and lower realized natural gas costs, partly offset by higher capacity expansion project related costs. Cost of sales includes a $260 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain in 2016 as compared to a $176 million unrealized net mark-to-market loss in 2015. Realized natural gas costs, including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivatives, declined 6% from $3.28 per MMBtu in 2015 to $3.07 per MMBtu in 2016 as natural gas prices were lower in 2016, particularly in the first half of the year with high storage levels and strong production in North America, although natural gas prices increased towards the end of 2016.\nCapacity expansion project costs, including depreciation expense, which commenced once the respective expansion plant was placed in service, totaled $116 million in 2016. Start-up costs, which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the new ammonia plants for our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa plants, totaled $52 million in 2016.\nCost of goods sold per ton declined $33 per ton, or 16%, from $201 in 2015 to $168 in 2016, as a result of the factors noted above.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $4 million to $174 million in 2016 from $170 million in 2015. The increase was due primarily to the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, partly offset by lower costs for corporate office initiatives and lower intangible asset amortization expense.\nTransaction Costs\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI and our strategic venture with CHS. This includes the $150 million termination fee paid by CF Holdings to OCI in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the Combination Agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services. In 2015, we incurred $57 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, our strategic venture with CHS and the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nOther Operating-Net\nOther operating-net was $208 million in 2016 compared to $92 million in 2015. The increased expense was due primarily to $93 million of realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions primarily related to British pound denominated intercompany debt that has not been permanently invested. In addition, the increased expense also reflects higher expansion project costs pertaining to our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization and the loss of $23 million representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 8-Fair Value Measurements for additional information. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives of $22 million.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nEquity in (Losses) Earnings of Operating Affiliates\nEquity in (losses) earnings of operating affiliates decreased by $110 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to a $134 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $62 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL. The remaining decrease was due primarily to lower operating results from PLNL, which included costs of $21 million that were incurred during 2016 related to a planned maintenance activity at the PLNL ammonia plant that resulted in the shutdown of the plant for approximately 45 days and the impact of lower ammonia selling prices in 2016 compared to 2015. For additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL, see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,\" below, and Note 7-Equity Method Investments.\nInterest Expense-Net\nNet interest expense increased by $64 million to $195 million in 2016 from $131 million in 2015. The $64 million increase in net interest expense was due primarily to the combination of higher debt levels due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of Private Senior Notes in September 2015 and debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to the restructuring of our debt and the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2016. Due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we modified the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2016 by reducing its size from $2.0 billion to $750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms. As a result of these changes, we recognized $16 million of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense. The increase in interest expense-net in 2016 also includes the amortization of capitalized Bridge Credit Agreement fees of $28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain of the OCI businesses. We also recorded capitalized interest of $166 million in 2016 related primarily to our capacity expansion projects compared to $154 million in 2015.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLoss on debt extinguishment of $167 million in 2016 consists of the make-whole payment, which resulted from our November 21, 2016 prepayment of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. This amount excludes $3 million (of the $170 million make-whole payment), which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Provision\nOur income tax benefit for 2016 was $68 million on a pre-tax loss of $226 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.0%, compared to an income tax provision of $396 million on pre-tax income of $1.06 billion, or an effective tax rate of 37.4%, in the prior year.\nState income taxes for 2016 were favorably impacted by investment tax credits of $13 million related to capital assets placed in service at our production facilities in Oklahoma that are indefinitely available to offset income taxes in that jurisdiction in future years. Our effective state income tax rate was also reduced as a result of the changes to our legal entity structure effected in the first quarter of 2016 as part of our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nState income taxes for 2016 includes a tax benefit of $46 million, net of federal tax effect, for state net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe income tax provision for 2016 includes the tax impact of the recaptured U.S. manufacturing profits deductions claimed in prior years that will not be deductible as a result of our intention to carryback the tax net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 to those prior tax years.\nNon-deductible capital costs for the tax year ended December 31, 2016 include certain transaction costs capitalized in the prior year that are now deductible as a result of the termination of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI.\nForeign subsidiaries of the Company have incurred capital losses of $109 million that are indefinitely available to offset capital gains in those foreign jurisdictions. As the future realization of these carryforwards is not anticipated, a valuation allowance of $28 million was recorded in 2016.\nIn the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million and $62 million,\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nrespectively, which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our respective income tax provisions do not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us and recognized a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK. The earnings in CF Fertilisers UK have been permanently reinvested. Therefore, the recognition of the $94 million million gain on the remeasurement of the historical equity investment does not include the recognition of tax expense on the gain.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP, as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $119 million and $34 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are included in (loss) earnings before income taxes and equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates, impact the effective tax rate in both years. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2016 due to our strategic venture with CHS that commenced on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nSee Note 9-Income Taxes for additional information.\nEquity in Earnings of Non-Operating Affiliates-Net of Taxes\nEquity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities that we account for using the equity method and exclude from operating earnings. Equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes in 2015 included the previously owned 50% equity method earnings of CF Fertilisers UK and also included our share of operating losses experienced at Keytrade. On July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us for total consideration of $570 million, and CF Fertilisers UK became wholly owned by us and part of our consolidated financial results. We recorded a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK in connection with the closing of the acquisition. Equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes on 2015 also included our share of CF Fertilisers UK operating results up to the date of the acquisition. In addition, during the second quarter of 2015, we sold our interests in Keytrade and recorded an after-tax loss of $29 million (pre-tax loss of $40 million).\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $85 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN. This increase is partly offset by lower net earnings attributable to the approximately 24.7% interest of the publicly held common units of TNCLP.\nDiluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nDiluted net (loss) earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased $4.15 to a loss of $1.19 per share in 2016 from diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.96 per share in 2015. This decrease is due to lower net earnings.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nOur reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker, as defined in the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), assesses the performance of our reportable segments and makes decisions about resource allocation. These segments are differentiated by products. Our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Total other operating costs and expenses (consisting of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating-net) and non-operating expenses (interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management.\nThe following table presents summary operating results by business segment:\nTable 159:

Net sales in the ammonia segment increased by $228 million, or 23%, to $1.21 billion in 2017 from $981 million in 2016 due primarily to a 43% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 13% decrease in average selling prices. The increase in sales volume was due to higher production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in December 2016. Average selling prices declined due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. Selling prices strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2017 rising approximately 3% compared to the prior year period.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment averaged $261 per ton in 2017, a 5% increase from $248 per ton in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, in addition to higher depreciation as a result of the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities, partially offset by the start-up costs for those plants in 2016 and production efficiencies realized in 2017 due to increased volume. Depreciation and amortization in our ammonia segment in 2017 was $45 per ton compared to $33 per ton in 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales in the ammonia segment decreased by $542 million, or 36%, to $981 million in 2016 from $1.52 billion in 2015 due primarily to a 33% decrease in average selling prices and a 4% decrease in sales volume. These results include the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased net sales by $26 million, or 2%. The remaining decrease in our ammonia net sales of $568 million, or 37%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices and sales volume. Selling prices declined due to excess global nitrogen supply. In addition, our selling prices reflect the impact of a higher proportion of export sales, the volumes of which increased as a result of the weak fall application season attributable to the combined impact of weather conditions and low crop prices on our customers' decisions related to applying fertilizer in the fall. Sales volume in 2016 declined due to the combination of the weak fall application season and the impact of upgrading additional ammonia production at our Donaldsonville facility into granular urea and UAN as a result of our capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment averaged $248 per ton in 2016, including the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which averaged $220 per ton. The remaining cost of sales per ton was $250 in 2016, a 16% decrease from the $296 per ton in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015 and to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs in 2016. This was partly offset by capacity expansion project start-up costs of $50 million and an increase in expansion project depreciation as a result of the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities.\nGranular Urea Segment\nOur granular urea segment produces granular urea, which contains 46% nitrogen. Produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide, it has the highest nitrogen content of any of our solid nitrogen fertilizers. Granular urea is produced at our Courtright, Ontario; Donaldsonville, Louisiana; Medicine Hat, Alberta; and Port Neal, Iowa nitrogen complexes.\nThe following table presents summary operating data for

Net sales in the granular urea segment increased by $140 million, or 17%, to $971 million in 2017 compared to $831 million in 2016 due primarily to a 21% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 3% decrease in average selling prices. Sales volume was higher due primarily to increased production at our new Port Neal facility, which came on line in the fourth quarter of 2016. Average selling prices decreased to $223 per ton in 2017 compared to $231 per ton in 2016 due primarily to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. Selling prices strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2017 rising approximately 14% compared to the prior year period.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our granular urea segment averaged $197 in 2017, a 22% increase from the $162 per ton in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher depreciation as a result of the new granular urea plant at our Port Neal facility, an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in 2017 compared to a gain in the comparable period of 2016 and higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives. These increases in cost of sales were partially offset by the impact of production efficiencies due to increased volume. Depreciation and amortization in our granular urea segment in 2017 was $56 per ton compared to $31 per ton in 2016.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales in the granular urea segment increased by $43 million, or 5%, to $831 million in 2016 compared to $788 million in 2015 due primarily to a 46% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 28% decrease in average selling prices. Sales volume was higher due to increased production available as a result of our expanded urea capacity at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex that came on line in November of 2015. Average selling prices decreased to $231 per ton in 2016 compared to $320 per ton in 2015 due primarily to excess global nitrogen supply weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our granular urea segment averaged $162 in 2016, a 15% decrease from the $191 per ton in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015. This was partly offset by increased depreciation expense related to our expanded urea production at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex and $2 million of start-up costs at our Port Neal, Iowa complex that came on line in December 2016.\nUAN Segment\nOur UAN segment produces urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN).

INC.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales. Total net sales in our Other segment increased $53 million, or 20%, to $319 million in 2017 from $266 million in 2016 due to a 24% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 3% decrease in average selling prices. The increase in our Other segment sales volume was due to an increase in DEF sales volume as demand in North America continued to grow. The decline in average selling prices is due to greater global nitrogen supply availability weighing on global nitrogen selling prices and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes between the U.S. dollar and the British pound, which reduced net sales by $6 million.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our Other segment averaged $133 in 2017, a 2% increase from $131 per ton in 2016, due primarily to the impact of an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in 2017 compared to a gain in the comparable period of 2016, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate changes between the U.S. dollar and the British pound and the impact of production efficiencies due to increased volume.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Total net sales in our Other segment increased $43 million, or 19%, to $266 million in 2016 from $223 million in 2015 due to a 49% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 20% decrease in average selling prices. These results include the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased net sales by $79 million, or 35%. The remaining decrease in our Other segment net sales of $36 million, or 16%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices due to excess global nitrogen supply weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our Other segment averaged $131 in 2016, including the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which averaged $158 per ton. The remaining cost of sales per ton averaged $121 in 2016, an 18% decrease from the $147 per ton in 2015 due to the unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 and the impact of the purchase accounting inventory valuation step-up in 2015 arising out of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, investments, taxes, share repurchases and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business. Generally, our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes cash generated by customer advances. We may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our credit agreements.\nAt December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under the Revolving Credit Agreement and our senior notes.\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $835 million at December 31, 2017, a decline of $329 million from $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016. During 2017, our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events, which are further described below.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Receipt of a federal tax refund of $815 million due to the carryback of certain tax losses primarily arising from our capacity expansion projects\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Early redemption and purchase of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes due in 2018 and 2020\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Capacity Expansion Project and Receipt of Tax Refund From Tax Loss Carryback\nIn 2016, we completed capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa that were originally announced in 2012. These projects provided us with an increase of approximately 25% in production capacity and had a total capital cost of $5.2 billion. The completion of our capacity expansion projects has reduced what had been a substantial use of liquidity in recent years. See discussion under \"Overview of CF Holdings-Items Affecting Comparability of Results-Depreciation and amortization,\" above, and \"-Capital Spending,\" below, for further information on these projects.\nA significant portion of the capital assets that were constructed as part of the capacity expansion projects qualified for bonus depreciation under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act). Under the provisions of the PATH Act, eligible capital additions are subject to 50% bonus depreciation in the year the asset is placed in service. We generated a substantial federal net operating loss in 2016, primarily as a result of the bonus depreciation deductions. In the second quarter of 2017, we received a federal tax refund of $815 million as a result of the claim to carry back the 2016 federal net operating loss to prior income tax years.\nEarly Redemption and Purchase of Senior Notes\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) at a total purchase price of approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. See discussion under \"Debt-Senior Notes-Senior Secured Notes,\" below, for further information.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less. Under our short-term investment policy, we may invest our cash balances, either directly or through mutual funds, in several types of investment-grade securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations. Securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments; those issued by state, local or other governmental entities; and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCapital Spending\nWe make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base, increase our capacity, improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $473 million in 2017 compared to $2.21 billion in 2016 with the decrease primarily due to completion in 2016 of our capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa. Capital expenditures in 2017 include approximately $110 million of payments to contractors and vendors for work completed on our capacity expansion projects in 2016.\nProjected Capital Spending\nCapital expenditures for new activity in 2018 are estimated to be in the range of $400 to $450 million. Planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, delay in the receipt of equipment, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties.\nPurchase of Publicly Traded Common Units of TNCLP\nOn February 7, 2018, we announced that TNGP elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP. See Note 26-Subsequent Event for additional information.\nGovernment Policies\nThe policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes, duties, tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials, finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world. The policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices, and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers, or farmers. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic, political and social objectives. Additionally, the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity. The impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity.\nEthanol Industry and the Renewable Fuel Standard\nCorn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38% of total U.S. corn demand. U.S. government policy, as expressed in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), is a major determinant for the ethanol market. The RFS establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels, including ethanol, that must be included in the United States' supply of fuel for transportation. In addition, the U.S. Congress, at various times, has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the RFS. While past legislation proposing changes to the RFS has not been enacted into law, there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law. Other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol, gasoline and corn. Lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry, which could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nRepatriation of Foreign Earnings and Income Taxes\nWe have operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and an interest in a joint venture in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Historically, the estimated additional U.S. and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the U.S. were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized, unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans. However, the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation. As a result, the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings, as applicable, and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods.\nIn light of changes made by the Tax Act, commencing with the 2018 tax year, the United States no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the United States, unless such earnings are subject to U.S. rules on passive income or certain anti-abuse provisions. Foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the United States.\nCash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately $152 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of $835 million was held primarily by our Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries. Historically, the cash balance held by the Canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested. As of December 31, 2017, as a result of the amounts accrued in the transition tax liability recorded as a result of the Tax Act, we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the Canadian and United Kingdom cash balances if we were to repatriate this cash in the future.\nDebt\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nWe have a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) providing for a revolving credit facility of up to $750 million with a maturity of September 18, 2020. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of $125 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. CF Industries may designate as borrowers one or more wholly owned subsidiaries that are organized in the United States or any state thereof, or the District of Columbia.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euro and British pounds, and bear interest at a per annum rate equal to an applicable eurocurrency rate or base rate plus, in either case, a specified margin, and the borrowers are required to pay an undrawn commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement and customary letter of credit fees. The specified margin and the amount of the commitment fee depend on CF Holdings' credit rating at the time.\nThe borrowers and guarantors under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which are currently comprised of CF Holdings, CF Industries and CF Holdings' wholly owned subsidiaries CF Industries Enterprises, Inc. (CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS), are referred to together herein as the Loan Parties. CF Holdings and CF Industries guaranteed the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Agreement prior to the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, and, upon the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, CFE and CFS also became guarantors of the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to specified exceptions, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires that each direct or indirect domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings that guarantees debt for borrowed money of any Loan Party in excess of $150 million become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to specified exceptions, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires a grant of a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties, to secure the obligations of the Loan Parties thereunder.\nIn addition to the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Loan Parties also guarantee the obligations under any (i) letter of credit facilities, letter of credit reimbursement agreements, letters of credit, letters of guaranty, surety bonds or similar arrangements in an aggregate amount up to $300 million and (ii) interest rate or other hedging arrangements, in each case between CF Holdings or certain of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any person that is a lender or the administrative agent under the Revolving Credit Agreement or an affiliate of such person, on the other hand, that are designated by CF Industries as Secured Bilateral LC Facilities or Secured Swap Agreements (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement (such additional obligations, the Additional\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nGuaranteed Obligations). Obligations under Secured Bilateral LC Facilities in an aggregate amount up to $300 million and obligations under Secured Swap Agreements are secured by the same security interest that secures the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants customary for a financing of this type. Prior to the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, the Revolving Credit Agreement limited the ability of non-guarantor subsidiaries of CF Holdings to incur indebtedness and limited the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to grant liens, merge or consolidate with other entities and sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity, in each case, subject to specified exceptions. The November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment modified the negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement to limit further the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to grant liens and add limitations on the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to incur debt, pay dividends, voluntarily prepay certain debt, make investments and dispose of assets, in each case, subject to specified exceptions (such further and additional limitations, the Additional Negative Covenants).\nThe financial covenants applicable to CF Holdings and its subsidiaries in the Revolving Credit Agreement (the New Financial Covenants):\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>restrict the ratio of total secured debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to a maximum of 3.75:1.00,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>require the ratio of EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated interest expense (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to be a minimum of 1.20:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending on or prior to December 31, 2018, and 1.50:1.00 thereafter, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>require the ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than or equal to 0.60:1.00.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, if on any date certain conditions were met, including (i) an absence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement, (ii) the receipt of an investment grade corporate rating for CF Holdings from two of three selected ratings agencies and (iii) the ratio of CF Holdings' total net debt to EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended being less than 3.75:1.00, CF Industries would be able to, at its option, choose to (w) suspend the Additional Negative Covenants, (x) replace the New Financial Covenants with covenants requiring the ratio of total net debt to EBITDA for the period of four fiscal consecutive quarters most recently ended to be less than or equal to 3.75:1.00 and the ratio of EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to be not less than 2.75:1.00, (y) release the collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and (z) release the guarantees supporting, and the collateral securing, the Secured Bilateral LC Facilities and the Secured Swap Agreements. Such a choice by CF Industries would commence a \"Covenant Suspension Period\" that would expire upon the Company's no longer having an investment grade corporate rating from two of three selected rating agencies. Upon the expiration of a Covenant Suspension Period, the Additional Negative Covenants and the New Financial Covenants would be reinstated, and the Loan Parties party to the Revolving Credit Agreement would be required to guarantee the Additional Guaranteed Obligations and grant a first priority security interest in substantially all of each Loan Party's assets, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties, subject to certain exceptions, to secure the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Secured Bilateral LC Facilities and the Secured Swap Agreements.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains events of default (with notice requirements and cure periods, as applicable) customary for a financing of this type, including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal, interest or fees; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; and failure to comply with specified covenants. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and after any applicable cure period, subject to specified exceptions, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite lenders is required to, accelerate the loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement or terminate the lenders' commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had excess borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $695 million (net of outstanding letters of credit of $55 million). There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016, or during 2017. Maximum borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $150 million with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 1.85%.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLetters of Credit\nIn addition to the letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, as described above, we have also entered into a bilateral agreement with capacity to issue letters of credit up to $75 million.

(CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS) became subsidiary guarantors of the Public Senior Notes.\nInterest on the Public Senior Notes is payable semiannually, and the Public Senior Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.\nIf a Change of Control occurs together with a Ratings Downgrade (as both terms are defined under the indentures governing the Public Senior Notes), CF Industries would be required to offer to repurchase each series of Public Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, in the event that a subsidiary of CF Holdings, other than CF Industries, becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any renewal, replacement or refinancing thereof), such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the Public Senior Notes, provided that such requirement will no longer apply with respect to the Public Senior Notes due 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 following the repayment of the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020 or the subsidiaries of ours, other than CF Industries, otherwise becoming no longer subject to such a requirement to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020.\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\napproximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes). The aggregate purchase price was approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn November 21, 2016, CF Industries issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.400% senior secured notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Senior Secured Notes). The net proceeds, after deducting discounts and offering expenses, from the issuance and sale of the Senior Secured Notes were approximately $1.23 billion. CF Industries used approximately $1.18 billion of the net proceeds for the prepayment (including payment of a make-whole amount of approximately $170 million and accrued interest) in full of the outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 2022, 2025 and 2027 (Private Senior Notes) issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015.\nInterest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1 beginning on June 1, 2017, and the Senior Secured Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.\nUnder the terms of the applicable indenture, the Senior Secured Notes of each series are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by CF Holdings and each current and future domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) that from time to time is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The requirement for any subsidiary of CF Holdings to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes of a series will apply only until, and the subsidiary guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes of a series will be automatically released upon, the latest to occur of (a) CF Holdings having an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there being no default or event of default under the applicable Indenture, (b) the retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2018 or the subsidiaries of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) otherwise becoming no longer subject to the requirement, described in the second paragraph under \"-Public Senior Notes,\" above, to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and (c) the retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2020 or the subsidiaries of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) otherwise becoming no longer subject to the requirement, described in the second paragraph under \"-Public Senior Notes,\" above, to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2020. In accordance with the applicable indenture, CFE and CFS, in addition to CF Holdings, guaranteed the Senior Secured Notes of each series upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the obligations under each series of Senior Secured Notes and each guarantor's related guarantee are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of CF Industries, CF Holdings and the subsidiary guarantors, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties (the Collateral). The obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, together with certain letter of credit, hedging and similar obligations and future pari passu secured indebtedness, will be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes. The liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes of a series and the related guarantees will be automatically released and the covenant under the applicable indenture limiting dispositions of Collateral will no longer apply if, on any date after the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, CF Holdings has an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there is no default or event of default under the applicable indenture.\nUnder each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, specified changes of control involving CF Holdings or CF Industries, when accompanied by a ratings downgrade, as defined with respect to the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes, constitute change of control repurchase events. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to the 2021 Notes or the 2026 Notes, as applicable, unless CF Industries has exercised its option to redeem such Senior Secured Notes, CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, to incur liens on certain assets to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, to sell or transfer Collateral, to merge or consolidate with other entities and to sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity. Each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest on the applicable Senior Secured Notes; failure to comply with other covenants or agreements under the indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; the failure of CF Holdings' or certain subsidiaries' guarantees of the applicable Senior Secured Notes to be enforceable; lack of validity or perfection of any lien\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nsecuring the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees with respect to Collateral having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than a specified amount; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Under each indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of an event of default arising from one of the specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the applicable Senior Secured Notes would become due and payable immediately, and, in the case of any other event of default (other than an event of default related to CF Industries' and CF Holdings' reporting obligations), the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable Senior Secured Notes then outstanding may declare all of such Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.\nPrivate Senior Notes\nThe senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes), issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015, were governed by the terms of a note purchase agreement (as amended, including by an amendment effective September 7, 2016, the Note Purchase Agreement). The Private Senior Notes were guaranteed by CF Holdings. All obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement were unsecured.\nOn November 21, 2016, we prepaid in full the outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our Private Senior Notes. The prepayment of $1.18 billion included the payment of a make-whole amount of approximately $170 million and accrued interest. Loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million on our consolidated statements of operations excludes $3 million of the make-whole payment, which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nBridge Credit Agreement\nOn September 18, 2015, in connection with our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, CF Holdings and CF Industries entered into a senior unsecured 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders' commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically. There were no borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. See Note 12-Interest Expense for additional information.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nOur Board of Directors (the Board) authorized certain programs to repurchase shares of our common stock. Each of these programs permitted repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market, through privately-negotiated transactions, through block transactions or otherwise. Our management determined the manner, timing and amount of repurchases based on the evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors. On August 6, 2014, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $1 billion of the common stock of CF Holdings through December 31, 2016 (the 2014 Program). As of December 31, 2016, 15.9 million shares had been repurchased for an aggregate expenditure of $900 million. The remaining $100 million of share repurchase authorization under the 2014 Program expired on December 31, 2016. No share repurchase programs were authorized by the Board in 2017.\nForward Sales and Customer Advances\nWe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. Therefore, our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment.\nCustomer advances, which typically represent a portion of the contract's sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $89 million and $42 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWhile customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity, the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers' outlook of future market fundamentals. During periods of declining prices, such as the current environment, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices. If the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Additionally, borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nUnder our forward sales programs, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. These delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us. Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer's inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales.\nNatural Gas Prices\nNatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN and other nitrogen products. Expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs. For example, natural gas costs, including realized gains and losses, comprised approximately 47% of our total production costs in 2017. As a result, natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity.\nBecause most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations, natural gas prices in North America have declined since 2008, but are subject to volatility. During 2017, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in North America, reached a low of $2.44 per MMBtu on February 28, 2017 and a high of $3.65 per MMBtu on three consecutive days in January 2017. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub reached a low of $1.49 per MMBtu on three consecutive days in March 2016 and a high of $3.77 per MMBtu on December 8, 2016.\nWe also have manufacturing facilities located in the United Kingdom. These facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in Europe. The major natural gas trading point for the United Kingdom is the National Balancing Point (NBP). During 2017, the daily closing price at NBP reached a low of $3.30 per MMBtu on June 15, 2017 and a high of $9.00 per MMBtu on December 12, 2017. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, the daily closing price at NBP reached a low of $2.80 per MMBtu on September 1, September 12 and September 14, 2016, and a high of $9.00 per MMBtu on December 12, 2017.\nNatural gas costs in our cost of sales, including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, increased 11% per MMBtu in 2017 from 2016.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based fertilizers. From time to time, we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Because we use derivative instruments, volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the value of the derivatives. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market losses (gains) on natural gas derivatives of $61 million, $(260) million and $176 million, respectively, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. We control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks, other major financial institutions or large energy companies, and, in most cases, the use of International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting arrangements. The ISDA agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement.\nThe ISDA agreements to most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade, our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. The Revolving Credit Agreement, at any time when it is secured, provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to, or affiliates of parties to, the Revolving Credit Agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives. In the event the Revolving Credit Agreement becomes unsecured, separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was $12 million and zero, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the credit-\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nrisk-related contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 35.9 million MMBtus and 183.0 million MMBtus, respectively. At both December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts.\nEmbedded Derivative Liability\nUnder the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of $5 million to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026.\nThis obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as an embedded derivative and its value is included in other liabilities. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe contributed $82 million to our pension plans in 2017. The contributions in 2017 include a voluntary contribution of $59 million made in the second quarter of 2017. We expect to contribute approximately $41 million to our pension plans in 2018.\nDistributions on Noncontrolling Interest in CFN\nThe CFN Board of Managers approved semi-annual distribution payments during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, in accordance with the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of CFN, as follows: Table 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Approved and paid\n</td> <td>Distribution Period\n</td> <td>Distribution Amount\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter of 2018\n</td> <td>Six months ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter of 2017\n</td> <td>Six months ended June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter of 2017\n</td> <td>Six months ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter of 2016\n</td> <td>February 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $1.63 billion as compared to $617 million in 2016, an increase of $1,014 million. The increase was primarily due to working capital changes including the receipt of our $815 million income tax refund related to the claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior income tax years. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also a result of entering 2017 with a lower level of customer advances than 2016 due to customer reluctance to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment. These increases were partially offset by higher contributions to our pension plans. In 2017, we contributed $82 million to our pension plans compared to $23 million in 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $617 million as compared to $1.21 billion in 2015, a decline of $590 million. The decline resulted primarily from lower net earnings during 2016 due to lower selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply, partially offset by lower amounts of cash used for working capital purposes. Lower working capital levels in accounts receivable and inventory, plus lower amounts paid for income taxes and certain income tax refunds received in 2016, contributed to the reduction in cash used for working capital. Favorable changes in working capital also included a greater proportion of sales paid in 2016 as compared to the prior year period as we entered 2016 with a lower level of customer advances than in 2015 due to customers' hesitancy to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $408 million in 2017 compared to $2.18 billion in 2016. This $1.77 billion decrease is due primarily to lower capital expenditures as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa at the end of 2016. During 2017, capital expenditures totaled $473 million compared to $2.21 billion in 2016. The $2.98 billion net cash used in investing activities in 2015 included $2.47 billion in capital expenditures and the 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us for a net cash payment of $552 million, which was net of cash acquired of $18 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.56 billion in 2017 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.44 billion in 2016 and $77 million in 2015. In 2017, we paid $1.15 billion in connection with the early redemption of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2018 Notes, the purchase of approximately $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes pursuant to a tender offer and premiums paid for the early retirement of long-term debt. In 2016, CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for $2.8 billion. In 2017 and 2016, we distributed $131 million and $119 million, respectively, to the noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP. In 2015, we distributed $45 million to the noncontrolling interest in TNCLP. The increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the CHS strategic venture, which increased the distributions by $79 million, representing the distributions paid to CHS in the third quarter of 2016 for the distribution period ended June 30, 2016.\nIn 2016, we received proceeds of approximately $1.24 billion, net of discounts, from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes which were used to fund the prepayment of the $1.0 billion of Private Senior Notes and the related make-whole payment of $170 million. In 2015, we issued the Private Senior Notes and received proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. No share repurchases were made during 2017 and 2016 compared to cash used for share repurchases in 2015 of $556 million.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment purchases and plant improvements\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation(2)\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(3)(4)\n</td> <td>661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions to pension plans(5)\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(6)(7)(8)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Based on debt balances before discounts, offering expenses and interest rates as of December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes anticipated expenditures under certain contracts to transport finished product to and from our facilities.

The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to eleven years and the barge charter commitments range from one to seven years. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one to five years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party. See Note 23-Leases for additional information.\nWe do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, rebates, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize expenses, assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. U.S. income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. We adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.\nHistorically, a deferred income tax liability was recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture that were considered to not be permanently reinvested. No deferred income tax liability was recorded for the remainder of our investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture, which we believed to be permanently reinvested. In light of changes made by the Tax Act, the Company is evaluating whether it will continue to treat foreign subsidiary earnings as being permanently reinvested.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nAs a large commercial enterprise with international operations, our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors. The most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation in the countries in which we operate, changes in the geographic mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses, and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint venture that could be subjected to U.S. taxation. It is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense, net income and liquidity in future periods.\nWe operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions. The taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe, including the countries in which we operate. The tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries. As a result, there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances. We work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions. However, there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical. As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of $151 million, which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions. This amount represents our best estimate of the potential amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions. Differences in interpretation of the tax laws, including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions, can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nWe review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with U.S. GAAP in order to assess recoverability. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, selling prices, raw material costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process. The recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Adverse changes in demand for our products, increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review.\nThe recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value, and the reduction in value is other than temporary, the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings.\nPLNL is our joint venture investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the NGC pursuant to the NGC Contract. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which have reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. The NGC Contract had an initial expiration date of September 2018 and has been extended on the same terms until September 2023. Any NGC commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price. PLNL and NGC are currently parties to arbitration proceedings where the main issue remaining in dispute is PLNL's claims for damages for past and ongoing curtailments.\nAlthough the joint venture believes its claims against NGC to be meritorious, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration. There are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture, beyond 2023, that are uncertain at this time, including the quantities of gas NGC will make available, the cost of such gas, the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing. As part of our 2016 impairment assessment of our equity method investment in PLNL, we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a $134 million impairment charge. Previously, in 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $62 million related to our equity method investment in PLNL. The carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL at December 31, 2017 is $108 million. If NGC does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to PLNL at prices that permit profitable operations, PLNL may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in PLNL.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. Our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value. If after performing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further testing is performed. However, if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test, we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, if needed, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. We identified no goodwill impairment in our 2017, 2016 or 2015 reviews. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.37 billion and $2.35 billion, respectively.\nIntangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of Terra Industries Inc. consist of customer relationships, which are being amortized over a period of 18 years. The intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of CF Fertilisers UK consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a period of approximately 20 years. Our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nPension Assets and Liabilities\nPension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation (PBO) are discount rates and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, an adjusted retail price index (RPI). Key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on assets (EROA) and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, RPI.\nThe December 31, 2017 PBO was computed based on a weighted-average discount rate of 3.6% for our North America plans and 2.5% for our United Kingdom plans, which were based on yields for high-quality (AA rated or better) fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of December 31. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. The weighted-average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2017 was 4.0% for North America plans and 2.8% for United Kingdom plans. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The 4.2% weighted-average EROA used to calculate pension expense in 2017 for our North America plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. The 4.6% weighted-average EROA used to calculate pension expense in 2017 for our United Kingdom plans is based on expected long-term performance of underlying investments. The EROA for both North America and United Kingdom plans are adjusted for expenses and diversification bonuses. The 3.2% RPI used to calculate our United Kingdom plan PBO and the 3.3% RPI used to calculate 2017 pension expense is developed using the Bank of England implied retail price inflation curve, which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and index-linked government bonds.\nFor North America qualified pension plans, our PBO was $805 million as of December 31, 2017, which was $67 million higher than pension plan assets. For our United Kingdom pension plans, our PBO was $590 million as of December 31, 2017 which was $176 million higher than pension plan assets.

(TNGP), the sole general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement. The purchase price of $84.033 per unit was determined under the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement as the average of the daily closing prices per common unit for the 20 consecutive trading days beginning with January 5, 2018 and ending with February 2, 2018. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. We intend to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018 purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP, and the common units representing limited partner interests will cease to be publicly traded or listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nIndustry Factors\nWe operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below.\nGlobal Supply and Demand Factors\nOur products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand and different cost factors.\nHistorically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, gross domestic product growth, changes in dietary habits, planted acreage, and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short-term fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, governmental regulations, including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of bio-fuels or industrial nitrogen products and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key exporting/consuming countries such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, among others, often play a major role in shaping near-term market fundamentals. The economics of nitrogen-based fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade. Raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal; supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities.\nOver the last decade, strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities, which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity. As a result, global nitrogen fertilizer capacity increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating a surplus of global nitrogen capacity in the market, and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. In addition, global feedstock commodity prices declined, including coal and oil-linked gas, contributing to the lower nitrogen fertilizer prices.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nGlobal Trade in Fertilizer\nIn addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values, the availability of credit and governmental trade policies. The development of additional natural gas reserves in North America over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world, making North American nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive. These lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in North America, including our capacity expansion projects in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa, which were completed in December 2016. Changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world.\nImports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers located in the Middle East, Ukraine, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, North Africa, Russia and China have been major exporters to North America.\nFarmers' Economics\nThe demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns, crop prices and the types of crops planted.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Results\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\" or \"Tax Reform\") which includes a number of changes to U.S. tax law that affect us. As a result of the Tax Act we recognized a $491 million income tax benefit, which has a significant impact on our 2017 financial results. This impact generally results from the following two major provisions:\n \u2022 Impact of Tax Rate Change on Deferred Tax Liabilities - The most significant impact of Tax Reform is the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This change necessitates the revaluation of all of our U.S. deferred tax balances which resulted in an income tax benefit of $552 million that was recorded in 2017. \n \u2022 Transition Tax (Repatriation Tax) on Foreign Earnings and Profits - Tax Reform requires us to pay U.S. tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. Foreign earnings held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at a 15.5% rate, and the remaining earnings are taxed at an 8% rate. We intend to elect to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period and have recognized a tax charge and liability of $57 million in 2017 for this item.  Nitrogen Fertilizer Selling Prices\nA significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016 and 2017, including an increase in production capacity located in North America, which has further increased supply. Additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2018. As a result, we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.\nThe U.S. Gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there. Through most of 2016, nitrogen pricing at the U.S. Gulf declined, often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to continued imports from various exporting regions and delayed North American buyer interest as a result of greater global nitrogen supply availability. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multi-year lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of 2016. Early in the first quarter of 2017, prices began to increase as the supply and demand balance tightened in anticipation of spring fertilizer demand for the planting and growing season. However, as the first quarter progressed, increased imports into North America increased fertilizer supply in the region, which pressured selling prices downward as the quarter ended. During the second quarter of 2017, excess supply through imports into the United States that occurred in the first quarter of 2017 continued in the second quarter, negatively impacting selling prices. During the third quarter of 2017, prices hit yearly lows and then selling prices for most nitrogen products increased throughout the quarter, ending higher than at the beginning of the quarter, driven by significantly lower Chinese exports, higher energy and production costs in parts of the world, a weaker U.S. dollar and strong global demand. During the fourth quarter of 2017, certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur, were delayed, and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing.\nThe significant price fluctuations we have experienced in 2017 are symptoms of a market in transition as new capacity comes on line and global trade flows adjust, and this transition is not complete. We expect the final set of North American capacity additions to come fully on line by mid-2018. Should imports of nitrogen products into North America continue at high rates, the oversupply in the region will continue, which could lead to lower prices, similar to those experienced in early 2017. New global nitrogen capacity additions coming on line after 2018 are expected to be lower than recent years, which will support the market transition or more balanced supply and demand.\nThe greater global nitrogen supply availability and resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices significantly impacted our results. The average selling price for our products for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $207 per ton, $217 per ton and $314 per ton, respectively. The decline in average selling prices from 2016 to 2017 reduced net sales by $293 million, while the decline in average selling prices from 2015 to 2016 reduced net sales by $1.4 billion. In addition to the direct impact of lower selling prices, during periods of declining prices, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, certain significant items impacted our financial results. The following table and related discussion outline these significant items and how they impacted the comparability of our financial results during these periods.

Descriptions of items below that refer to amounts in the table above, refer to the pre-tax amounts.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDepreciation and amortization\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense recognized in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $883 million, $678 million and $480 million, respectively. This increase in depreciation expense reflects the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing in service all five of the new plants prior to the end of 2016. The capacity expansion projects were originally announced in 2012 and included the construction of new ammonia, urea, and UAN plants at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal, Iowa complex. These plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25%, improved our product mix flexibility at Donaldsonville, and improved our ability to serve upper-Midwest urea customers from our Port Neal location. The following table indicates the quarter in which each of the five expansion plants were placed in service.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter placed in service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expansion plant location\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Donaldsonville Urea\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q1 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Donaldsonville UAN\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Donaldsonville Ammonia\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Port Neal Ammonia and Urea\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation expense pertaining to each of our capacity expansion plants commenced once the applicable plant was placed in service.\nUnrealized net mark-to-market loss (gain) on natural gas derivatives\nNatural gas is typically the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. This can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market losses (gains) on natural gas derivatives of $61 million, $(260) million and $176 million, respectively.\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans\nIn 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized losses (gains) of $2 million, $93 million and $(8) million, respectively, from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily British pound and Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested.\nEquity method investment tax contingency accrual\nThe Trinidad tax authority (the Board of Inland Revenue) has issued a tax assessment against our equity method investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, PLNL, related to a dispute over whether tax depreciation must be claimed during a tax holiday period that was granted to PLNL under the Trinidad Fiscal Incentives Act. The tax holiday was granted as an incentive to construct PLNL's ammonia plant. Based on the facts and circumstances of this matter, PLNL recorded a tax contingency accrual, which reduced our equity in earnings of PLNL for 2017 by approximately $7 million reflecting our 50% ownership interest. In early 2018, PLNL settled this matter with the Board of Inland Revenue for the amounts accrued.\nStrategic venture with CHS\nWe commenced a strategic venture with CHS on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for $2.8 billion. CHS also began receiving deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to approximately 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its minority equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. The amounts of distributions from CFN to us and CHS are based generally on the profitability of CFN and determined based on the volume of granular urea and UAN sold by CFN to us and CHS pursuant to supply agreements, less a formula driven amount based primarily on the cost of natural gas used to produce the granular urea and UAN, and adjusted for the allocation of items such as operational efficiencies and overhead amounts.\nWe began recognizing the noncontrolling interest pertaining to CHS' ownership interest in CFN on February 1, 2016. During 2017 and 2016, we recognized earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN of $73 million and\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n$93 million, respectively. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information regarding our strategic venture with CHS.\nUnder the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of $5 million to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026. This obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative. During 2017 and 2016, included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations is a net loss of $4 million and $23 million, respectively.\nDebt activity\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) pursuant to a tender offer. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we took certain steps with respect to the Revolving Credit Agreement and our senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes). On November 21, 2016, we prepaid the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Private Senior Notes, and paid the related make-whole amount of approximately $170 million. We made the prepayment and make-whole payment using the proceeds from an offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2021 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2026 (collectively referred to as the Senior Secured Notes\u201d). We recognized $167 million of the $170 million cash make-whole payment on the Private Senior Notes as a loss on debt extinguishment, with the $3 million remainder being a debt modification cost that is being amortized over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nIn connection with the completion of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes in November 2016, certain amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement became effective. The amendments included, among other things, changes in and additions to the financial and other covenants and a reduction in the size of the facility from $1.5 billion to $750 million.\nIn conjunction with our debt restructuring, including amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement, we recognized $18 million of debt issuance and amendment fees in 2016. See further discussion under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 11-Financing Agreements for additional information.\nCapacity expansion projects\nOur capacity expansion projects were completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Capacity expansion project expenses in 2016 and 2015 of $73 million and $51 million, respectively, are included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations and generally consisted of administrative costs and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization.\nStart-up costs of $52 million, which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the ammonia plants, were incurred in 2016 and are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Losses on foreign currency derivatives of $22 million in 2015 are included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations and relate to hedges of European euro denominated equipment purchased as part of the capacity expansion projects.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nTransaction costs and termination of agreement with OCI\nOn August 6, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the Combination Agreement) to combine with the European, North American and global distribution businesses of OCI N.V. (OCI). On May 22, 2016, CF Holdings, OCI and the other parties to the Combination Agreement entered into a termination agreement (the Termination Agreement) under which the parties agreed to terminate the Combination Agreement by mutual written consent. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, CF Holdings paid OCI a termination fee of $150 million. Under the Termination Agreement, the parties to the Combination Agreement also agreed to release each other from any and all claims, actions, obligations, liabilities, expenses and fees in connection with, arising out of or related to the Combination Agreement and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby (other than the confidentiality agreement between CF Holdings and OCI) or the transactions contemplated therein or thereby.\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI and our strategic venture with CHS. This includes the $150 million termination fee paid to OCI in the second quarter of 2016, which is described above, and costs for various consulting and legal services. In 2015, we incurred $57 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, our strategic venture with CHS, and the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nOn September 18, 2015, in connection with our proposed combination with OCI, we entered into a senior unsecured 364-day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders' commitment under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically and we recognized $28 million in bridge loan commitment fees. In 2015, we recognized $6 million of fees related to the initiation of the bridge loan.\nCF Fertilisers UK acquisition\nOn July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us for total consideration of $570 million, and CF Fertilisers UK became a wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the acquisition, we recognized a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity investment in CF Fertilisers UK. CF Fertilisers UK Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Limited), a wholly owned subsidiary of CF Fertilisers UK, operates two nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United Kingdom, in the cities of Ince and Billingham. This transaction increased our manufacturing capacity with the acquisition of CF Fertilisers UK's nitrogen manufacturing complexes. The Ince complex is located in northwestern England and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, an AN plant and three NPK plants. The Billingham complex is located in the Teesside chemical area in northeastern England, and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, a carbon dioxide plant and an AN fertilizer plant.\nEquity method investments\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a gain of $14 million related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility. During 2015, we recognized a loss of $43 million related to the sale of our 50% investment in Keytrade AG and the sale of our 50% investment in an ammonia storage joint venture in Houston, Texas.\nOur equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, includes an impairment charge of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million and $62 million, respectively. PLNL is our joint venture investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) pursuant to a gas sales contract (the NGC Contract). PLNL had experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below, for additional information.\nSee Note 7-Equity Method Investments for additional information regarding our equity method investments.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nFinancial Executive Summary\nNet earnings (loss)\nWe reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $358 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $277 million in 2016, or an increase in net earnings between the periods of $635 million. Tax Reform had a significant impact on our reported results in 2017 as we recognized $491 million of income in our tax provision related to the enactment of Tax Reform in the United States. Further information regarding the impact of Tax Reform can be found above under \"Items Affecting Comparability of Results-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\" Diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders was $1.53 in 2017 compared to diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $1.19 in 2016, or an increase of $2.72 per share. The impact of Tax Reform added $2.10 to diluted earnings per share in 2017.\n(Loss) earnings before income taxes\nEarnings before income taxes increased by $101 million to a loss of $125 million in 2017 from a loss of $226 million in 2016. The increase in earnings before income taxes is due to a combination of the following three categories of items which are described below:\n \u2022 $617 million of charges that were recognized in 2016 that did not reoccur in 2017; partially offset by \n \u2022 $410 million reduction in gross margin from operations; and \n \u2022 $108 million increase in net interest expense.  Significant charges in 2016\nIn 2016, we recognized $617 million of certain significant charges from the following items:\n \u2022 Transaction costs of $179 million pertaining to our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI (that was ultimately terminated in 2016) and costs associated with establishing our strategic venture with CHS. \n \u2022 An impairment charge of $134 million related to our investment in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited. \n \u2022 We took actions in both 2016 and 2017 to make modifications to our outstanding debt in response to changes in market conditions. Losses on debt extinguishments declined by $114 million as 2016 had losses of $167 million and 2017 had losses of $53 million. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses declined by $190 million in 2017 from an expense of $208 million in 2016 to an expense of $18 million in 2017. Other operating expenses are primarily pertaining to losses on foreign currency exchange rate impacts of the British pound and Canadian dollar on certain intercompany loans, certain costs pertaining to our capacity expansion projects and fair value adjustments for a derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS.  Gross margin from operations in 2017\nAs discussed earlier in \"Overview of CF Holdings-Industry Factors and Items Affecting Comparability of Results,\" our operating results continue to be impacted by a surplus of capacity in the nitrogen industry, which has impacted product selling prices. Industry pricing conditions in 2017 declined early in the year to multi-year lows as oversupply conditions persisted, but selling prices rose as the year ended when supply and demand conditions were more in balance due to delays in the start-up of certain new industry capacity and stronger demand in certain regions. Our results in 2017 also included the full impact of all of our new capacity expansion plants. As a result, we set both production and sales volume records in 2017.\nOur gross margin declined by $410 million in 2017 to $430 million from $840 million in 2016. The following major factors contributed to the decline in gross margin:\n \u2022 a higher unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives, which decreased gross margin by $321 million as 2017 included a $61 million loss and 2016 included a $260 million gain, \n \u2022 a decrease in average selling prices of 5%, which reduced gross margin by $293 million, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In 2017, the average selling prices for ammonia, UAN and granular urea declined by 13%, 11%, and 3%, respectively, while the average selling price for AN increased by 10%, \n \u2022 an increase in physical natural gas costs in 2017, partially offset by the impact of natural gas derivatives that settled in the period, which decreased gross margin by $162 million as compared to 2016, and \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n \u2022 the impact of an increase in depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact from higher sales volume, of $160 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to the completion and start-up of our capacity expansion projects, \n \u2022 partially offset by an increase in sales volume of 18%, which increased gross margin by $275 million, primarily driven by an increase in sales volume for ammonia and granular urea of 43% and 21%, respectively, \n \u2022 targeted cost reduction initiatives and production efficiencies due to increased volume, and \n \u2022 start-up costs of $52 million in 2016 for the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities.  Interest expense-net\nNet interest expense increased by $108 million to $303 million in 2017 from $195 million in 2016. The increase is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects in 2016.\nCash Position\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $835 million at December 31, 2017, a decline of $329 million from $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016. During 2017, our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events, which are further described in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\n \u2022 Receipt of a federal tax refund of $815 million due to the carryback of certain tax losses primarily arising from our capacity expansion projects \n \u2022 Early redemption and purchase of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes due in 2018 and 2020 \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nResults of Consolidated Operations\nThe following table presents our consolidated results of operations and supplemental data:

The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.\nOur total net sales increased $445 million, or 12%, to $4.13 billion in 2017 compared to $3.69 billion in 2016 due to an 18% increase in sales volume, which increased net sales by $738 million, partially offset by a 5% decrease in average selling prices, which reduced net sales by $293 million.\nAverage selling prices were $207 per ton in 2017 compared to $217 per ton in 2016 due primarily to lower ammonia, UAN and granular urea average selling prices in 2017. Selling prices were negatively impacted by greater supply availability which continues to pressure selling prices globally. During the fourth quarter of 2017, certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur, were delayed, and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing.\nThe increase in total sales volume of 18% was due primarily to higher ammonia and granular urea sales volumes, driven by increased production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in December 2016.\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, purchased product costs, and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments, maintenance, direct labor, depreciation and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers.\nOur cost of sales increased $855 million, or 30%, from 2016 to 2017. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, higher unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives and higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, in addition to higher depreciation expense related to the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service. These increases to cost of sales were partially offset by targeted cost reduction initiatives, production efficiencies due to increased volume in 2017 and the absence of start-up costs of the new ammonia plant at our Donaldsonville facility and the new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal facility that occurred in 2016. The cost of sales per ton averaged $185 in 2017, a 10% increase from $168 per ton in 2016. Cost of sales includes a $61 million unrealized net mark-to-market loss in 2017 compared to a $260 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain in 2016. Additionally, realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, increased 11% from $3.07 per MMBtu in 2016 to $3.40 in 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payroll-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees, including those for corporate initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $18 million to $192 million in 2017 from $174 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to the combination of certain corporate office initiatives and higher incentive compensation due to improvements in operating performance.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs consist of various consulting and legal services associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI that was terminated on May 22, 2016; our strategic venture with CHS, which began on February 1, 2016; and our July 31, 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs, including the $150 million termination fee paid to OCI in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the Combination Agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOther Operating-Net\nOther operating-net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations and costs associated with our capacity expansion projects. Costs included in \"other costs\" can include foreign exchange gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives, costs associated with our closed facilities, amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.\nOther operating-net was $18 million of expense in 2017 compared to $208 million of expense in 2016. The decreased expense was due primarily to a $93 million loss in 2016 from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily British pound and Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested. Due to a restructuring of certain intercompany loans, we did not incur the same level of foreign exchange rate impacts in 2017. The decreased expense is also due to expansion project expenses in 2016 of $73 million, generally consisting of administrative and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization, and a $23 million charge representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 8-Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Operating Affiliates\nEquity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates primarily consists of our 50% ownership interest in PLNL. We include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in PLNL as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities. Our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition. In 2016, equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates also includes impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates was $9 million of earnings in 2017 compared to $145 million of losses in 2016. Earnings in 2017 includes a gain of $14 million related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a $134 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL. For additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL, see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,\" below, and Note 7-Equity Method Investments.\nInterest Expense-Net\nOur interest expense-net includes the interest expense on our long-term debt, amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees pursuant to our Revolving Credit Agreement. Capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs. Our interest expense-net also includes interest income, which represents amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nNet interest expense increased by $108 million to $303 million in 2017 from $195 million in 2015. The $108 million increase was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects. In 2016, capitalized interest was $166 million compared to $2 million in 2017. Net interest expense in 2016 also includes the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of $28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Upon the termination of the proposed combination with OCI, the unamortized portion of these fees was expensed.\nDuring 2016, due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we modified the Revolving Credit Agreement by reducing its size from $2.0 billion to $750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms. As a result of these changes, we recognized $16 million of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense in 2016.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLoss on debt extinguishment of $53 million in 2017 primarily consists of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. Loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million in 2016 consists of the make-whole payment, which resulted from our November 21, 2016 prepayment of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million excludes $3 million (of the $170 million make-whole payment), which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Provision\nOur income tax benefit for 2017 was $575 million on a pre-tax loss of $125 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $68 million on a pre-tax loss of $226 million in the prior year. The higher income tax benefit in 2017 is due primarily to the impact of the Tax Act, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $491 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe primary impact of the Tax Act is the revaluation of all of our U.S. deferred tax balances, as result of the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $552 million that was recorded in 2017. This income tax benefit was partially offset by a tax charge and liability of $57 million, which represents our best estimate of the transition tax, or repatriation tax, on foreign earnings and profits, as described above under \"Items Affecting Comparability-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\"\nIn addition, in both years, our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP, as our consolidated income tax (benefit) provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $92 million and $119 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are included in our pre-tax loss, impact the effective tax rate in both years. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nDue primarily to the $491 million income tax benefit from the Tax Act, we recognized a $575 million income tax benefit in 2017 on a pre-tax loss of $125 million. Our effective tax rate in 2017, exclusive of the tax benefit from the Tax Act and exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $92 million from our pre-tax loss, results in an effective tax rate of 38.8%. Our effective tax rate in 2016, exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $119 million from our pre-tax income, resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.6%.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million, which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our 2016 income tax provision does not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction, which reduced our 2016 effective tax rate.\nBoth 2017 and 2016 were impacted by additional discrete tax items. See Note 9-Income Taxes for additional information.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the net earnings attributable to the 24.7% interest of the publicly-held common units of TNCLP. We own approximately 75.3% of TNCLP and outside investors own the remaining 24.7%. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11% CHS minority equity interest in CFN, a subsidiary of CF Holdings, purchased for $2.8 billion on February 1, 2016.\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $27 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to lower earnings from both CFN and TNCLP as both were impacted by lower average selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. The earnings of CFN were also impacted by higher natural gas prices and the impact of higher depreciation as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service.\nDiluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nDiluted net earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders, including the impact of Tax Reform, increased $2.72 to earnings of $1.53 per share in 2017 from a loss of $1.19 per share in 2016. This increase is due primarily to the impact of Tax Reform partially offset by lower gross margin primarily driven by an increase in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, the impact of lower selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability, higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, and higher depreciation expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales\nOur total net sales decreased $623 million, or 14%, to $3.69 billion in 2016 compared to $4.31 billion in 2015. The impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition increased our net sales by $269 million, or 6%. The remaining decline in our net sales of $892 million, or 21%, was due to a 31% decline in average selling prices partially offset by a 14% increase in sales volume.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nAverage selling prices, excluding the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition impact, were $218 per ton in 2016 compared to $318 per ton in 2015 due primarily to lower selling prices across all products. Selling prices were negatively impacted by excess global nitrogen supply. Pricing for nitrogen fertilizer products in the U.S. Gulf declined during most of 2016, often trading below parity with other international pricing points, as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multi-year lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of the year.\nOur total sales volume increased by 24% from 2015 to 2016. The impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition increased our sales volume by 10%. The remaining increase in our sales volume of 14% was due primarily to greater granular urea and UAN volume available for sale due to our completed capacity expansion projects, partly offset by lower ammonia sales volume due to lower demand in North America during the fall application season. In addition, our ammonia sales volumes were lower in 2016 as we upgraded existing ammonia production as a result of our granular urea and UAN capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales increased $84 million, or 3%, from 2015 to 2016. The overall increase in cost of sales is due primarily to the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased cost of sales by $251 million, or 9%, as 2016 includes a full year of CF Fertilisers UK results and 2015 includes five months of CF Fertilisers UK results. The remaining decrease in our cost of sales of $167 million, or 6%, was due primarily to the combination of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives and lower realized natural gas costs, partly offset by higher capacity expansion project related costs. Cost of sales includes a $260 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain in 2016 as compared to a $176 million unrealized net mark-to-market loss in 2015. Realized natural gas costs, including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivatives, declined 6% from $3.28 per MMBtu in 2015 to $3.07 per MMBtu in 2016 as natural gas prices were lower in 2016, particularly in the first half of the year with high storage levels and strong production in North America, although natural gas prices increased towards the end of 2016.\nCapacity expansion project costs, including depreciation expense, which commenced once the respective expansion plant was placed in service, totaled $116 million in 2016. Start-up costs, which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the new ammonia plants for our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa plants, totaled $52 million in 2016.\nCost of goods sold per ton declined $33 per ton, or 16%, from $201 in 2015 to $168 in 2016, as a result of the factors noted above.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $4 million to $174 million in 2016 from $170 million in 2015. The increase was due primarily to the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, partly offset by lower costs for corporate office initiatives and lower intangible asset amortization expense.\nTransaction Costs\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI and our strategic venture with CHS. This includes the $150 million termination fee paid by CF Holdings to OCI in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the Combination Agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services. In 2015, we incurred $57 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, our strategic venture with CHS and the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nOther Operating-Net\nOther operating-net was $208 million in 2016 compared to $92 million in 2015. The increased expense was due primarily to $93 million of realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions primarily related to British pound denominated intercompany debt that has not been permanently invested. In addition, the increased expense also reflects higher expansion project costs pertaining to our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization and the loss of $23 million representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 8-Fair Value Measurements for additional information. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives of $22 million.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nEquity in (Losses) Earnings of Operating Affiliates\nEquity in (losses) earnings of operating affiliates decreased by $110 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to a $134 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $62 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL. The remaining decrease was due primarily to lower operating results from PLNL, which included costs of $21 million that were incurred during 2016 related to a planned maintenance activity at the PLNL ammonia plant that resulted in the shutdown of the plant for approximately 45 days and the impact of lower ammonia selling prices in 2016 compared to 2015. For additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL, see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,\" below, and Note 7-Equity Method Investments.\nInterest Expense-Net\nNet interest expense increased by $64 million to $195 million in 2016 from $131 million in 2015. The $64 million increase in net interest expense was due primarily to the combination of higher debt levels due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of Private Senior Notes in September 2015 and debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to the restructuring of our debt and the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2016. Due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we modified the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2016 by reducing its size from $2.0 billion to $750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms. As a result of these changes, we recognized $16 million of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense. The increase in interest expense-net in 2016 also includes the amortization of capitalized Bridge Credit Agreement fees of $28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain of the OCI businesses. We also recorded capitalized interest of $166 million in 2016 related primarily to our capacity expansion projects compared to $154 million in 2015.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLoss on debt extinguishment of $167 million in 2016 consists of the make-whole payment, which resulted from our November 21, 2016 prepayment of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. This amount excludes $3 million (of the $170 million make-whole payment), which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Provision\nOur income tax benefit for 2016 was $68 million on a pre-tax loss of $226 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.0%, compared to an income tax provision of $396 million on pre-tax income of $1.06 billion, or an effective tax rate of 37.4%, in the prior year.\nState income taxes for 2016 were favorably impacted by investment tax credits of $13 million related to capital assets placed in service at our production facilities in Oklahoma that are indefinitely available to offset income taxes in that jurisdiction in future years. Our effective state income tax rate was also reduced as a result of the changes to our legal entity structure effected in the first quarter of 2016 as part of our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nState income taxes for 2016 includes a tax benefit of $46 million, net of federal tax effect, for state net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe income tax provision for 2016 includes the tax impact of the recaptured U.S. manufacturing profits deductions claimed in prior years that will not be deductible as a result of our intention to carryback the tax net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 to those prior tax years.\nNon-deductible capital costs for the tax year ended December 31, 2016 include certain transaction costs capitalized in the prior year that are now deductible as a result of the termination of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI.\nForeign subsidiaries of the Company have incurred capital losses of $109 million that are indefinitely available to offset capital gains in those foreign jurisdictions. As the future realization of these carryforwards is not anticipated, a valuation allowance of $28 million was recorded in 2016.\nIn the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million and $62 million,\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nrespectively, which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our respective income tax provisions do not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us and recognized a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK. The earnings in CF Fertilisers UK have been permanently reinvested. Therefore, the recognition of the $94 million million gain on the remeasurement of the historical equity investment does not include the recognition of tax expense on the gain.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP, as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $119 million and $34 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are included in (loss) earnings before income taxes and equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates, impact the effective tax rate in both years. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2016 due to our strategic venture with CHS that commenced on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nSee Note 9-Income Taxes for additional information.\nEquity in Earnings of Non-Operating Affiliates-Net of Taxes\nEquity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities that we account for using the equity method and exclude from operating earnings. Equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes in 2015 included the previously owned 50% equity method earnings of CF Fertilisers UK and also included our share of operating losses experienced at Keytrade. On July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us for total consideration of $570 million, and CF Fertilisers UK became wholly owned by us and part of our consolidated financial results. We recorded a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK in connection with the closing of the acquisition. Equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes on 2015 also included our share of CF Fertilisers UK operating results up to the date of the acquisition. In addition, during the second quarter of 2015, we sold our interests in Keytrade and recorded an after-tax loss of $29 million (pre-tax loss of $40 million).\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $85 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN. This increase is partly offset by lower net earnings attributable to the approximately 24.7% interest of the publicly held common units of TNCLP.\nDiluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nDiluted net (loss) earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased $4.15 to a loss of $1.19 per share in 2016 from diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.96 per share in 2015. This decrease is due to lower net earnings.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nOur reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker, as defined in the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), assesses the performance of our reportable segments and makes decisions about resource allocation. These segments are differentiated by products. Our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Total other operating costs and expenses (consisting of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating-net) and non-operating expenses (interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management.\nThe following table presents summary operating results by business segment:\nTable 159:

Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons. \n (2) Includes CF Fertilisers UK results since July 31, 2015, the date of our acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest not previously owned by us.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales in the ammonia segment increased by $228 million, or 23%, to $1.21 billion in 2017 from $981 million in 2016 due primarily to a 43% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 13% decrease in average selling prices. The increase in sales volume was due to higher production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in December 2016. Average selling prices declined due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. Selling prices strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2017 rising approximately 3% compared to the prior year period.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment averaged $261 per ton in 2017, a 5% increase from $248 per ton in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, in addition to higher depreciation as a result of the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities, partially offset by the start-up costs for those plants in 2016 and production efficiencies realized in 2017 due to increased volume. Depreciation and amortization in our ammonia segment in 2017 was $45 per ton compared to $33 per ton in 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales in the ammonia segment decreased by $542 million, or 36%, to $981 million in 2016 from $1.52 billion in 2015 due primarily to a 33% decrease in average selling prices and a 4% decrease in sales volume. These results include the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased net sales by $26 million, or 2%. The remaining decrease in our ammonia net sales of $568 million, or 37%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices and sales volume. Selling prices declined due to excess global nitrogen supply. In addition, our selling prices reflect the impact of a higher proportion of export sales, the volumes of which increased as a result of the weak fall application season attributable to the combined impact of weather conditions and low crop prices on our customers' decisions related to applying fertilizer in the fall. Sales volume in 2016 declined due to the combination of the weak fall application season and the impact of upgrading additional ammonia production at our Donaldsonville facility into granular urea and UAN as a result of our capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment averaged $248 per ton in 2016, including the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which averaged $220 per ton. The remaining cost of sales per ton was $250 in 2016, a 16% decrease from the $296 per ton in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015 and to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs in 2016. This was partly offset by capacity expansion project start-up costs of $50 million and an increase in expansion project depreciation as a result of the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities.\nGranular Urea Segment\nOur granular urea segment produces granular urea, which contains 46% nitrogen.

concentration specified by the customer. Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales in the UAN segment decreased $62 million, or 5%, to $1.13 billion in 2017 due primarily to an 11% decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 6% increase in sales volume. Average selling prices decreased to $160 per ton in 2017 compared to $179 per ton in 2016. UAN average selling prices were lower due primarily to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. Selling prices strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2017 rising approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. Our sales volume was higher due primarily to growth in our North American customer base and higher export sales.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our UAN segment averaged $149 in 2017, an 8% increase from the average of $138 per ton in 2016.

Depreciation and amortization in our UAN segment in both 2017 and 2016 was $37 per ton.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales in the UAN segment decreased $284 million, or 19%, to $1.20 billion in 2016 due primarily to a 29% decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 14% increase in sales volume. Average selling prices decreased to $179 per ton in 2016 compared to $252 per ton in 2015. UAN selling prices were lower due to excess global nitrogen supply weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. Increases in UAN exports at lower selling prices also negatively impacted our average selling price. Sales volume was higher due to increased production as a result of expanded UAN capacity at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex that came on line in the first quarter of 2016.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our UAN segment averaged $138 in 2016, a 15% decrease from the average of $162 per ton in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015 and the impact of lower realized natural gas cost in 2016. This was partly offset by increased depreciation expense related to the expanded UAN capacity at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex that came on line in the first quarter of 2016.\nAN Segment\nOur AN segment produces ammonium nitrate (AN).

The remaining decrease in our Other segment net sales of $36 million, or 16%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices due to excess global nitrogen supply weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our Other segment averaged $131 in 2016, including the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which averaged $158 per ton. The remaining cost of sales per ton averaged $121 in 2016, an 18% decrease from the $147 per ton in 2015 due to the unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 and the impact of the purchase accounting inventory valuation step-up in 2015 arising out of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, investments, taxes, share repurchases and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business. Generally, our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes cash generated by customer advances. We may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our credit agreements.\nAt December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under the Revolving Credit Agreement and our senior notes.\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $835 million at December 31, 2017, a decline of $329 million from $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016. During 2017, our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events, which are further described below.\n \u2022 Receipt of a federal tax refund of $815 million due to the carryback of certain tax losses primarily arising from our capacity expansion projects \n \u2022 Early redemption and purchase of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes due in 2018 and 2020  Capacity Expansion Project and Receipt of Tax Refund From Tax Loss Carryback\nIn 2016, we completed capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa that were originally announced in 2012. These projects provided us with an increase of approximately 25% in production capacity and had a total capital cost of $5.2 billion. The completion of our capacity expansion projects has reduced what had been a substantial use of liquidity in recent years. See discussion under \"Overview of CF Holdings-Items Affecting Comparability of Results-Depreciation and amortization,\" above, and \"-Capital Spending,\" below, for further information on these projects.\nA significant portion of the capital assets that were constructed as part of the capacity expansion projects qualified for bonus depreciation under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act). Under the provisions of the PATH Act, eligible capital additions are subject to 50% bonus depreciation in the year the asset is placed in service. We generated a substantial federal net operating loss in 2016, primarily as a result of the bonus depreciation deductions. In the second quarter of 2017, we received a federal tax refund of $815 million as a result of the claim to carry back the 2016 federal net operating loss to prior income tax years.\nEarly Redemption and Purchase of Senior Notes\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) at a total purchase price of approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. See discussion under \"Debt-Senior Notes-Senior Secured Notes,\" below, for further information.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less. Under our short-term investment policy, we may invest our cash balances, either directly or through mutual funds, in several types of investment-grade securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations. Securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments; those issued by state, local or other governmental entities; and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCapital Spending\nWe make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base, increase our capacity, improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $473 million in 2017 compared to $2.21 billion in 2016 with the decrease primarily due to completion in 2016 of our capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa. Capital expenditures in 2017 include approximately $110 million of payments to contractors and vendors for work completed on our capacity expansion projects in 2016.\nProjected Capital Spending\nCapital expenditures for new activity in 2018 are estimated to be in the range of $400 to $450 million. Planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, delay in the receipt of equipment, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties.\nPurchase of Publicly Traded Common Units of TNCLP\nOn February 7, 2018, we announced that TNGP elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP. See Note 26-Subsequent Event for additional information.\nGovernment Policies\nThe policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes, duties, tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials, finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world. The policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices, and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers, or farmers. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic, political and social objectives. Additionally, the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity. The impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity.\nEthanol Industry and the Renewable Fuel Standard\nCorn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38% of total U.S. corn demand. U.S. government policy, as expressed in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), is a major determinant for the ethanol market. The RFS establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels, including ethanol, that must be included in the United States' supply of fuel for transportation. In addition, the U.S. Congress, at various times, has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the RFS. While past legislation proposing changes to the RFS has not been enacted into law, there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law. Other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol, gasoline and corn. Lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry, which could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nRepatriation of Foreign Earnings and Income Taxes\nWe have operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and an interest in a joint venture in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Historically, the estimated additional U.S. and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the U.S. were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized, unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans. However, the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation. As a result, the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings, as applicable, and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods.\nIn light of changes made by the Tax Act, commencing with the 2018 tax year, the United States no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the United States, unless such earnings are subject to U.S. rules on passive income or certain anti-abuse provisions. Foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the United States.\nCash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately $152 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of $835 million was held primarily by our Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries. Historically, the cash balance held by the Canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested. As of December 31, 2017, as a result of the amounts accrued in the transition tax liability recorded as a result of the Tax Act, we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the Canadian and United Kingdom cash balances if we were to repatriate this cash in the future.\nDebt\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nWe have a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) providing for a revolving credit facility of up to $750 million with a maturity of September 18, 2020. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of $125 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. CF Industries may designate as borrowers one or more wholly owned subsidiaries that are organized in the United States or any state thereof, or the District of Columbia.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euro and British pounds, and bear interest at a per annum rate equal to an applicable eurocurrency rate or base rate plus, in either case, a specified margin, and the borrowers are required to pay an undrawn commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement and customary letter of credit fees. The specified margin and the amount of the commitment fee depend on CF Holdings' credit rating at the time.\nThe borrowers and guarantors under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which are currently comprised of CF Holdings, CF Industries and CF Holdings' wholly owned subsidiaries CF Industries Enterprises, Inc. (CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS), are referred to together herein as the Loan Parties. CF Holdings and CF Industries guaranteed the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Agreement prior to the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, and, upon the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, CFE and CFS also became guarantors of the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to specified exceptions, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires that each direct or indirect domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings that guarantees debt for borrowed money of any Loan Party in excess of $150 million become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to specified exceptions, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires a grant of a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties, to secure the obligations of the Loan Parties thereunder.\nIn addition to the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Loan Parties also guarantee the obligations under any (i) letter of credit facilities, letter of credit reimbursement agreements, letters of credit, letters of guaranty, surety bonds or similar arrangements in an aggregate amount up to $300 million and (ii) interest rate or other hedging arrangements, in each case between CF Holdings or certain of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any person that is a lender or the administrative agent under the Revolving Credit Agreement or an affiliate of such person, on the other hand, that are designated by CF Industries as Secured Bilateral LC Facilities or Secured Swap Agreements (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement (such additional obligations, the Additional\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nGuaranteed Obligations). Obligations under Secured Bilateral LC Facilities in an aggregate amount up to $300 million and obligations under Secured Swap Agreements are secured by the same security interest that secures the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants customary for a financing of this type. Prior to the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, the Revolving Credit Agreement limited the ability of non-guarantor subsidiaries of CF Holdings to incur indebtedness and limited the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to grant liens, merge or consolidate with other entities and sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity, in each case, subject to specified exceptions. The November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment modified the negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement to limit further the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to grant liens and add limitations on the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to incur debt, pay dividends, voluntarily prepay certain debt, make investments and dispose of assets, in each case, subject to specified exceptions (such further and additional limitations, the Additional Negative Covenants).\nThe financial covenants applicable to CF Holdings and its subsidiaries in the Revolving Credit Agreement (the New Financial Covenants):\n (i) restrict the ratio of total secured debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to a maximum of 3.75:1.00, \n (ii) require the ratio of EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated interest expense (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to be a minimum of 1.20:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending on or prior to December 31, 2018, and 1.50:1.00 thereafter, and \n (iii) require the ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than or equal to 0.60:1.00.  Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, if on any date certain conditions were met, including (i) an absence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement, (ii) the receipt of an investment grade corporate rating for CF Holdings from two of three selected ratings agencies and (iii) the ratio of CF Holdings' total net debt to EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended being less than 3.75:1.00, CF Industries would be able to, at its option, choose to (w) suspend the Additional Negative Covenants, (x) replace the New Financial Covenants with covenants requiring the ratio of total net debt to EBITDA for the period of four fiscal consecutive quarters most recently ended to be less than or equal to 3.75:1.00 and the ratio of EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to be not less than 2.75:1.00, (y) release the collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and (z) release the guarantees supporting, and the collateral securing, the Secured Bilateral LC Facilities and the Secured Swap Agreements. Such a choice by CF Industries would commence a \"Covenant Suspension Period\" that would expire upon the Company's no longer having an investment grade corporate rating from two of three selected rating agencies. Upon the expiration of a Covenant Suspension Period, the Additional Negative Covenants and the New Financial Covenants would be reinstated, and the Loan Parties party to the Revolving Credit Agreement would be required to guarantee the Additional Guaranteed Obligations and grant a first priority security interest in substantially all of each Loan Party's assets, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties, subject to certain exceptions, to secure the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Secured Bilateral LC Facilities and the Secured Swap Agreements.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains events of default (with notice requirements and cure periods, as applicable) customary for a financing of this type, including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal, interest or fees; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; and failure to comply with specified covenants. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and after any applicable cure period, subject to specified exceptions, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite lenders is required to, accelerate the loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement or terminate the lenders' commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had excess borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $695 million (net of outstanding letters of credit of $55 million). There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016, or during 2017. Maximum borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $150 million with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 1.85%.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLetters of Credit\nIn addition to the letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, as described above, we have also entered into a bilateral agreement with capacity to issue letters of credit up to $75 million. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $72 million of letters of credit were outstanding under this agreement.\nSenior Notes\nLong-term debt presented on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consisted of the following Public Senior Notes (unsecured) and Senior Secured Notes issued by CF Industries: Table 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Effective Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Amount (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Amount (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public Senior Notes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.875% due May 2018\n</td> <td>7.344%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.125% due May 2020\n</td> <td>7.529%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.450% due June 2023\n</td> <td>3.562%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.150% due March 2034\n</td> <td>5.279%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.950% due June 2043\n</td> <td>5.031%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.375% due March 2044\n</td> <td>5.465%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Notes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.400% due December 2021\n</td> <td>3.782%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.500% due December 2026\n</td> <td>4.759%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Carrying amount is net of unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs. Total unamortized debt discount was $12 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and total deferred debt issuance costs were $46 million and $60 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  Public Senior Notes\nUnder the indentures (including the applicable supplemental indentures) governing our senior notes due 2018, 2020, 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 (the Public Senior Notes), each series of Public Senior Notes is guaranteed by CF Holdings, and, in connection with the effectiveness of the November 2016 amendment to our Revolving Credit Agreement, CF Holdings' wholly owned subsidiaries CF Industries Enterprises, Inc. (CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS) became subsidiary guarantors of the Public Senior Notes.\nInterest on the Public Senior Notes is payable semiannually, and the Public Senior Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.\nIf a Change of Control occurs together with a Ratings Downgrade (as both terms are defined under the indentures governing the Public Senior Notes), CF Industries would be required to offer to repurchase each series of Public Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, in the event that a subsidiary of CF Holdings, other than CF Industries, becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any renewal, replacement or refinancing thereof), such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the Public Senior Notes, provided that such requirement will no longer apply with respect to the Public Senior Notes due 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 following the repayment of the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020 or the subsidiaries of ours, other than CF Industries, otherwise becoming no longer subject to such a requirement to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020.\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\napproximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes). The aggregate purchase price was approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn November 21, 2016, CF Industries issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.400% senior secured notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Senior Secured Notes). The net proceeds, after deducting discounts and offering expenses, from the issuance and sale of the Senior Secured Notes were approximately $1.23 billion. CF Industries used approximately $1.18 billion of the net proceeds for the prepayment (including payment of a make-whole amount of approximately $170 million and accrued interest) in full of the outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 2022, 2025 and 2027 (Private Senior Notes) issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015.\nInterest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1 beginning on June 1, 2017, and the Senior Secured Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.\nUnder the terms of the applicable indenture, the Senior Secured Notes of each series are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by CF Holdings and each current and future domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) that from time to time is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The requirement for any subsidiary of CF Holdings to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes of a series will apply only until, and the subsidiary guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes of a series will be automatically released upon, the latest to occur of (a) CF Holdings having an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there being no default or event of default under the applicable Indenture, (b) the retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2018 or the subsidiaries of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) otherwise becoming no longer subject to the requirement, described in the second paragraph under \"-Public Senior Notes,\" above, to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and (c) the retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2020 or the subsidiaries of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) otherwise becoming no longer subject to the requirement, described in the second paragraph under \"-Public Senior Notes,\" above, to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2020. In accordance with the applicable indenture, CFE and CFS, in addition to CF Holdings, guaranteed the Senior Secured Notes of each series upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the obligations under each series of Senior Secured Notes and each guarantor's related guarantee are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of CF Industries, CF Holdings and the subsidiary guarantors, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties (the Collateral). The obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, together with certain letter of credit, hedging and similar obligations and future pari passu secured indebtedness, will be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes. The liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes of a series and the related guarantees will be automatically released and the covenant under the applicable indenture limiting dispositions of Collateral will no longer apply if, on any date after the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, CF Holdings has an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there is no default or event of default under the applicable indenture.\nUnder each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, specified changes of control involving CF Holdings or CF Industries, when accompanied by a ratings downgrade, as defined with respect to the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes, constitute change of control repurchase events. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to the 2021 Notes or the 2026 Notes, as applicable, unless CF Industries has exercised its option to redeem such Senior Secured Notes, CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, to incur liens on certain assets to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, to sell or transfer Collateral, to merge or consolidate with other entities and to sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity. Each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest on the applicable Senior Secured Notes; failure to comply with other covenants or agreements under the indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; the failure of CF Holdings' or certain subsidiaries' guarantees of the applicable Senior Secured Notes to be enforceable; lack of validity or perfection of any lien\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nsecuring the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees with respect to Collateral having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than a specified amount; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Under each indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of an event of default arising from one of the specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the applicable Senior Secured Notes would become due and payable immediately, and, in the case of any other event of default (other than an event of default related to CF Industries' and CF Holdings' reporting obligations), the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable Senior Secured Notes then outstanding may declare all of such Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.\nPrivate Senior Notes\nThe senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes), issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015, were governed by the terms of a note purchase agreement (as amended, including by an amendment effective September 7, 2016, the Note Purchase Agreement). The Private Senior Notes were guaranteed by CF Holdings. All obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement were unsecured.\nOn November 21, 2016, we prepaid in full the outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our Private Senior Notes. The prepayment of $1.18 billion included the payment of a make-whole amount of approximately $170 million and accrued interest. Loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million on our consolidated statements of operations excludes $3 million of the make-whole payment, which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nBridge Credit Agreement\nOn September 18, 2015, in connection with our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, CF Holdings and CF Industries entered into a senior unsecured 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders' commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically. There were no borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. See Note 12-Interest Expense for additional information.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nOur Board of Directors (the Board) authorized certain programs to repurchase shares of our common stock. Each of these programs permitted repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market, through privately-negotiated transactions, through block transactions or otherwise. Our management determined the manner, timing and amount of repurchases based on the evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors. On August 6, 2014, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $1 billion of the common stock of CF Holdings through December 31, 2016 (the 2014 Program). As of December 31, 2016, 15.9 million shares had been repurchased for an aggregate expenditure of $900 million. The remaining $100 million of share repurchase authorization under the 2014 Program expired on December 31, 2016. No share repurchase programs were authorized by the Board in 2017.\nForward Sales and Customer Advances\nWe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. Therefore, our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment.\nCustomer advances, which typically represent a portion of the contract's sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $89 million and $42 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWhile customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity, the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers' outlook of future market fundamentals. During periods of declining prices, such as the current environment, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices. If the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Additionally, borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nUnder our forward sales programs, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. These delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us. Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer's inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales.\nNatural Gas Prices\nNatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN and other nitrogen products. Expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs. For example, natural gas costs, including realized gains and losses, comprised approximately 47% of our total production costs in 2017. As a result, natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity.\nBecause most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations, natural gas prices in North America have declined since 2008, but are subject to volatility. During 2017, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in North America, reached a low of $2.44 per MMBtu on February 28, 2017 and a high of $3.65 per MMBtu on three consecutive days in January 2017. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub reached a low of $1.49 per MMBtu on three consecutive days in March 2016 and a high of $3.77 per MMBtu on December 8, 2016.\nWe also have manufacturing facilities located in the United Kingdom. These facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in Europe. The major natural gas trading point for the United Kingdom is the National Balancing Point (NBP). During 2017, the daily closing price at NBP reached a low of $3.30 per MMBtu on June 15, 2017 and a high of $9.00 per MMBtu on December 12, 2017. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, the daily closing price at NBP reached a low of $2.80 per MMBtu on September 1, September 12 and September 14, 2016, and a high of $9.00 per MMBtu on December 12, 2017.\nNatural gas costs in our cost of sales, including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, increased 11% per MMBtu in 2017 from 2016.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based fertilizers. From time to time, we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Because we use derivative instruments, volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the value of the derivatives. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market losses (gains) on natural gas derivatives of $61 million, $(260) million and $176 million, respectively, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. We control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks, other major financial institutions or large energy companies, and, in most cases, the use of International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting arrangements. The ISDA agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement.\nThe ISDA agreements to most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade, our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. The Revolving Credit Agreement, at any time when it is secured, provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to, or affiliates of parties to, the Revolving Credit Agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives. In the event the Revolving Credit Agreement becomes unsecured, separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was $12 million and zero, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the credit-\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nrisk-related contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 35.9 million MMBtus and 183.0 million MMBtus, respectively. At both December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts.\nEmbedded Derivative Liability\nUnder the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of $5 million to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026.\nThis obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as an embedded derivative and its value is included in other liabilities. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe contributed $82 million to our pension plans in 2017. The contributions in 2017 include a voluntary contribution of $59 million made in the second quarter of 2017. We expect to contribute approximately $41 million to our pension plans in 2018.\nDistributions on Noncontrolling Interest in CFN\nThe CFN Board of Managers approved semi-annual distribution payments during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, in accordance with the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of CFN, as follows: Table 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Approved and paid\n</td> <td>Distribution Period\n</td> <td>Distribution Amount\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter of 2018\n</td> <td>Six months ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter of 2017\n</td> <td>Six months ended June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter of 2017\n</td> <td>Six months ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter of 2016\n</td> <td>February 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $1.63 billion as compared to $617 million in 2016, an increase of $1,014 million. The increase was primarily due to working capital changes including the receipt of our $815 million income tax refund related to the claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior income tax years. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also a result of entering 2017 with a lower level of customer advances than 2016 due to customer reluctance to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment. These increases were partially offset by higher contributions to our pension plans. In 2017, we contributed $82 million to our pension plans compared to $23 million in 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $617 million as compared to $1.21 billion in 2015, a decline of $590 million. The decline resulted primarily from lower net earnings during 2016 due to lower selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply, partially offset by lower amounts of cash used for working capital purposes. Lower working capital levels in accounts receivable and inventory, plus lower amounts paid for income taxes and certain income tax refunds received in 2016, contributed to the reduction in cash used for working capital. Favorable changes in working capital also included a greater proportion of sales paid in 2016 as compared to the prior year period as we entered 2016 with a lower level of customer advances than in 2015 due to customers' hesitancy to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $408 million in 2017 compared to $2.18 billion in 2016. This $1.77 billion decrease is due primarily to lower capital expenditures as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa at the end of 2016. During 2017, capital expenditures totaled $473 million compared to $2.21 billion in 2016. The $2.98 billion net cash used in investing activities in 2015 included $2.47 billion in capital expenditures and the 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us for a net cash payment of $552 million, which was net of cash acquired of $18 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.56 billion in 2017 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.44 billion in 2016 and $77 million in 2015. In 2017, we paid $1.15 billion in connection with the early redemption of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2018 Notes, the purchase of approximately $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes pursuant to a tender offer and premiums paid for the early retirement of long-term debt. In 2016, CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for $2.8 billion. In 2017 and 2016, we distributed $131 million and $119 million, respectively, to the noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP. In 2015, we distributed $45 million to the noncontrolling interest in TNCLP. The increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the CHS strategic venture, which increased the distributions by $79 million, representing the distributions paid to CHS in the third quarter of 2016 for the distribution period ended June 30, 2016.\nIn 2016, we received proceeds of approximately $1.24 billion, net of discounts, from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes which were used to fund the prepayment of the $1.0 billion of Private Senior Notes and the related make-whole payment of $170 million. In 2015, we issued the Private Senior Notes and received proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. No share repurchases were made during 2017 and 2016 compared to cash used for share repurchases in 2015 of $556 million.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment purchases and plant improvements\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation(2)\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(3)(4)\n</td> <td>661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions to pension plans(5)\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(6)(7)(8)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Based on debt balances before discounts, offering expenses and interest rates as of December 31, 2017. \n (2) Includes anticipated expenditures under certain contracts to transport finished product to and from our facilities. The majority of these arrangements allow for reductions in usage based on our actual operating rates. Amounts set forth in this table are based on projected normal operating rates and contracted or current spot prices, where applicable, as of December 31, 2017 and actual operating rates and prices may differ. \n (3) Includes minimum commitments to purchase and transport natural gas based on prevailing market-based forward prices as of December 31, 2017 excluding reductions for plant maintenance and turnaround activities. Purchase obligations do not include any amounts related to our natural gas derivatives. See Note 14-Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. \n (4) Includes a commitment to purchase ammonia from PLNL at market-based prices under an agreement that expires in September 2018. The purchase commitment is $73 million based on market prices as of December 31, 2017. This agreement includes automatic consecutive one-year renewals, unless otherwise terminated by either party in advance. Assuming the agreement is not terminated by either party and based on market prices as of December 31, 2017, the annual commitment would be $97 million. \n (5) Represents the contributions we expect to make to our pension plans during 2018. Our pension funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum legal funding requirements plus discretionary amounts that we may deem to be appropriate. \n (6) Excludes $151 million of unrecognized tax benefits, due to the uncertainty in the timing of potential tax payments, and the estimated transition tax liability of $57 million resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 9-Income Taxes for additional information. \n (7) Excludes $15 million of environmental remediation liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of payments. \n (8) Excludes $5 million annual payments to CHS related to our embedded derivative due to uncertainty of future credit ratings, as this is only applicable until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026. See Note 8-Fair Value Measurements or Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.  On April 2, 2018, TNGP will purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP for approximately $390 million in the aggregate. See Note 26-Subsequent Event for additional information.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of our products. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to eleven years and the barge charter commitments range from one to seven years. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one to five years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party. See Note 23-Leases for additional information.\nWe do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, rebates, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize expenses, assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. U.S. income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. We adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.\nHistorically, a deferred income tax liability was recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture that were considered to not be permanently reinvested. No deferred income tax liability was recorded for the remainder of our investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture, which we believed to be permanently reinvested. In light of changes made by the Tax Act, the Company is evaluating whether it will continue to treat foreign subsidiary earnings as being permanently reinvested.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nAs a large commercial enterprise with international operations, our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors. The most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation in the countries in which we operate, changes in the geographic mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses, and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint venture that could be subjected to U.S. taxation. It is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense, net income and liquidity in future periods.\nWe operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions. The taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe, including the countries in which we operate. The tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries. As a result, there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances. We work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions. However, there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical. As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of $151 million, which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions. This amount represents our best estimate of the potential amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions. Differences in interpretation of the tax laws, including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions, can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nWe review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with U.S. GAAP in order to assess recoverability. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, selling prices, raw material costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process. The recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Adverse changes in demand for our products, increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review.\nThe recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value, and the reduction in value is other than temporary, the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings.\nPLNL is our joint venture investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the NGC pursuant to the NGC Contract. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which have reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. The NGC Contract had an initial expiration date of September 2018 and has been extended on the same terms until September 2023. Any NGC commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price. PLNL and NGC are currently parties to arbitration proceedings where the main issue remaining in dispute is PLNL's claims for damages for past and ongoing curtailments.\nAlthough the joint venture believes its claims against NGC to be meritorious, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration. There are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture, beyond 2023, that are uncertain at this time, including the quantities of gas NGC will make available, the cost of such gas, the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing. As part of our 2016 impairment assessment of our equity method investment in PLNL, we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a $134 million impairment charge. Previously, in 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $62 million related to our equity method investment in PLNL. The carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL at December 31, 2017 is $108 million. If NGC does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to PLNL at prices that permit profitable operations, PLNL may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in PLNL.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. Our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value. If after performing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further testing is performed. However, if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test, we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, if needed, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. We identified no goodwill impairment in our 2017, 2016 or 2015 reviews. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.37 billion and $2.35 billion, respectively.\nIntangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of Terra Industries Inc. consist of customer relationships, which are being amortized over a period of 18 years. The intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of CF Fertilisers UK consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a period of approximately 20 years. Our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nPension Assets and Liabilities\nPension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation (PBO) are discount rates and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, an adjusted retail price index (RPI). Key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on assets (EROA) and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, RPI.\nThe December 31, 2017 PBO was computed based on a weighted-average discount rate of 3.6% for our North America plans and 2.5% for our United Kingdom plans, which were based on yields for high-quality (AA rated or better) fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of December 31. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. The weighted-average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2017 was 4.0% for North America plans and 2.8% for United Kingdom plans. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The 4.2% weighted-average EROA used to calculate pension expense in 2017 for our North America plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. The 4.6% weighted-average EROA used to calculate pension expense in 2017 for our United Kingdom plans is based on expected long-term performance of underlying investments. The EROA for both North America and United Kingdom plans are adjusted for expenses and diversification bonuses. The 3.2% RPI used to calculate our United Kingdom plan PBO and the 3.3% RPI used to calculate 2017 pension expense is developed using the Bank of England implied retail price inflation curve, which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and index-linked government bonds.\nFor North America qualified pension plans, our PBO was $805 million as of December 31, 2017, which was $67 million higher than pension plan assets. For our United Kingdom pension plans, our PBO was $590 million as of December 31, 2017 which was $176 million higher than pension plan assets. The tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our December 31, 2017 PBO and 2017 pension expense:\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>North America Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017 PBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Pension Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumption\n</td> <td>+50 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-50 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+50 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-50 bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EROA\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>United Kingdom Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017 PBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Pension Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumption\n</td> <td>+50 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-50 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>+50 bps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-50 bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EROA\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RPI\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for further discussion of our pension plans.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3-New Accounting Standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.

Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users. Our principal nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). Our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers, and compound fertilizer products (NPKs), which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. We operate world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, and distribute plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States. We also export nitrogen fertilizer products from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Yazoo City, Mississippi manufacturing facilities, and our United Kingdom manufacturing facilities in Billingham and Ince.\nOur principal assets include:\n \u2022 four U.S. nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in the world); Port Neal, Iowa; Yazoo City, Mississippi; and Woodward, Oklahoma. These facilities are owned by CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), of which we own approximately 89% and CHS Inc. (CHS) owns the remainder. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS; \n \u2022 an approximately 75.3% interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly traded limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and the majority limited partner and which, through its subsidiary Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP), operates a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma; \n \u2022 two Canadian nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, located in Medicine Hat, Alberta (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada) and Courtright, Ontario; \n \u2022 two United Kingdom nitrogen manufacturing complexes, located in Billingham and Ince; \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n \u2022 an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States; and \n \u2022 a 50% interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago that we account for under the equity method.  On February 7, 2018, we announced that Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP), the sole general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement. The purchase price of $84.033 per unit was determined under the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement as the average of the daily closing prices per common unit for the 20 consecutive trading days beginning with January 5, 2018 and ending with February 2, 2018. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. We intend to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018 purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP, and the common units representing limited partner interests will cease to be publicly traded or listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nIndustry Factors\nWe operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below.\nGlobal Supply and Demand Factors\nOur products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand and different cost factors.\nHistorically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, gross domestic product growth, changes in dietary habits, planted acreage, and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short-term fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, governmental regulations, including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of bio-fuels or industrial nitrogen products and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key exporting/consuming countries such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, among others, often play a major role in shaping near-term market fundamentals. The economics of nitrogen-based fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade. Raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal; supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities.\nOver the last decade, strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities, which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity. As a result, global nitrogen fertilizer capacity increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating a surplus of global nitrogen capacity in the market, and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. In addition, global feedstock commodity prices declined, including coal and oil-linked gas, contributing to the lower nitrogen fertilizer prices.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nGlobal Trade in Fertilizer\nIn addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values, the availability of credit and governmental trade policies. The development of additional natural gas reserves in North America over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world, making North American nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive. These lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in North America, including our capacity expansion projects in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa, which were completed in December 2016. Changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world.\nImports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers located in the Middle East, Ukraine, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, North Africa, Russia and China have been major exporters to North America.\nFarmers' Economics\nThe demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns, crop prices and the types of crops planted.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Results\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\" or \"Tax Reform\") which includes a number of changes to U.S. tax law that affect us. As a result of the Tax Act we recognized a $491 million income tax benefit, which has a significant impact on our 2017 financial results. This impact generally results from the following two major provisions:\n \u2022 Impact of Tax Rate Change on Deferred Tax Liabilities - The most significant impact of Tax Reform is the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This change necessitates the revaluation of all of our U.S. deferred tax balances which resulted in an income tax benefit of $552 million that was recorded in 2017. \n \u2022 Transition Tax (Repatriation Tax) on Foreign Earnings and Profits - Tax Reform requires us to pay U.S. tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. Foreign earnings held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at a 15.5% rate, and the remaining earnings are taxed at an 8% rate. We intend to elect to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period and have recognized a tax charge and liability of $57 million in 2017 for this item.  Nitrogen Fertilizer Selling Prices\nA significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016 and 2017, including an increase in production capacity located in North America, which has further increased supply. Additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2018. As a result, we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.\nThe U.S. Gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there. Through most of 2016, nitrogen pricing at the U.S. Gulf declined, often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to continued imports from various exporting regions and delayed North American buyer interest as a result of greater global nitrogen supply availability. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multi-year lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of 2016. Early in the first quarter of 2017, prices began to increase as the supply and demand balance tightened in anticipation of spring fertilizer demand for the planting and growing season. However, as the first quarter progressed, increased imports into North America increased fertilizer supply in the region, which pressured selling prices downward as the quarter ended. During the second quarter of 2017, excess supply through imports into the United States that occurred in the first quarter of 2017 continued in the second quarter, negatively impacting selling prices. During the third quarter of 2017, prices hit yearly lows and then selling prices for most nitrogen products increased throughout the quarter, ending higher than at the beginning of the quarter, driven by significantly lower Chinese exports, higher energy and production costs in parts of the world, a weaker U.S. dollar and strong global demand. During the fourth quarter of 2017, certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur, were delayed, and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing.\nThe significant price fluctuations we have experienced in 2017 are symptoms of a market in transition as new capacity comes on line and global trade flows adjust, and this transition is not complete. We expect the final set of North American capacity additions to come fully on line by mid-2018. Should imports of nitrogen products into North America continue at high rates, the oversupply in the region will continue, which could lead to lower prices, similar to those experienced in early 2017. New global nitrogen capacity additions coming on line after 2018 are expected to be lower than recent years, which will support the market transition or more balanced supply and demand.\nThe greater global nitrogen supply availability and resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices significantly impacted our results. The average selling price for our products for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $207 per ton, $217 per ton and $314 per ton, respectively. The decline in average selling prices from 2016 to 2017 reduced net sales by $293 million, while the decline in average selling prices from 2015 to 2016 reduced net sales by $1.4 billion. In addition to the direct impact of lower selling prices, during periods of declining prices, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, certain significant items impacted our financial results. The following table and related discussion outline these significant items and how they impacted the comparability of our financial results during these periods. Positive amounts in the table below are costs or expenses incurred, while negative amounts are income recognized in the periods presented.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) The tax impact is calculated utilizing a marginal effective rate of 36.8% in 2017 and 37.2% in both 2016 and 2015.\n(2) Included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(3) Included primarily in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(4) Included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(5) Included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(6) Included in equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(7) Included in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(8) Included primarily in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(9) Included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(10) Included in equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates (in 2017) and in equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates (in 2015) in our consolidated statements of operations.  \nThe following describes the significant items that impacted the comparability of our financial results in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Descriptions of items below that refer to amounts in the table above, refer to the pre-tax amounts.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDepreciation and amortization\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense recognized in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $883 million, $678 million and $480 million, respectively. This increase in depreciation expense reflects the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing in service all five of the new plants prior to the end of 2016. The capacity expansion projects were originally announced in 2012 and included the construction of new ammonia, urea, and UAN plants at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal, Iowa complex. These plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25%, improved our product mix flexibility at Donaldsonville, and improved our ability to serve upper-Midwest urea customers from our Port Neal location. The following table indicates the quarter in which each of the five expansion plants were placed in service.\n\nDepreciation expense pertaining to each of our capacity expansion plants commenced once the applicable plant was placed in service.\nUnrealized net mark-to-market loss (gain) on natural gas derivatives\nNatural gas is typically the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. This can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market losses (gains) on natural gas derivatives of $61 million, $(260) million and $176 million, respectively.\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans\nIn 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized losses (gains) of $2 million, $93 million and $(8) million, respectively, from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily British pound and Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested.\nEquity method investment tax contingency accrual\nThe Trinidad tax authority (the Board of Inland Revenue) has issued a tax assessment against our equity method investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, PLNL, related to a dispute over whether tax depreciation must be claimed during a tax holiday period that was granted to PLNL under the Trinidad Fiscal Incentives Act. The tax holiday was granted as an incentive to construct PLNL's ammonia plant. Based on the facts and circumstances of this matter, PLNL recorded a tax contingency accrual, which reduced our equity in earnings of PLNL for 2017 by approximately $7 million reflecting our 50% ownership interest. In early 2018, PLNL settled this matter with the Board of Inland Revenue for the amounts accrued.\nStrategic venture with CHS\nWe commenced a strategic venture with CHS on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for $2.8 billion. CHS also began receiving deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to approximately 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its minority equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. The amounts of distributions from CFN to us and CHS are based generally on the profitability of CFN and determined based on the volume of granular urea and UAN sold by CFN to us and CHS pursuant to supply agreements, less a formula driven amount based primarily on the cost of natural gas used to produce the granular urea and UAN, and adjusted for the allocation of items such as operational efficiencies and overhead amounts.\nWe began recognizing the noncontrolling interest pertaining to CHS' ownership interest in CFN on February 1, 2016. During 2017 and 2016, we recognized earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN of $73 million and\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n$93 million, respectively. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information regarding our strategic venture with CHS.\nUnder the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of $5 million to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026. This obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative. During 2017 and 2016, included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations is a net loss of $4 million and $23 million, respectively.\nDebt activity\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) pursuant to a tender offer. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we took certain steps with respect to the Revolving Credit Agreement and our senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes). On November 21, 2016, we prepaid the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Private Senior Notes, and paid the related make-whole amount of approximately $170 million. We made the prepayment and make-whole payment using the proceeds from an offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2021 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2026 (collectively referred to as the Senior Secured Notes\u201d). We recognized $167 million of the $170 million cash make-whole payment on the Private Senior Notes as a loss on debt extinguishment, with the $3 million remainder being a debt modification cost that is being amortized over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nIn connection with the completion of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes in November 2016, certain amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement became effective. The amendments included, among other things, changes in and additions to the financial and other covenants and a reduction in the size of the facility from $1.5 billion to $750 million.\nIn conjunction with our debt restructuring, including amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement, we recognized $18 million of debt issuance and amendment fees in 2016. See further discussion under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 11-Financing Agreements for additional information.\nCapacity expansion projects\nOur capacity expansion projects were completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Capacity expansion project expenses in 2016 and 2015 of $73 million and $51 million, respectively, are included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations and generally consisted of administrative costs and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization.\nStart-up costs of $52 million, which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the ammonia plants, were incurred in 2016 and are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Losses on foreign currency derivatives of $22 million in 2015 are included in other operating-net in our consolidated statements of operations and relate to hedges of European euro denominated equipment purchased as part of the capacity expansion projects.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nTransaction costs and termination of agreement with OCI\nOn August 6, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the Combination Agreement) to combine with the European, North American and global distribution businesses of OCI N.V. (OCI). On May 22, 2016, CF Holdings, OCI and the other parties to the Combination Agreement entered into a termination agreement (the Termination Agreement) under which the parties agreed to terminate the Combination Agreement by mutual written consent. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, CF Holdings paid OCI a termination fee of $150 million. Under the Termination Agreement, the parties to the Combination Agreement also agreed to release each other from any and all claims, actions, obligations, liabilities, expenses and fees in connection with, arising out of or related to the Combination Agreement and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby (other than the confidentiality agreement between CF Holdings and OCI) or the transactions contemplated therein or thereby.\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI and our strategic venture with CHS. This includes the $150 million termination fee paid to OCI in the second quarter of 2016, which is described above, and costs for various consulting and legal services. In 2015, we incurred $57 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, our strategic venture with CHS, and the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nOn September 18, 2015, in connection with our proposed combination with OCI, we entered into a senior unsecured 364-day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders' commitment under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically and we recognized $28 million in bridge loan commitment fees. In 2015, we recognized $6 million of fees related to the initiation of the bridge loan.\nCF Fertilisers UK acquisition\nOn July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us for total consideration of $570 million, and CF Fertilisers UK became a wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the acquisition, we recognized a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity investment in CF Fertilisers UK. CF Fertilisers UK Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Limited), a wholly owned subsidiary of CF Fertilisers UK, operates two nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United Kingdom, in the cities of Ince and Billingham. This transaction increased our manufacturing capacity with the acquisition of CF Fertilisers UK's nitrogen manufacturing complexes. The Ince complex is located in northwestern England and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, an AN plant and three NPK plants. The Billingham complex is located in the Teesside chemical area in northeastern England, and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, a carbon dioxide plant and an AN fertilizer plant.\nEquity method investments\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a gain of $14 million related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility. During 2015, we recognized a loss of $43 million related to the sale of our 50% investment in Keytrade AG and the sale of our 50% investment in an ammonia storage joint venture in Houston, Texas.\nOur equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, includes an impairment charge of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million and $62 million, respectively. PLNL is our joint venture investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) pursuant to a gas sales contract (the NGC Contract). PLNL had experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below, for additional information.\nSee Note 7-Equity Method Investments for additional information regarding our equity method investments.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nFinancial Executive Summary\nNet earnings (loss)\nWe reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $358 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $277 million in 2016, or an increase in net earnings between the periods of $635 million. Tax Reform had a significant impact on our reported results in 2017 as we recognized $491 million of income in our tax provision related to the enactment of Tax Reform in the United States. Further information regarding the impact of Tax Reform can be found above under \"Items Affecting Comparability of Results-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\" Diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders was $1.53 in 2017 compared to diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $1.19 in 2016, or an increase of $2.72 per share. The impact of Tax Reform added $2.10 to diluted earnings per share in 2017.\n(Loss) earnings before income taxes\nEarnings before income taxes increased by $101 million to a loss of $125 million in 2017 from a loss of $226 million in 2016. The increase in earnings before income taxes is due to a combination of the following three categories of items which are described below:\n \u2022 $617 million of charges that were recognized in 2016 that did not reoccur in 2017; partially offset by \n \u2022 $410 million reduction in gross margin from operations; and \n \u2022 $108 million increase in net interest expense.  Significant charges in 2016\nIn 2016, we recognized $617 million of certain significant charges from the following items:\n \u2022 Transaction costs of $179 million pertaining to our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI (that was ultimately terminated in 2016) and costs associated with establishing our strategic venture with CHS. \n \u2022 An impairment charge of $134 million related to our investment in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited. \n \u2022 We took actions in both 2016 and 2017 to make modifications to our outstanding debt in response to changes in market conditions. Losses on debt extinguishments declined by $114 million as 2016 had losses of $167 million and 2017 had losses of $53 million. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses declined by $190 million in 2017 from an expense of $208 million in 2016 to an expense of $18 million in 2017. Other operating expenses are primarily pertaining to losses on foreign currency exchange rate impacts of the British pound and Canadian dollar on certain intercompany loans, certain costs pertaining to our capacity expansion projects and fair value adjustments for a derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS.  Gross margin from operations in 2017\nAs discussed earlier in \"Overview of CF Holdings-Industry Factors and Items Affecting Comparability of Results,\" our operating results continue to be impacted by a surplus of capacity in the nitrogen industry, which has impacted product selling prices. Industry pricing conditions in 2017 declined early in the year to multi-year lows as oversupply conditions persisted, but selling prices rose as the year ended when supply and demand conditions were more in balance due to delays in the start-up of certain new industry capacity and stronger demand in certain regions. Our results in 2017 also included the full impact of all of our new capacity expansion plants. As a result, we set both production and sales volume records in 2017.\nOur gross margin declined by $410 million in 2017 to $430 million from $840 million in 2016. The following major factors contributed to the decline in gross margin:\n \u2022 a higher unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives, which decreased gross margin by $321 million as 2017 included a $61 million loss and 2016 included a $260 million gain, \n \u2022 a decrease in average selling prices of 5%, which reduced gross margin by $293 million, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In 2017, the average selling prices for ammonia, UAN and granular urea declined by 13%, 11%, and 3%, respectively, while the average selling price for AN increased by 10%, \n \u2022 an increase in physical natural gas costs in 2017, partially offset by the impact of natural gas derivatives that settled in the period, which decreased gross margin by $162 million as compared to 2016, and \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n \u2022 the impact of an increase in depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact from higher sales volume, of $160 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to the completion and start-up of our capacity expansion projects, \n \u2022 partially offset by an increase in sales volume of 18%, which increased gross margin by $275 million, primarily driven by an increase in sales volume for ammonia and granular urea of 43% and 21%, respectively, \n \u2022 targeted cost reduction initiatives and production efficiencies due to increased volume, and \n \u2022 start-up costs of $52 million in 2016 for the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities.  Interest expense-net\nNet interest expense increased by $108 million to $303 million in 2017 from $195 million in 2016. The increase is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects in 2016.\nCash Position\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $835 million at December 31, 2017, a decline of $329 million from $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016. During 2017, our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events, which are further described in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\n \u2022 Receipt of a federal tax refund of $815 million due to the carryback of certain tax losses primarily arising from our capacity expansion projects \n \u2022 Early redemption and purchase of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes due in 2018 and 2020 \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nResults of Consolidated Operations\nThe following table presents our consolidated results of operations and supplemental data: \n______________________________________________________________________________\nN/M-Not Meaningful\n (1) Includes the cost of natural gas that is included in cost of sales during the period under the first-in, first-out inventory cost method. \n (2) Includes realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives settled during the period. Excludes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on natural gas derivatives. \n (3) Amount represents average daily market price for the full year. \n (4) Gross ammonia production, including amounts subsequently upgraded on-site into granular urea, UAN, or AN. \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales\nOur net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize. The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.\nOur total net sales increased $445 million, or 12%, to $4.13 billion in 2017 compared to $3.69 billion in 2016 due to an 18% increase in sales volume, which increased net sales by $738 million, partially offset by a 5% decrease in average selling prices, which reduced net sales by $293 million.\nAverage selling prices were $207 per ton in 2017 compared to $217 per ton in 2016 due primarily to lower ammonia, UAN and granular urea average selling prices in 2017. Selling prices were negatively impacted by greater supply availability which continues to pressure selling prices globally. During the fourth quarter of 2017, certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur, were delayed, and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing.\nThe increase in total sales volume of 18% was due primarily to higher ammonia and granular urea sales volumes, driven by increased production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in December 2016.\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, purchased product costs, and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments, maintenance, direct labor, depreciation and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers.\nOur cost of sales increased $855 million, or 30%, from 2016 to 2017. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, higher unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives and higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, in addition to higher depreciation expense related to the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service. These increases to cost of sales were partially offset by targeted cost reduction initiatives, production efficiencies due to increased volume in 2017 and the absence of start-up costs of the new ammonia plant at our Donaldsonville facility and the new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal facility that occurred in 2016. The cost of sales per ton averaged $185 in 2017, a 10% increase from $168 per ton in 2016. Cost of sales includes a $61 million unrealized net mark-to-market loss in 2017 compared to a $260 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain in 2016. Additionally, realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, increased 11% from $3.07 per MMBtu in 2016 to $3.40 in 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payroll-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees, including those for corporate initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $18 million to $192 million in 2017 from $174 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to the combination of certain corporate office initiatives and higher incentive compensation due to improvements in operating performance.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs consist of various consulting and legal services associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI that was terminated on May 22, 2016; our strategic venture with CHS, which began on February 1, 2016; and our July 31, 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs, including the $150 million termination fee paid to OCI in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the Combination Agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOther Operating-Net\nOther operating-net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations and costs associated with our capacity expansion projects. Costs included in \"other costs\" can include foreign exchange gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives, costs associated with our closed facilities, amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.\nOther operating-net was $18 million of expense in 2017 compared to $208 million of expense in 2016. The decreased expense was due primarily to a $93 million loss in 2016 from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily British pound and Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested. Due to a restructuring of certain intercompany loans, we did not incur the same level of foreign exchange rate impacts in 2017. The decreased expense is also due to expansion project expenses in 2016 of $73 million, generally consisting of administrative and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization, and a $23 million charge representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 8-Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Operating Affiliates\nEquity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates primarily consists of our 50% ownership interest in PLNL. We include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in PLNL as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities. Our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition. In 2016, equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates also includes impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates was $9 million of earnings in 2017 compared to $145 million of losses in 2016. Earnings in 2017 includes a gain of $14 million related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a $134 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL. For additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL, see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,\" below, and Note 7-Equity Method Investments.\nInterest Expense-Net\nOur interest expense-net includes the interest expense on our long-term debt, amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees pursuant to our Revolving Credit Agreement. Capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs. Our interest expense-net also includes interest income, which represents amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nNet interest expense increased by $108 million to $303 million in 2017 from $195 million in 2015. The $108 million increase was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects. In 2016, capitalized interest was $166 million compared to $2 million in 2017. Net interest expense in 2016 also includes the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of $28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Upon the termination of the proposed combination with OCI, the unamortized portion of these fees was expensed.\nDuring 2016, due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we modified the Revolving Credit Agreement by reducing its size from $2.0 billion to $750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms. As a result of these changes, we recognized $16 million of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense in 2016.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLoss on debt extinguishment of $53 million in 2017 primarily consists of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. Loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million in 2016 consists of the make-whole payment, which resulted from our November 21, 2016 prepayment of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million excludes $3 million (of the $170 million make-whole payment), which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Provision\nOur income tax benefit for 2017 was $575 million on a pre-tax loss of $125 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $68 million on a pre-tax loss of $226 million in the prior year. The higher income tax benefit in 2017 is due primarily to the impact of the Tax Act, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $491 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe primary impact of the Tax Act is the revaluation of all of our U.S. deferred tax balances, as result of the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $552 million that was recorded in 2017. This income tax benefit was partially offset by a tax charge and liability of $57 million, which represents our best estimate of the transition tax, or repatriation tax, on foreign earnings and profits, as described above under \"Items Affecting Comparability-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\"\nIn addition, in both years, our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP, as our consolidated income tax (benefit) provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $92 million and $119 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are included in our pre-tax loss, impact the effective tax rate in both years. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nDue primarily to the $491 million income tax benefit from the Tax Act, we recognized a $575 million income tax benefit in 2017 on a pre-tax loss of $125 million. Our effective tax rate in 2017, exclusive of the tax benefit from the Tax Act and exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $92 million from our pre-tax loss, results in an effective tax rate of 38.8%. Our effective tax rate in 2016, exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $119 million from our pre-tax income, resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.6%.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million, which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our 2016 income tax provision does not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction, which reduced our 2016 effective tax rate.\nBoth 2017 and 2016 were impacted by additional discrete tax items. See Note 9-Income Taxes for additional information.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the net earnings attributable to the 24.7% interest of the publicly-held common units of TNCLP. We own approximately 75.3% of TNCLP and outside investors own the remaining 24.7%. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11% CHS minority equity interest in CFN, a subsidiary of CF Holdings, purchased for $2.8 billion on February 1, 2016.\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $27 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to lower earnings from both CFN and TNCLP as both were impacted by lower average selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. The earnings of CFN were also impacted by higher natural gas prices and the impact of higher depreciation as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service.\nDiluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nDiluted net earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders, including the impact of Tax Reform, increased $2.72 to earnings of $1.53 per share in 2017 from a loss of $1.19 per share in 2016. This increase is due primarily to the impact of Tax Reform partially offset by lower gross margin primarily driven by an increase in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, the impact of lower selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability, higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, and higher depreciation expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales\nOur total net sales decreased $623 million, or 14%, to $3.69 billion in 2016 compared to $4.31 billion in 2015. The impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition increased our net sales by $269 million, or 6%. The remaining decline in our net sales of $892 million, or 21%, was due to a 31% decline in average selling prices partially offset by a 14% increase in sales volume.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nAverage selling prices, excluding the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition impact, were $218 per ton in 2016 compared to $318 per ton in 2015 due primarily to lower selling prices across all products. Selling prices were negatively impacted by excess global nitrogen supply. Pricing for nitrogen fertilizer products in the U.S. Gulf declined during most of 2016, often trading below parity with other international pricing points, as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multi-year lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of the year.\nOur total sales volume increased by 24% from 2015 to 2016. The impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition increased our sales volume by 10%. The remaining increase in our sales volume of 14% was due primarily to greater granular urea and UAN volume available for sale due to our completed capacity expansion projects, partly offset by lower ammonia sales volume due to lower demand in North America during the fall application season. In addition, our ammonia sales volumes were lower in 2016 as we upgraded existing ammonia production as a result of our granular urea and UAN capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales increased $84 million, or 3%, from 2015 to 2016. The overall increase in cost of sales is due primarily to the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased cost of sales by $251 million, or 9%, as 2016 includes a full year of CF Fertilisers UK results and 2015 includes five months of CF Fertilisers UK results. The remaining decrease in our cost of sales of $167 million, or 6%, was due primarily to the combination of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives and lower realized natural gas costs, partly offset by higher capacity expansion project related costs. Cost of sales includes a $260 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain in 2016 as compared to a $176 million unrealized net mark-to-market loss in 2015. Realized natural gas costs, including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivatives, declined 6% from $3.28 per MMBtu in 2015 to $3.07 per MMBtu in 2016 as natural gas prices were lower in 2016, particularly in the first half of the year with high storage levels and strong production in North America, although natural gas prices increased towards the end of 2016.\nCapacity expansion project costs, including depreciation expense, which commenced once the respective expansion plant was placed in service, totaled $116 million in 2016. Start-up costs, which primarily relate to the cost of commencing production at the new ammonia plants for our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa plants, totaled $52 million in 2016.\nCost of goods sold per ton declined $33 per ton, or 16%, from $201 in 2015 to $168 in 2016, as a result of the factors noted above.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $4 million to $174 million in 2016 from $170 million in 2015. The increase was due primarily to the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, partly offset by lower costs for corporate office initiatives and lower intangible asset amortization expense.\nTransaction Costs\nIn 2016, we incurred $179 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI and our strategic venture with CHS. This includes the $150 million termination fee paid by CF Holdings to OCI in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the Combination Agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services. In 2015, we incurred $57 million of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, our strategic venture with CHS and the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.\nOther Operating-Net\nOther operating-net was $208 million in 2016 compared to $92 million in 2015. The increased expense was due primarily to $93 million of realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions primarily related to British pound denominated intercompany debt that has not been permanently invested. In addition, the increased expense also reflects higher expansion project costs pertaining to our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization and the loss of $23 million representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 8-Fair Value Measurements for additional information. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives of $22 million.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nEquity in (Losses) Earnings of Operating Affiliates\nEquity in (losses) earnings of operating affiliates decreased by $110 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to a $134 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $62 million impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL. The remaining decrease was due primarily to lower operating results from PLNL, which included costs of $21 million that were incurred during 2016 related to a planned maintenance activity at the PLNL ammonia plant that resulted in the shutdown of the plant for approximately 45 days and the impact of lower ammonia selling prices in 2016 compared to 2015. For additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL, see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,\" below, and Note 7-Equity Method Investments.\nInterest Expense-Net\nNet interest expense increased by $64 million to $195 million in 2016 from $131 million in 2015. The $64 million increase in net interest expense was due primarily to the combination of higher debt levels due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of Private Senior Notes in September 2015 and debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to the restructuring of our debt and the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2016. Due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we modified the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2016 by reducing its size from $2.0 billion to $750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms. As a result of these changes, we recognized $16 million of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense. The increase in interest expense-net in 2016 also includes the amortization of capitalized Bridge Credit Agreement fees of $28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain of the OCI businesses. We also recorded capitalized interest of $166 million in 2016 related primarily to our capacity expansion projects compared to $154 million in 2015.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLoss on debt extinguishment of $167 million in 2016 consists of the make-whole payment, which resulted from our November 21, 2016 prepayment of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. This amount excludes $3 million (of the $170 million make-whole payment), which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Provision\nOur income tax benefit for 2016 was $68 million on a pre-tax loss of $226 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.0%, compared to an income tax provision of $396 million on pre-tax income of $1.06 billion, or an effective tax rate of 37.4%, in the prior year.\nState income taxes for 2016 were favorably impacted by investment tax credits of $13 million related to capital assets placed in service at our production facilities in Oklahoma that are indefinitely available to offset income taxes in that jurisdiction in future years. Our effective state income tax rate was also reduced as a result of the changes to our legal entity structure effected in the first quarter of 2016 as part of our strategic venture with CHS. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nState income taxes for 2016 includes a tax benefit of $46 million, net of federal tax effect, for state net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe income tax provision for 2016 includes the tax impact of the recaptured U.S. manufacturing profits deductions claimed in prior years that will not be deductible as a result of our intention to carryback the tax net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 to those prior tax years.\nNon-deductible capital costs for the tax year ended December 31, 2016 include certain transaction costs capitalized in the prior year that are now deductible as a result of the termination of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI.\nForeign subsidiaries of the Company have incurred capital losses of $109 million that are indefinitely available to offset capital gains in those foreign jurisdictions. As the future realization of these carryforwards is not anticipated, a valuation allowance of $28 million was recorded in 2016.\nIn the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $134 million and $62 million,\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nrespectively, which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our respective income tax provisions do not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us and recognized a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK. The earnings in CF Fertilisers UK have been permanently reinvested. Therefore, the recognition of the $94 million million gain on the remeasurement of the historical equity investment does not include the recognition of tax expense on the gain.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP, as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $119 million and $34 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are included in (loss) earnings before income taxes and equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates, impact the effective tax rate in both years. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2016 due to our strategic venture with CHS that commenced on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nSee Note 9-Income Taxes for additional information.\nEquity in Earnings of Non-Operating Affiliates-Net of Taxes\nEquity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities that we account for using the equity method and exclude from operating earnings. Equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes in 2015 included the previously owned 50% equity method earnings of CF Fertilisers UK and also included our share of operating losses experienced at Keytrade. On July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us for total consideration of $570 million, and CF Fertilisers UK became wholly owned by us and part of our consolidated financial results. We recorded a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK in connection with the closing of the acquisition. Equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates-net of taxes on 2015 also included our share of CF Fertilisers UK operating results up to the date of the acquisition. In addition, during the second quarter of 2015, we sold our interests in Keytrade and recorded an after-tax loss of $29 million (pre-tax loss of $40 million).\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $85 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN. This increase is partly offset by lower net earnings attributable to the approximately 24.7% interest of the publicly held common units of TNCLP.\nDiluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nDiluted net (loss) earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased $4.15 to a loss of $1.19 per share in 2016 from diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.96 per share in 2015. This decrease is due to lower net earnings.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nOur reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker, as defined in the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), assesses the performance of our reportable segments and makes decisions about resource allocation. These segments are differentiated by products. Our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Total other operating costs and expenses (consisting of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating-net) and non-operating expenses (interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management.\nThe following table presents summary operating results by business segment:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) The cost of ammonia that is upgraded into other products is transferred at cost into the upgraded product results. \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nAmmonia Segment\nOur ammonia segment produces anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is our most concentrated nitrogen fertilizer as it contains 82% nitrogen. The results of our ammonia segment consist of sales of ammonia to external customers. In addition, ammonia is the \"basic\" nitrogen product that we upgrade into other nitrogen products such as granular urea, UAN and AN. We produce ammonia at all of our nitrogen manufacturing complexes.\nThe following table presents summary operating data for our ammonia segment:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nN/M-Not Meaningful\n (1) Ammonia represents 82% nitrogen content. Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons. \n (2) Includes CF Fertilisers UK results since July 31, 2015, the date of our acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest not previously owned by us.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales in the ammonia segment increased by $228 million, or 23%, to $1.21 billion in 2017 from $981 million in 2016 due primarily to a 43% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 13% decrease in average selling prices. The increase in sales volume was due to higher production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in December 2016. Average selling prices declined due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. Selling prices strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2017 rising approximately 3% compared to the prior year period.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment averaged $261 per ton in 2017, a 5% increase from $248 per ton in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, in addition to higher depreciation as a result of the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities, partially offset by the start-up costs for those plants in 2016 and production efficiencies realized in 2017 due to increased volume. Depreciation and amortization in our ammonia segment in 2017 was $45 per ton compared to $33 per ton in 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales in the ammonia segment decreased by $542 million, or 36%, to $981 million in 2016 from $1.52 billion in 2015 due primarily to a 33% decrease in average selling prices and a 4% decrease in sales volume. These results include the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased net sales by $26 million, or 2%. The remaining decrease in our ammonia net sales of $568 million, or 37%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices and sales volume. Selling prices declined due to excess global nitrogen supply. In addition, our selling prices reflect the impact of a higher proportion of export sales, the volumes of which increased as a result of the weak fall application season attributable to the combined impact of weather conditions and low crop prices on our customers' decisions related to applying fertilizer in the fall. Sales volume in 2016 declined due to the combination of the weak fall application season and the impact of upgrading additional ammonia production at our Donaldsonville facility into granular urea and UAN as a result of our capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment averaged $248 per ton in 2016, including the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which averaged $220 per ton. The remaining cost of sales per ton was $250 in 2016, a 16% decrease from the $296 per ton in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015 and to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs in 2016. This was partly offset by capacity expansion project start-up costs of $50 million and an increase in expansion project depreciation as a result of the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities.\nGranular Urea Segment\nOur granular urea segment produces granular urea, which contains 46% nitrogen. Produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide, it has the highest nitrogen content of any of our solid nitrogen fertilizers. Granular urea is produced at our Courtright, Ontario; Donaldsonville, Louisiana; Medicine Hat, Alberta; and Port Neal, Iowa nitrogen complexes.\nThe following table presents summary operating data for our granular urea segment: \n______________________________________________________________________________\nN/M-Not Meaningful\n (1) Granular urea represents 46% nitrogen content. Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales in the granular urea segment increased by $140 million, or 17%, to $971 million in 2017 compared to $831 million in 2016 due primarily to a 21% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 3% decrease in average selling prices. Sales volume was higher due primarily to increased production at our new Port Neal facility, which came on line in the fourth quarter of 2016. Average selling prices decreased to $223 per ton in 2017 compared to $231 per ton in 2016 due primarily to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. Selling prices strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2017 rising approximately 14% compared to the prior year period.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our granular urea segment averaged $197 in 2017, a 22% increase from the $162 per ton in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher depreciation as a result of the new granular urea plant at our Port Neal facility, an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in 2017 compared to a gain in the comparable period of 2016 and higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives. These increases in cost of sales were partially offset by the impact of production efficiencies due to increased volume. Depreciation and amortization in our granular urea segment in 2017 was $56 per ton compared to $31 per ton in 2016.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales in the granular urea segment increased by $43 million, or 5%, to $831 million in 2016 compared to $788 million in 2015 due primarily to a 46% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 28% decrease in average selling prices. Sales volume was higher due to increased production available as a result of our expanded urea capacity at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex that came on line in November of 2015. Average selling prices decreased to $231 per ton in 2016 compared to $320 per ton in 2015 due primarily to excess global nitrogen supply weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our granular urea segment averaged $162 in 2016, a 15% decrease from the $191 per ton in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015. This was partly offset by increased depreciation expense related to our expanded urea production at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex and $2 million of start-up costs at our Port Neal, Iowa complex that came on line in December 2016.\nUAN Segment\nOur UAN segment produces urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN). UAN, a liquid fertilizer product with a nitrogen content that typically ranges from 28% to 32%, is produced by combining urea and ammonium nitrate. UAN is produced at our nitrogen complexes in Courtright, Ontario; Donaldsonville, Louisiana; Port Neal, Iowa; Verdigris, Oklahoma; Woodward, Oklahoma; and Yazoo City, Mississippi.\nThe following table presents summary operating data for our UAN segment:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nN/M-Not Meaningful\n (1) UAN represents between 28% and 32% of nitrogen content, depending on the concentration specified by the customer. Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales in the UAN segment decreased $62 million, or 5%, to $1.13 billion in 2017 due primarily to an 11% decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 6% increase in sales volume. Average selling prices decreased to $160 per ton in 2017 compared to $179 per ton in 2016. UAN average selling prices were lower due primarily to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. Selling prices strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2017 rising approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. Our sales volume was higher due primarily to growth in our North American customer base and higher export sales.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our UAN segment averaged $149 in 2017, an 8% increase from the average of $138 per ton in 2016. The increase was due primarily to the impact of an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nderivatives in 2017 compared to a gain in 2016 and the impact of higher realized natural gas costs in 2017, including the impact of realized derivatives, partially offset by targeted cost reduction initiatives and production efficiencies due to increased volume. Depreciation and amortization in our UAN segment in both 2017 and 2016 was $37 per ton.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales in the UAN segment decreased $284 million, or 19%, to $1.20 billion in 2016 due primarily to a 29% decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 14% increase in sales volume. Average selling prices decreased to $179 per ton in 2016 compared to $252 per ton in 2015. UAN selling prices were lower due to excess global nitrogen supply weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. Increases in UAN exports at lower selling prices also negatively impacted our average selling price. Sales volume was higher due to increased production as a result of expanded UAN capacity at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex that came on line in the first quarter of 2016.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our UAN segment averaged $138 in 2016, a 15% decrease from the average of $162 per ton in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015 and the impact of lower realized natural gas cost in 2016. This was partly offset by increased depreciation expense related to the expanded UAN capacity at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex that came on line in the first quarter of 2016.\nAN Segment\nOur AN segment produces ammonium nitrate (AN). AN is a nitrogen-based product with a nitrogen content between 29% and 35%. AN is used as nitrogen fertilizer and is also used by industrial customers for commercial explosives and blasting systems. AN is produced at our nitrogen complexes in Yazoo City, Mississippi and Ince and Billingham, United Kingdom.\nThe following table presents summary operating data for our AN segment:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nN/M-Not Meaningful\n (1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons. \n (2) Includes CF Fertilisers UK results since July 31, 2015, the date of our acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest not previously owned by us.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales. Total net sales in our AN segment increased $86 million, or 21%, to $497 million in 2017 from $411 million in 2016 due to a 10% increase in average realized selling prices and a 9% increase in sales volume, due to the commencement of a new long-term supply arrangement and a strong summer sales campaign in the United Kingdom. The increase in average realized selling prices is net of the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes between the U.S. dollar and the British pound, which reduced net sales by $14 million.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCost of Sales. Total cost of sales per ton in our AN segment averaged $189 in 2017, a 1% decrease from $190 per ton in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to the costs in 2016 related to the completion of the reconfiguration at our Yazoo City complex, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes between the U.S. dollar and the British pound, and plant outages in the prior year. These decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by higher realized natural gas costs and the impact of an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in 2017 compared to a gain in 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Total net sales in our AN segment increased $117 million, or 40%, to $411 million in 2016 from $294 million in 2015 due primarily to a 67% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 16% decrease in average selling prices. These results include the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased net sales by $164 million, or 56%. The remaining decrease in our AN net sales of $47 million, or 16%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.\nCost of Sales. Total cost of sales per ton in our AN segment averaged $190 in 2016 including the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which averaged $211 per ton. The remaining cost of sales per ton averaged $180 in 2016, a 20% decrease from 2015 due primarily to unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015 and the impact of lower realized natural gas costs. This decrease also includes the impact of the purchase accounting inventory valuation step-up in 2015 arising out of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition.\nOther Segment\nOur Other segment primarily includes the following products:\n \u2022 Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is an aqueous urea solution typically made with 32.5% high-purity urea and 67.5% deionized water. \n \u2022 Urea liquor is a liquid product that we sell in concentrations of 40%, 50% and 70% urea as a chemical intermediate. \n \u2022 Nitric acid is a nitrogen-based product with a nitrogen content of 22.2%. \n \u2022 Compound fertilizer products (NPKs) are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.  The following table presents summary operating data for our Other segment:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nN/M-Not Meaningful\n (1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons. \n (2) Includes CF Fertilisers UK results since July 31, 2015, the date of our acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest not previously owned by us. \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales. Total net sales in our Other segment increased $53 million, or 20%, to $319 million in 2017 from $266 million in 2016 due to a 24% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 3% decrease in average selling prices. The increase in our Other segment sales volume was due to an increase in DEF sales volume as demand in North America continued to grow. The decline in average selling prices is due to greater global nitrogen supply availability weighing on global nitrogen selling prices and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes between the U.S. dollar and the British pound, which reduced net sales by $6 million.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our Other segment averaged $133 in 2017, a 2% increase from $131 per ton in 2016, due primarily to the impact of an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in 2017 compared to a gain in the comparable period of 2016, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate changes between the U.S. dollar and the British pound and the impact of production efficiencies due to increased volume.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales. Total net sales in our Other segment increased $43 million, or 19%, to $266 million in 2016 from $223 million in 2015 due to a 49% increase in sales volume partially offset by a 20% decrease in average selling prices. These results include the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased net sales by $79 million, or 35%. The remaining decrease in our Other segment net sales of $36 million, or 16%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices due to excess global nitrogen supply weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales per ton in our Other segment averaged $131 in 2016, including the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which averaged $158 per ton. The remaining cost of sales per ton averaged $121 in 2016, an 18% decrease from the $147 per ton in 2015 due to the unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 and the impact of the purchase accounting inventory valuation step-up in 2015 arising out of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, investments, taxes, share repurchases and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business. Generally, our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes cash generated by customer advances. We may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our credit agreements.\nAt December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under the Revolving Credit Agreement and our senior notes.\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $835 million at December 31, 2017, a decline of $329 million from $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016. During 2017, our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events, which are further described below.\n \u2022 Receipt of a federal tax refund of $815 million due to the carryback of certain tax losses primarily arising from our capacity expansion projects \n \u2022 Early redemption and purchase of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes due in 2018 and 2020  Capacity Expansion Project and Receipt of Tax Refund From Tax Loss Carryback\nIn 2016, we completed capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa that were originally announced in 2012. These projects provided us with an increase of approximately 25% in production capacity and had a total capital cost of $5.2 billion. The completion of our capacity expansion projects has reduced what had been a substantial use of liquidity in recent years. See discussion under \"Overview of CF Holdings-Items Affecting Comparability of Results-Depreciation and amortization,\" above, and \"-Capital Spending,\" below, for further information on these projects.\nA significant portion of the capital assets that were constructed as part of the capacity expansion projects qualified for bonus depreciation under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act). Under the provisions of the PATH Act, eligible capital additions are subject to 50% bonus depreciation in the year the asset is placed in service. We generated a substantial federal net operating loss in 2016, primarily as a result of the bonus depreciation deductions. In the second quarter of 2017, we received a federal tax refund of $815 million as a result of the claim to carry back the 2016 federal net operating loss to prior income tax years.\nEarly Redemption and Purchase of Senior Notes\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) at a total purchase price of approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. See discussion under \"Debt-Senior Notes-Senior Secured Notes,\" below, for further information.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less. Under our short-term investment policy, we may invest our cash balances, either directly or through mutual funds, in several types of investment-grade securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations. Securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments; those issued by state, local or other governmental entities; and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCapital Spending\nWe make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base, increase our capacity, improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $473 million in 2017 compared to $2.21 billion in 2016 with the decrease primarily due to completion in 2016 of our capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa. Capital expenditures in 2017 include approximately $110 million of payments to contractors and vendors for work completed on our capacity expansion projects in 2016.\nProjected Capital Spending\nCapital expenditures for new activity in 2018 are estimated to be in the range of $400 to $450 million. Planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, delay in the receipt of equipment, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties.\nPurchase of Publicly Traded Common Units of TNCLP\nOn February 7, 2018, we announced that TNGP elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP. See Note 26-Subsequent Event for additional information.\nGovernment Policies\nThe policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes, duties, tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials, finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world. The policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices, and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers, or farmers. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic, political and social objectives. Additionally, the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity. The impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity.\nEthanol Industry and the Renewable Fuel Standard\nCorn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38% of total U.S. corn demand. U.S. government policy, as expressed in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), is a major determinant for the ethanol market. The RFS establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels, including ethanol, that must be included in the United States' supply of fuel for transportation. In addition, the U.S. Congress, at various times, has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the RFS. While past legislation proposing changes to the RFS has not been enacted into law, there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law. Other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol, gasoline and corn. Lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry, which could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nRepatriation of Foreign Earnings and Income Taxes\nWe have operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and an interest in a joint venture in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Historically, the estimated additional U.S. and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the U.S. were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized, unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans. However, the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation. As a result, the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings, as applicable, and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods.\nIn light of changes made by the Tax Act, commencing with the 2018 tax year, the United States no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the United States, unless such earnings are subject to U.S. rules on passive income or certain anti-abuse provisions. Foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the United States.\nCash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately $152 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of $835 million was held primarily by our Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries. Historically, the cash balance held by the Canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested. As of December 31, 2017, as a result of the amounts accrued in the transition tax liability recorded as a result of the Tax Act, we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the Canadian and United Kingdom cash balances if we were to repatriate this cash in the future.\nDebt\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nWe have a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) providing for a revolving credit facility of up to $750 million with a maturity of September 18, 2020. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of $125 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. CF Industries may designate as borrowers one or more wholly owned subsidiaries that are organized in the United States or any state thereof, or the District of Columbia.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euro and British pounds, and bear interest at a per annum rate equal to an applicable eurocurrency rate or base rate plus, in either case, a specified margin, and the borrowers are required to pay an undrawn commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement and customary letter of credit fees. The specified margin and the amount of the commitment fee depend on CF Holdings' credit rating at the time.\nThe borrowers and guarantors under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which are currently comprised of CF Holdings, CF Industries and CF Holdings' wholly owned subsidiaries CF Industries Enterprises, Inc. (CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS), are referred to together herein as the Loan Parties. CF Holdings and CF Industries guaranteed the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Agreement prior to the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, and, upon the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, CFE and CFS also became guarantors of the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to specified exceptions, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires that each direct or indirect domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings that guarantees debt for borrowed money of any Loan Party in excess of $150 million become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to specified exceptions, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires a grant of a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties, to secure the obligations of the Loan Parties thereunder.\nIn addition to the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Loan Parties also guarantee the obligations under any (i) letter of credit facilities, letter of credit reimbursement agreements, letters of credit, letters of guaranty, surety bonds or similar arrangements in an aggregate amount up to $300 million and (ii) interest rate or other hedging arrangements, in each case between CF Holdings or certain of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any person that is a lender or the administrative agent under the Revolving Credit Agreement or an affiliate of such person, on the other hand, that are designated by CF Industries as Secured Bilateral LC Facilities or Secured Swap Agreements (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement (such additional obligations, the Additional\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nGuaranteed Obligations). Obligations under Secured Bilateral LC Facilities in an aggregate amount up to $300 million and obligations under Secured Swap Agreements are secured by the same security interest that secures the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants customary for a financing of this type. Prior to the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, the Revolving Credit Agreement limited the ability of non-guarantor subsidiaries of CF Holdings to incur indebtedness and limited the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to grant liens, merge or consolidate with other entities and sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity, in each case, subject to specified exceptions. The November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment modified the negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement to limit further the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to grant liens and add limitations on the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to incur debt, pay dividends, voluntarily prepay certain debt, make investments and dispose of assets, in each case, subject to specified exceptions (such further and additional limitations, the Additional Negative Covenants).\nThe financial covenants applicable to CF Holdings and its subsidiaries in the Revolving Credit Agreement (the New Financial Covenants):\n (i) restrict the ratio of total secured debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to a maximum of 3.75:1.00, \n (ii) require the ratio of EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated interest expense (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to be a minimum of 1.20:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending on or prior to December 31, 2018, and 1.50:1.00 thereafter, and \n (iii) require the ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than or equal to 0.60:1.00.  Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, if on any date certain conditions were met, including (i) an absence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement, (ii) the receipt of an investment grade corporate rating for CF Holdings from two of three selected ratings agencies and (iii) the ratio of CF Holdings' total net debt to EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended being less than 3.75:1.00, CF Industries would be able to, at its option, choose to (w) suspend the Additional Negative Covenants, (x) replace the New Financial Covenants with covenants requiring the ratio of total net debt to EBITDA for the period of four fiscal consecutive quarters most recently ended to be less than or equal to 3.75:1.00 and the ratio of EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to be not less than 2.75:1.00, (y) release the collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and (z) release the guarantees supporting, and the collateral securing, the Secured Bilateral LC Facilities and the Secured Swap Agreements. Such a choice by CF Industries would commence a \"Covenant Suspension Period\" that would expire upon the Company's no longer having an investment grade corporate rating from two of three selected rating agencies. Upon the expiration of a Covenant Suspension Period, the Additional Negative Covenants and the New Financial Covenants would be reinstated, and the Loan Parties party to the Revolving Credit Agreement would be required to guarantee the Additional Guaranteed Obligations and grant a first priority security interest in substantially all of each Loan Party's assets, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties, subject to certain exceptions, to secure the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Secured Bilateral LC Facilities and the Secured Swap Agreements.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains events of default (with notice requirements and cure periods, as applicable) customary for a financing of this type, including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal, interest or fees; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; and failure to comply with specified covenants. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and after any applicable cure period, subject to specified exceptions, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite lenders is required to, accelerate the loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement or terminate the lenders' commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had excess borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $695 million (net of outstanding letters of credit of $55 million). There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016, or during 2017. Maximum borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $150 million with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 1.85%.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLetters of Credit\nIn addition to the letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, as described above, we have also entered into a bilateral agreement with capacity to issue letters of credit up to $75 million. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $72 million of letters of credit were outstanding under this agreement.\nSenior Notes\nLong-term debt presented on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consisted of the following Public Senior Notes (unsecured) and Senior Secured Notes issued by CF Industries: \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Carrying amount is net of unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs. Total unamortized debt discount was $12 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and total deferred debt issuance costs were $46 million and $60 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  Public Senior Notes\nUnder the indentures (including the applicable supplemental indentures) governing our senior notes due 2018, 2020, 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 (the Public Senior Notes), each series of Public Senior Notes is guaranteed by CF Holdings, and, in connection with the effectiveness of the November 2016 amendment to our Revolving Credit Agreement, CF Holdings' wholly owned subsidiaries CF Industries Enterprises, Inc. (CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS) became subsidiary guarantors of the Public Senior Notes.\nInterest on the Public Senior Notes is payable semiannually, and the Public Senior Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.\nIf a Change of Control occurs together with a Ratings Downgrade (as both terms are defined under the indentures governing the Public Senior Notes), CF Industries would be required to offer to repurchase each series of Public Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, in the event that a subsidiary of CF Holdings, other than CF Industries, becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any renewal, replacement or refinancing thereof), such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the Public Senior Notes, provided that such requirement will no longer apply with respect to the Public Senior Notes due 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 following the repayment of the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020 or the subsidiaries of ours, other than CF Industries, otherwise becoming no longer subject to such a requirement to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020.\nOn December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\napproximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes). The aggregate purchase price was approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million, primarily consisting of $48 million of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn November 21, 2016, CF Industries issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.400% senior secured notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Senior Secured Notes). The net proceeds, after deducting discounts and offering expenses, from the issuance and sale of the Senior Secured Notes were approximately $1.23 billion. CF Industries used approximately $1.18 billion of the net proceeds for the prepayment (including payment of a make-whole amount of approximately $170 million and accrued interest) in full of the outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 2022, 2025 and 2027 (Private Senior Notes) issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015.\nInterest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1 beginning on June 1, 2017, and the Senior Secured Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.\nUnder the terms of the applicable indenture, the Senior Secured Notes of each series are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by CF Holdings and each current and future domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) that from time to time is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The requirement for any subsidiary of CF Holdings to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes of a series will apply only until, and the subsidiary guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes of a series will be automatically released upon, the latest to occur of (a) CF Holdings having an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there being no default or event of default under the applicable Indenture, (b) the retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2018 or the subsidiaries of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) otherwise becoming no longer subject to the requirement, described in the second paragraph under \"-Public Senior Notes,\" above, to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and (c) the retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2020 or the subsidiaries of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) otherwise becoming no longer subject to the requirement, described in the second paragraph under \"-Public Senior Notes,\" above, to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2020. In accordance with the applicable indenture, CFE and CFS, in addition to CF Holdings, guaranteed the Senior Secured Notes of each series upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the obligations under each series of Senior Secured Notes and each guarantor's related guarantee are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of CF Industries, CF Holdings and the subsidiary guarantors, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties (the Collateral). The obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, together with certain letter of credit, hedging and similar obligations and future pari passu secured indebtedness, will be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes. The liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes of a series and the related guarantees will be automatically released and the covenant under the applicable indenture limiting dispositions of Collateral will no longer apply if, on any date after the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, CF Holdings has an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there is no default or event of default under the applicable indenture.\nUnder each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, specified changes of control involving CF Holdings or CF Industries, when accompanied by a ratings downgrade, as defined with respect to the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes, constitute change of control repurchase events. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to the 2021 Notes or the 2026 Notes, as applicable, unless CF Industries has exercised its option to redeem such Senior Secured Notes, CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, to incur liens on certain assets to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, to sell or transfer Collateral, to merge or consolidate with other entities and to sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity. Each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest on the applicable Senior Secured Notes; failure to comply with other covenants or agreements under the indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; the failure of CF Holdings' or certain subsidiaries' guarantees of the applicable Senior Secured Notes to be enforceable; lack of validity or perfection of any lien\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nsecuring the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees with respect to Collateral having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than a specified amount; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Under each indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of an event of default arising from one of the specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the applicable Senior Secured Notes would become due and payable immediately, and, in the case of any other event of default (other than an event of default related to CF Industries' and CF Holdings' reporting obligations), the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable Senior Secured Notes then outstanding may declare all of such Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.\nPrivate Senior Notes\nThe senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes), issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015, were governed by the terms of a note purchase agreement (as amended, including by an amendment effective September 7, 2016, the Note Purchase Agreement). The Private Senior Notes were guaranteed by CF Holdings. All obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement were unsecured.\nOn November 21, 2016, we prepaid in full the outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our Private Senior Notes. The prepayment of $1.18 billion included the payment of a make-whole amount of approximately $170 million and accrued interest. Loss on debt extinguishment of $167 million on our consolidated statements of operations excludes $3 million of the make-whole payment, which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.\nBridge Credit Agreement\nOn September 18, 2015, in connection with our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, CF Holdings and CF Industries entered into a senior unsecured 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders' commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically. There were no borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. See Note 12-Interest Expense for additional information.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nOur Board of Directors (the Board) authorized certain programs to repurchase shares of our common stock. Each of these programs permitted repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market, through privately-negotiated transactions, through block transactions or otherwise. Our management determined the manner, timing and amount of repurchases based on the evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors. On August 6, 2014, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $1 billion of the common stock of CF Holdings through December 31, 2016 (the 2014 Program). As of December 31, 2016, 15.9 million shares had been repurchased for an aggregate expenditure of $900 million. The remaining $100 million of share repurchase authorization under the 2014 Program expired on December 31, 2016. No share repurchase programs were authorized by the Board in 2017.\nForward Sales and Customer Advances\nWe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. Therefore, our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment.\nCustomer advances, which typically represent a portion of the contract's sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $89 million and $42 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWhile customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity, the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers' outlook of future market fundamentals. During periods of declining prices, such as the current environment, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices. If the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Additionally, borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nUnder our forward sales programs, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. These delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us. Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer's inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales.\nNatural Gas Prices\nNatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN and other nitrogen products. Expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs. For example, natural gas costs, including realized gains and losses, comprised approximately 47% of our total production costs in 2017. As a result, natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity.\nBecause most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations, natural gas prices in North America have declined since 2008, but are subject to volatility. During 2017, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in North America, reached a low of $2.44 per MMBtu on February 28, 2017 and a high of $3.65 per MMBtu on three consecutive days in January 2017. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub reached a low of $1.49 per MMBtu on three consecutive days in March 2016 and a high of $3.77 per MMBtu on December 8, 2016.\nWe also have manufacturing facilities located in the United Kingdom. These facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in Europe. The major natural gas trading point for the United Kingdom is the National Balancing Point (NBP). During 2017, the daily closing price at NBP reached a low of $3.30 per MMBtu on June 15, 2017 and a high of $9.00 per MMBtu on December 12, 2017. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, the daily closing price at NBP reached a low of $2.80 per MMBtu on September 1, September 12 and September 14, 2016, and a high of $9.00 per MMBtu on December 12, 2017.\nNatural gas costs in our cost of sales, including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, increased 11% per MMBtu in 2017 from 2016.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based fertilizers. From time to time, we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Because we use derivative instruments, volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the value of the derivatives. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market losses (gains) on natural gas derivatives of $61 million, $(260) million and $176 million, respectively, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. We control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks, other major financial institutions or large energy companies, and, in most cases, the use of International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting arrangements. The ISDA agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement.\nThe ISDA agreements to most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade, our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. The Revolving Credit Agreement, at any time when it is secured, provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to, or affiliates of parties to, the Revolving Credit Agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives. In the event the Revolving Credit Agreement becomes unsecured, separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was $12 million and zero, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the credit-\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nrisk-related contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 35.9 million MMBtus and 183.0 million MMBtus, respectively. At both December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts.\nEmbedded Derivative Liability\nUnder the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of $5 million to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026.\nThis obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as an embedded derivative and its value is included in other liabilities. See Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe contributed $82 million to our pension plans in 2017. The contributions in 2017 include a voluntary contribution of $59 million made in the second quarter of 2017. We expect to contribute approximately $41 million to our pension plans in 2018.\nDistributions on Noncontrolling Interest in CFN\nThe CFN Board of Managers approved semi-annual distribution payments during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, in accordance with the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of CFN, as follows: \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $1.63 billion as compared to $617 million in 2016, an increase of $1,014 million. The increase was primarily due to working capital changes including the receipt of our $815 million income tax refund related to the claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior income tax years. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also a result of entering 2017 with a lower level of customer advances than 2016 due to customer reluctance to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment. These increases were partially offset by higher contributions to our pension plans. In 2017, we contributed $82 million to our pension plans compared to $23 million in 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $617 million as compared to $1.21 billion in 2015, a decline of $590 million. The decline resulted primarily from lower net earnings during 2016 due to lower selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply, partially offset by lower amounts of cash used for working capital purposes. Lower working capital levels in accounts receivable and inventory, plus lower amounts paid for income taxes and certain income tax refunds received in 2016, contributed to the reduction in cash used for working capital. Favorable changes in working capital also included a greater proportion of sales paid in 2016 as compared to the prior year period as we entered 2016 with a lower level of customer advances than in 2015 due to customers' hesitancy to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $408 million in 2017 compared to $2.18 billion in 2016. This $1.77 billion decrease is due primarily to lower capital expenditures as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa at the end of 2016. During 2017, capital expenditures totaled $473 million compared to $2.21 billion in 2016. The $2.98 billion net cash used in investing activities in 2015 included $2.47 billion in capital expenditures and the 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us for a net cash payment of $552 million, which was net of cash acquired of $18 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.56 billion in 2017 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.44 billion in 2016 and $77 million in 2015. In 2017, we paid $1.15 billion in connection with the early redemption of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2018 Notes, the purchase of approximately $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes pursuant to a tender offer and premiums paid for the early retirement of long-term debt. In 2016, CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for $2.8 billion. In 2017 and 2016, we distributed $131 million and $119 million, respectively, to the noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP. In 2015, we distributed $45 million to the noncontrolling interest in TNCLP. The increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the CHS strategic venture, which increased the distributions by $79 million, representing the distributions paid to CHS in the third quarter of 2016 for the distribution period ended June 30, 2016.\nIn 2016, we received proceeds of approximately $1.24 billion, net of discounts, from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes which were used to fund the prepayment of the $1.0 billion of Private Senior Notes and the related make-whole payment of $170 million. In 2015, we issued the Private Senior Notes and received proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. No share repurchases were made during 2017 and 2016 compared to cash used for share repurchases in 2015 of $556 million.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Based on debt balances before discounts, offering expenses and interest rates as of December 31, 2017. \n (2) Includes anticipated expenditures under certain contracts to transport finished product to and from our facilities. The majority of these arrangements allow for reductions in usage based on our actual operating rates. Amounts set forth in this table are based on projected normal operating rates and contracted or current spot prices, where applicable, as of December 31, 2017 and actual operating rates and prices may differ. \n (3) Includes minimum commitments to purchase and transport natural gas based on prevailing market-based forward prices as of December 31, 2017 excluding reductions for plant maintenance and turnaround activities. Purchase obligations do not include any amounts related to our natural gas derivatives. See Note 14-Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. \n (4) Includes a commitment to purchase ammonia from PLNL at market-based prices under an agreement that expires in September 2018. The purchase commitment is $73 million based on market prices as of December 31, 2017. This agreement includes automatic consecutive one-year renewals, unless otherwise terminated by either party in advance. Assuming the agreement is not terminated by either party and based on market prices as of December 31, 2017, the annual commitment would be $97 million. \n (5) Represents the contributions we expect to make to our pension plans during 2018. Our pension funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum legal funding requirements plus discretionary amounts that we may deem to be appropriate. \n (6) Excludes $151 million of unrecognized tax benefits, due to the uncertainty in the timing of potential tax payments, and the estimated transition tax liability of $57 million resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 9-Income Taxes for additional information. \n (7) Excludes $15 million of environmental remediation liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of payments. \n (8) Excludes $5 million annual payments to CHS related to our embedded derivative due to uncertainty of future credit ratings, as this is only applicable until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026. See Note 8-Fair Value Measurements or Note 16-Noncontrolling Interests for additional information.  On April 2, 2018, TNGP will purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP for approximately $390 million in the aggregate. See Note 26-Subsequent Event for additional information.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of our products. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to eleven years and the barge charter commitments range from one to seven years. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one to five years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party. See Note 23-Leases for additional information.\nWe do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, rebates, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize expenses, assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. U.S. income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. We adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.\nHistorically, a deferred income tax liability was recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture that were considered to not be permanently reinvested. No deferred income tax liability was recorded for the remainder of our investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture, which we believed to be permanently reinvested. In light of changes made by the Tax Act, the Company is evaluating whether it will continue to treat foreign subsidiary earnings as being permanently reinvested.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nAs a large commercial enterprise with international operations, our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors. The most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation in the countries in which we operate, changes in the geographic mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses, and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint venture that could be subjected to U.S. taxation. It is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense, net income and liquidity in future periods.\nWe operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions. The taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe, including the countries in which we operate. The tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries. As a result, there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances. We work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions. However, there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical. As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of $151 million, which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions. This amount represents our best estimate of the potential amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions. Differences in interpretation of the tax laws, including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions, can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nWe review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with U.S. GAAP in order to assess recoverability. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, selling prices, raw material costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process. The recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Adverse changes in demand for our products, increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review.\nThe recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value, and the reduction in value is other than temporary, the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings.\nPLNL is our joint venture investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the NGC pursuant to the NGC Contract. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which have reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. The NGC Contract had an initial expiration date of September 2018 and has been extended on the same terms until September 2023. Any NGC commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price. PLNL and NGC are currently parties to arbitration proceedings where the main issue remaining in dispute is PLNL's claims for damages for past and ongoing curtailments.\nAlthough the joint venture believes its claims against NGC to be meritorious, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration. There are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture, beyond 2023, that are uncertain at this time, including the quantities of gas NGC will make available, the cost of such gas, the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing. As part of our 2016 impairment assessment of our equity method investment in PLNL, we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a $134 million impairment charge. Previously, in 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $62 million related to our equity method investment in PLNL. The carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL at December 31, 2017 is $108 million. If NGC does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to PLNL at prices that permit profitable operations, PLNL may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in PLNL.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. Our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value. If after performing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further testing is performed. However, if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test, we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, if needed, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. We identified no goodwill impairment in our 2017, 2016 or 2015 reviews. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.37 billion and $2.35 billion, respectively.\nIntangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of Terra Industries Inc. consist of customer relationships, which are being amortized over a period of 18 years. The intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of CF Fertilisers UK consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a period of approximately 20 years. Our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nPension Assets and Liabilities\nPension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation (PBO) are discount rates and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, an adjusted retail price index (RPI). Key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on assets (EROA) and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, RPI.\nThe December 31, 2017 PBO was computed based on a weighted-average discount rate of 3.6% for our North America plans and 2.5% for our United Kingdom plans, which were based on yields for high-quality (AA rated or better) fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of December 31. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. The weighted-average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2017 was 4.0% for North America plans and 2.8% for United Kingdom plans. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The 4.2% weighted-average EROA used to calculate pension expense in 2017 for our North America plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. The 4.6% weighted-average EROA used to calculate pension expense in 2017 for our United Kingdom plans is based on expected long-term performance of underlying investments. The EROA for both North America and United Kingdom plans are adjusted for expenses and diversification bonuses. The 3.2% RPI used to calculate our United Kingdom plan PBO and the 3.3% RPI used to calculate 2017 pension expense is developed using the Bank of England implied retail price inflation curve, which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and index-linked government bonds.\nFor North America qualified pension plans, our PBO was $805 million as of December 31, 2017, which was $67 million higher than pension plan assets. For our United Kingdom pension plans, our PBO was $590 million as of December 31, 2017 which was $176 million higher than pension plan assets. The tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our December 31, 2017 PBO and 2017 pension expense:\n\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n\nSee Note

products. Its key products include ammonia, urea, UAN, and AN fertilizers.\n\n- Industry factors like global supply/demand dynamics, trade flows, natural gas prices, and farmers' economics significantly influence its business.\n\n2017 Performance \n- Net sales were $4.13 billion, up 12% from 2016, driven by 18% higher sales volumes partially offset by 5% lower average selling prices.\n\n- Net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $358 million compared to a net loss of $277 million in 2016. This was primarily due to a $491 million tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\n- Gross margin declined from $840 million in 2016 to $430 million in 2017, impacted by lower selling prices, higher unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, and higher depreciation expense.\n\nLiquidity & Cash Flows\n- Cash balance declined $329 million to $835 million, significantly impacted by early debt redemptions/purchases and a federal tax refund related to prior losses.  \n\n- Capital expenditures were $473 million in 2017 compared to $2.2 billion in 2016, reflecting completion of major capacity expansion projects.\n\n- Debt outstanding was $4.75 billion. The company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\n\nThe report then provides more details on the company's revenues, costs, profits, cash flows, balance sheet items, off-balance sheet arrangements, critical accounting policies, and recent accounting standards. It analyzes changes between 2017, 2016, and 2015 across all key financial metrics."}
