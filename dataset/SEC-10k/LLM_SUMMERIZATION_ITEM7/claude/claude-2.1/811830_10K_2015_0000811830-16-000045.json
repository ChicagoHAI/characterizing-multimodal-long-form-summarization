(\"SHUSA\" or the \"Company\") is the parent company of Santander Bank, National Association, (the \"Bank\" or \"SBNA\"), a national banking association, and owns approximately 59% of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, \"SC\"), a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banco Santander, S.A. (\"Santander\").\nThe Bank, previously named Sovereign Bank, National Association, changed its name to Santander Bank, National Association on October 17, 2013. The Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\"). The principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The volumes, and accordingly the financial results, of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint.\nSC's primary business is the indirect origination of retail installment contracts (\"RICs\"), principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. SC also offers a full spectrum of auto financing products and services to Chrysler customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand, the trade name used in providing services (\"Chrysler Capital\") under the ten-year private label financing agreement with the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (\"FCA\"), formerly Chrysler Group LLC signed by SC in 2013 (the \"Chrysler Agreement\"). These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. Under the terms of the Chrysler Agreement, certain standards were agreed to, including SC meeting specified escalating penetration rates for the first five years, and FCA treating SC in a manner consistent with comparable original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") treatment of their captive providers, primarily in regard to sales support. The failure of either party to meet their respective obligations under the agreement could result in the agreement being terminated. While SC has not achieved the targeted penetration rates to date, Chrysler Capital continues to be a focal point of its strategy, and SC continues to work with FCA to improve penetration rates and remains confident about the ongoing success of the Chrysler Agreement.\nSC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has several relationships through which it provides personal unsecured loans, private-label credit cards and other consumer finance products.\nOn January 22, 2014, SC's registration statement for an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of shares of its common stock (the SC Common Stock\u201d), was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Prior to the IPO, the Company owned approximately 65% of SC Common Stock.\nOn January 28, 2014, the IPO closed, and certain stockholders of SC, including the Company and Sponsor Auto Finance Holdings Series LP (\"Sponsor Holdings\"), sold 85,242,042 shares of SC Common Stock. Immediately following the IPO, the Company owned approximately 61% of the shares of SC Common Stock. In connection with these sales, certain board representation, governance and other rights granted to Dundon DFS, LLC (\"DDFS\") and Sponsor Holdings were terminated as a result of the reduction in DDFS and Sponsor Holdings' collective ownership of shares of SC Common Stock below certain ownership thresholds, causing the first quarter 2014 change in control and consolidation of SC (the \"Change in Control\").\nPrior to the Change in Control, the Company accounted for its investment in SC under the equity method. Following the Change in Control, the Company consolidated the financial results of SC in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's consolidation of SC is treated as an acquisition of SC by the Company in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805 - Business Combinations (ASC 805). SC Common Stock is now listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") under the trading symbol \"SC\".\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOverview\nDuring 2015, unemployment improved while market results declined and the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate came in under expectations in most quarters, marking overall mixed results for the U.S. economy.\nThe unemployment rate at December 31, 2015 improved to 5.0% from 5.1% at September 30, 2015 and 5.6% one year ago. According to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, this job growth is primarily attributable to the professional and business services, retail trade, and health care sectors.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis advance estimate indicates that real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 0.7% during the fourth quarter of 2015. This is down from a rate of 2.0% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease during the quarter is primarily attributed to a decrease in personal consumption expenditures, residential fixed investment, and federal government spending, but was offset by increased household spending, state and local government spending, and residential fixed investment.\nMarkets improved in the fourth quarter of 2015, but were, in general, down for the year in total resulting from a decline that began in the second quarter, sparked by the Greek debt crisis and by short-term market trading disruptions in China and the U.S. The total year-to-date returns for the following indices, based on closing prices, at December 31, 2015 were:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dow Jones Industrial Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P 500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASDAQ Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt its December 2015 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC\u201d) announced an increase the federal funds rate target to 0.25%-0.5%. The inflation rate remains just under the targeted rate of 2.0%. This long anticipated increase did result in some impacts on the stock market and a small boost in interest rates.\nThe 10-year Treasury bond rate at December 31, 2015 was 2.27%, up from 2.17% at December 31, 2014. Over the past year, the 10-year Treasury bond rate increased 10 basis points. Within the industry, this metric is often considered to correspond to 15- and 30-year mortgage rates. According to statistics published by the Mortgage Bankers Association, mortgage originations decreased 0.26% from September 30, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and increased from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 by 22.2%. Refinancing activity increased by 28.6% from September 30, 2015, and 35.3% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, respectively.\nRegarding commercial activity, the most recent indicators show that commercial real estate and multifamily originations have decreased compared with the prior quarter and increased compared with the prior year. In addition, the ratio of NPL to total loans has declined for the past four consecutive years for U.S. banks, including a decreasing trend in 2015, which confirms continuing improvement in credit quality and downward trend in general allowance reserves.\nChanging market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The continued low interest rate environment presents challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk, and the associated provision for credit losses and legal expense.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The Company currently does not have credit protection on any of these exposures, nor does it provide lending services in Europe. The Company transacts with various European banks as counterparties to interest rate swaps and foreign currency transactions for its hedging and customer-related activities; however, these derivatives transactions are generally subject to master netting and collateral support agreements, which significantly limit the Company's exposure to loss.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement conducts periodic stress tests of the Company's significant country risk exposures, analyzing the direct and indirect impacts on the risk of loss from various macroeconomic and capital markets scenarios. The Company does not have significant exposure to foreign country risks because its foreign portfolio is relatively small. However, the Company has identified exposure to increased loss from U.S. borrowers associated with the potential indirect impact of a European downturn on the U.S. economy. The Company mitigates these potential impacts through its normal risk management processes, which includes active monitoring and, if necessary, the application of loss mitigation strategies.\nCredit Rating Actions\nThe following table presents Moody's and Standard & Poor's (\"S&P\") credit ratings for the Bank, SHUSA, Santander and the Kingdom of Spain as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>BANK\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHUSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SANTANDER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SPAIN\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LT Senior Debt\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ST Deposits\n</td> <td>P-1\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubsequent to the year end, on February 19, 2016, Moody's downgraded the outlook of the Kingdom of Spain's from positive to stable. In addition, on February 22, 2016, Moody's affirmed and changed the outlook on the A3 long term and senior unsecured debt rating of Santander to stable from positive.\nSHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA.\nAt this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nThe activities of the Company and the Bank are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws, including the Bank Holding Company (\"BHC\") Act, the Federal Reserve Act, the National Bank Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the \"FDIA\"), the Dodd-Frank Act (the \"DFA\"), the Truth-in-Lending Act (which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers), the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (which governs the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (which governs the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies), the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (which requires financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans), the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (the \"SCRA\"), Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce), the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of ATMs and other electronic banking services), as well as other federal and state laws.\nAs SC is a subsidiary of the Company, it is also subject to regulatory oversight from FRB for BHC regulatory supervision purposes, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \"CFPB\").\nDFA\nOn July 21, 2010, the DFA was enacted. The DFA instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector during the financial crisis and includes a number of provisions designed to promote enhanced supervision and regulation of financial companies and financial markets. The DFA introduced a substantial number of reforms that reshape the structure of the regulation of the financial services industry. The enhanced regulation has and will continue to involve higher compliance costs and negatively affect the Company's revenue and earnings.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMore specifically, the DFA imposes enhanced prudential standards on BHCs with at least $50.0 billion in total consolidated assets (often referred to as systemically important financial institutions\u201d or \"SIFIs\"), which includes the Company, and requires the Federal Reserve to establish prudential standards for such BHCs that are more stringent than those applicable to other BHCs, including standards for risk-based requirements and leverage limits; heightened capital and liquidity standards, including eliminating trust preferred securities as Tier 1 regulatory capital; enhanced risk management requirements; and credit exposure reporting and concentration limits. These changes have impacted and are expected to continue impacting the profitability and growth of the Company.\nThe DFA mandates an enhanced supervisory framework, which means that the Company is subject to annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve, and the Company and the Bank are required to conduct semi-annual and annual stress tests, respectively, reporting results to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Federal Reserve also has discretionary authority to establish additional prudential standards, on its own or at the Financial Stability Oversight Council's recommendation, regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits, and otherwise as deemed appropriate.\nUnder the Durbin Amendment to the DFA, in June 2011 the Federal Reserve issued the final rule implementing debit card interchange fee and routing regulation. The final rule establishes standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers including the Bank, are reasonable and proportional\u201d to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions, and prohibits network exclusivity arrangements on debit cards to ensure merchants have choices in how debit card transactions are routed.\nThe DFA established the CFPB, which has broad powers to set the requirements for the terms and conditions of consumer financial products. This has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased compliance costs and reduced revenue.\nIn March 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin recommending that indirect vehicle lenders, including SC, take steps to monitor and impose controls over vehicle dealer \"mark-up\" policies under which dealers impose higher interest rates on certain consumers, with the mark-up shared between the dealer and the lender. In accordance with SC's policy, dealers were allowed to mark-up interest rates by a maximum of 2.00%, but in October 2013 SC reduced the maximum compensation (participation from 2.00% (industry practice) to 1.75%). The Company believes this restriction removes the dealers' incentive to mark-up rates beyond 1.75%. The Company plans to continue to evaluate this policy for effectiveness and may make further changes to strengthen oversight of dealers and mark-up rates.\nOn July 31, 2015, the CFPB notified SC that it had referred to the Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") certain alleged violations by SC of the ECOA regarding (i) statistical disparities in mark-ups charged by automobile dealers to protected groups on loans originated by those dealers and purchased by SC and (ii) the treatment of certain types of income in SC's underwriting process. On September 25, 2015, the DOJ notified SC that it had initiated, based on the referral from the CFPB, an investigation under the ECOA of SC's pricing of automobile loans.\nThe Company routinely executes interest rate swaps for the management of its asset/liability mix, and also executes such swaps with its borrower clients. Under the DFA, the Bank is required to post collateral with certain of its counterparties and clearing exchanges. While clearing these financial instruments offers some benefits and additional transparency in valuation, the system requirements for clearing execution add operational complexities to the business and accordingly increase operational risk exposure.\nProvisions of the DFA relating to the applicability of state consumer protection laws to national banks, including the Bank, became effective in July 2011. Questions may arise as to whether certain state consumer financial laws that were previously preempted by federal law are no longer preempted as a result of these new provisions. Depending on how such questions are resolved, the Bank may experience an increase in state-level regulation of its retail banking business and additional compliance obligations, which may impact revenue and costs. SC is already subject to such state-level regulation.\nThe DFA and certain other legislation and regulations impose various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers. The Company's ability to attract and/or retain talented personnel may be adversely affected by these restrictions.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther requirements of the DFA include increases in the amount of deposit insurance assessments the Bank must pay; changes to the nature and levels of fees charged to consumers, which are negatively affecting the Bank's income; banning banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and restricting their sponsorship of, or investing in, hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to limited exceptions; and increasing regulation of the derivatives markets through measures that broaden the derivative instruments subject to regulation and requiring clearing and exchange trading as well as imposing additional capital and margin requirements for derivatives market participants, which will increase the cost of conducting this business.\nVolcker Rule\nThe DFA added new section 13 to the BHC Act which is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.\u201d The Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity\u201d from engaging in proprietary trading\u201d or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a hedge fund or a private equity fund (together, a Covered Fund\u201d): (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the fund; (ii) controlling the fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities\nBecause the term banking entity\u201d includes an insured depository institution, a depository institution holding company and any affiliate of any of the foregoing, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, SC, the Bank and numerous other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad.\nWhen the agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule approved the final regulations implementing the rule, the Federal Reserve extended the deadline for compliance with the rule until July 21, 2015. The Federal Reserve subsequently extended the deadline by which banking entities were to conform investments in and relationships with Covered Funds and foreign funds that may be subject to the Volcker Rule and that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 ( Legacy Covered Funds\u201d) until July 21, 2016. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve expressed its intention to grant a final one-year extension until July 21, 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships with Legacy Covered Funds. The extension did not apply to non-Legacy Covered Funds or to proprietary trading activities which were required to conform to the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015.\nIn implementing the Volcker Rule, an examination was made of all activities and investments worldwide to determine which banking entities were involved in proprietary trading and/or Covered Fund activity. Based on this review, all proprietary trading that was not permitted under the Volcker Rule was terminated and all Covered Fund activity was addressed under the rule's requirements. As a result, the Company and its banking entity subsidiaries satisfied all requirements of the Volcker Rule for non-Legacy Covered Funds by the July 21, 2015 deadline. In addition, many Legacy Covered Funds have already been conformed to the requirements of the Volcker Rule or will either be conformed to the Volcker Rule's requirements or divested before any deadline for conformance.\nCertain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that are necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule were implemented before July 21, 2015. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on the size of the entity and its level of trading activities. The compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments that are permitted under the rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Volcker Rule. On March 31, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, on behalf of Santander, provided an attestation to the federal agencies responsible for administering the rule that the compliance program requirements applicable to Santander's U.S. operations under the Volcker Rule were met by July 21, 2015.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act established five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution's capital tier depends on its capital levels in relation to various capital measures, which include leverage and risk-based capital measures and certain other factors. Depository institutions that are not classified as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions, payment of management fees, acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBasel III\nNew and evolving capital standards, both as a result of the DFA and the implementation in the U.S. of Basel III, have and will continue to have a significant effect on banks and BHCs, including the Company and the Bank. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC released final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III. The final rules established a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active U.S. banks, formerly known as Basel II, and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over $500 million in assets. Subject to various transition periods, the rule became effective for the largest banks on January 1, 2014, and for all other banks on January 1, 2015.\nThe new rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios that, when fully phased in, will require banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 (\"CET1\") capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter. These requirements for the Company and the Bank went into effect on January 1, 2015.\nA capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios will be phased in over three years starting in 2016, beginning at 0.625% and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. This capital conservation buffer will be required for banking institutions and BHCs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends.\nThe final framework included new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\"), deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 for the Company and the Bank began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased in over three years.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Bank's and the Company's CET1 ratio under Basel III, on a fully phased-in basis under the standardized approach, were 13.36% and 10.97%, respectively. Under the transitions provided under Basel III, the Bank's and the Company's CET1 ratio under the standardized approach, were 13.81% and 11.95%, respectively. The calculation of the CET1 ratio under both a fully phased-in and transition basis is based on management's interpretation of the final rules adopted by the Federal Reserve in July 2013. As part of the implementation of any regulations, management interprets the rules in order to implement the new regulations. If the regulators would interpret the rules differently, there could be an impact to the results of the calculation which may have a negative impact to the calculation of CET1. As mentioned above, the minimum required CET1 ratio is comprised of the 4.5% minimum and the 2.5% conservation buffer. On that basis, the Company believes that, as of December 31, 2015, it would remain above regulatory minimums under the currently enacted capital adequacy requirements of Basel III, including when implemented on a fully phased-in basis.\nSee the Bank Regulatory Capital section of the MD&A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company.\nThe Basel III liquidity framework will require banks and BHCs to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, will be required by regulation going forward. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (\"LCR\"), is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (\"HQLA\") equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. The other, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\"), is designed to promote more medium and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC issued a proposal to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. On September 3, 2014, the agencies approved the final LCR rule. The agencies stressed that LCR is a key component in their effort to strengthen the liquidity soundness of the U.S. financial sector and is used to complement the broader liquidity regulatory framework and supervisory process such as Enhanced Prudential Standards (\"EPS\") and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\"CCAR\"). The agencies have mandated a phased implementation approach under which the most globally important covered companies (more than $700 billion in assets) and large regional financial institutions ($250 billion to $700 billion in assets) were required to report their LCR calculation beginning January 1, 2015. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as SHUSA are required to report their LCR calculation monthly beginning January 1, 2016. On November 13, 2015, the Federal Reserve published a revised final LCR rule. Under this revision, the Company is required to calculate the 'Modified US LCR (the \"US LCR\") on a monthly basis beginning with data as of January 31, 2016 for the BHC. There is no requirement to submit the calculation to the Fed. The Company will be required to publicly disclose its US LCR results starting July 1, 2017. Based on management's interpretation of the final rule, effective on January 1, 2016, the Company's LCR was in excess of the regulatory minimum of 90% which will increase to 100% on January 1, 2017.\nOn October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the final standard for the NSFR. The NSFR requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities, thus reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity position in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. NSFR will become a minimum standard by January 1, 2018.\nThe next step will be publication of a U.S. notice of proposed rule-making on implementation of NSFR.\nStress Tests and Capital Adequacy\nPursuant to the DFA, as part of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR, certain banks and BHCs, including the Company and the Bank, are required to perform stress tests and submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve and the OCC on an annual basis, and receive a notice of non-objection to those capital plans from the Federal Reserve and the OCC before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in the Company's stress tests and capital plans. In March 2014 and 2015, the Federal Reserve, as part of its CCAR process, objected on qualitative grounds to the capital plans submitted by the Company. In its 2015 public report on CCAR, the Federal Reserve cited widespread and critical deficiencies in the Company's capital planning processes, including specific deficiencies in governance, internal controls, risk identification and risk management, management information systems, and supporting assumptions and analysis. As a result of the 2014 and 2015 CCAR objections, the Company is not permitted to make any capital distributions without the Federal Reserve's approval other than the continued payment of dividends on the Company's outstanding class of preferred stock, until a new capital plan is approved by the Federal Reserve. The Company submitted its annual capital plan on April 5, 2016.\nOn May 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of SC declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share of SC Common Stock (the \"May SC dividend\"). The Federal Reserve informed the Company on May 22, 2014 that it did not object to SC's payment of the May SC dividend, provided that Santander contribute at least $20.9 million of capital to the Company prior to such payment, so that the Company's consolidated capital position would be unaffected by the May SC dividend. The Federal Reserve also informed the Company that, until the Federal Reserve issues a non-objection to the Company's capital plan, any future SC dividend will require prior receipt of a written non-objection from the Federal Reserve. On May 28, 2014, the Company issued 84,000 shares of its common stock, no par value per share, to Santander in exchange for cash in the amount of $21.0 million.\nOn September 15, 2014, the Company entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank (the \"FRB\") of Boston and the Federal Reserve. Under the terms of this written agreement, the Company must serve as a source of strength to the Bank; strengthen Board oversight of planned capital distributions by the Company and its subsidiaries; and not declare or pay, and not permit any non-bank subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company to declare or pay, any dividends, and not make, or permit any such subsidiary to make, any capital distribution, in each case without the prior written approval of the FRB of Boston.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn March 11, 2015, the Federal Reserve announced that the Company received an objection from the FRB of Boston to the 2015 capital plan the Company submitted on January 5, 2015. The FRB of Boston objected to the Company's capital plan on qualitative grounds due to significant deficiencies in the Company's capital planning process. Subject to the restrictions outlined above with respect to the written agreement, the FRB did not object to the Company's payment of dividends on its outstanding class of preferred stock. The FRB of Boston did object to the requested payment of dividends on SC Common Stock.\nOn July 2, 2015, the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of that written agreement, the Company is required to make enhancements with respect to, among other matters, board oversight of the consolidated organization, risk management, capital planning and liquidity risk management.\nTotal Loss Absorbing Capacity\nOn October 30, 2015 the Federal Reserve released a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on total loss absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\"), long-term debt (\"LTD\"), and clean holding company requirements for systemically important U.S. BHCs and intermediate holding companies (\"IHCs\") of systemically important foreign banking organizations (\"FBOs\"). SHUSA, as the IHC for Santander in the U.S., will be subject to these requirements.\nTLAC represents the amount of equity and debt a company must hold to facilitate its orderly liquidation. Under the Federal Reserve's proposal, the Company would be required to hold loss absorbing equity and unsecured debt of 18.5% of risk-weighted assets (\"RWAs\") by January 1, 2019 and then 20.5% of RWAs by January 1, 2022. These amounts represent the TLAC requirement (16% by January 1, 2019 and then 18% by January 1, 2022) plus a TLAC buffer of 2.5%. The Federal Reserve's proposal also establishes a requirement for the LTD component of the TLAC. The LTD requirement for the Company would be 7% of RWAs by January 1, 2019.\nThe comment period on the FRB's TLAC proposal ended on February 19, 2016.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards for Liquidity\nOn February 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve approved the final rule implementing certain of the EPS mandated by Section 165 of the DFA (the \"Final Rule\"). The Final Rule applies the EPS to (i) U.S. BHCs with $50 billion (and in some cases $10 billion) or more in total consolidated assets and (ii) foreign banking organizations (\"FBOs\") with a U.S. banking presence exceeding $50 billion in consolidated U.S. non-branch assets. The Final Rule implements, as new requirements for U.S. BHCs, risk management requirements (including requirements, duties and qualifications for a risk management committee and chief risk officer), liquidity stress testing and buffer requirements. U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more on June 30, 2014 were subject to the liquidity requirements as of January 1, 2015.\nFBOs\nOn February 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the Final Rule to strengthen regulatory oversight of FBOs. Under the Final Rule, FBOs with over $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets, including Santander, must consolidate U.S. subsidiary activities under a U.S. intermediate holding company (\"IHC\"). In addition, the Final Rule requires U.S. BHCs and FBOs with at least $50 billion in total U.S. consolidated non-branch assets to be subject to EPS and heightened capital, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander is subject to both of the above provisions of the Final Rule. As a result of this rule, Santander will transfer its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries currently outside of the Company to the Company, which will become an IHC. As required under the Final Rule, the Company submitted its IHC implementation plan to the Federal Reserve on December 31, 2014. A phased-in approach is being used for the standards and requirements at both the FBO and the IHC. As a U.S. BHC with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the Company was subject to EPS as of January 1, 2015. As permitted by the Final Rule, the IHC will be formed, with all but 10% of non-BHC assets included, by July 1, 2016. Other standards of the Final Rule will be phased in through January 1, 2018.\nBank Regulations\nAs a national bank, the Bank is subject to the OCC's regulations under the National Bank Act. The various laws and regulations administered by the OCC for national banks affect corporate practices and impose certain restrictions on activities and investments to ensure that the Bank operates in a safe and sound manner. These laws and regulations also require the Bank to disclose substantial business and financial information to the OCC and the public.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

These limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using this non-GAAP information only as a supplement to evaluate the Company's performance.\nThe Company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Company believes that there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by GAAP or codified in federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess the Company's capital adequacy using these ratios, the Company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company's capitalization to other organizations. However, because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, the Company's calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations, and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The average balance of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $22.1 billion with an average yield of 1.85%, compared to an average balance of $15.5 billion with an average yield of 2.20% for the corresponding period in 2014. Overall, the increase in interest income on investment securities was primarily attributable to an increase of $63.1 million in collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\") as the average balance increased to $8.2 billion from $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014.\nInterest Income on Loans\nInterest income on loans increased $852.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to the growth in originations of the RIC and auto loans and unsecured loan portfolios. Interest income on the RIC and auto loans portfolio increased $862.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This was offset by a decrease in interest on residential mortgage loans of $96.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe average balance of total loans was $80.4 billion with an average yield of 9.46% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $73.3 billion with an average yield of 9.21% for the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in the average balance of total loans of $7.1 billion was primarily due to the growth of the RIC and auto loan portfolio. The average balance of RICs and auto loans, which comprised a majority of the increase, was $24.7 billion with an average yield of 20.36% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $19.9 billion with an average yield of 20.97% for the corresponding period in 2014.\nInterest Expense on Deposits and Related Customer Accounts\nInterest expense on deposits and related customer accounts increased $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The average balance of total interest-bearing deposits was $46.6 billion with an average cost of 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an average balance of $42.4 billion with an average cost of 0.49% for the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in interest expense on deposits and customer-related accounts during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the volume of deposit accounts, along with an increase in average interest rates.\nInterest Expense on Borrowed Funds\nInterest expense on borrowed funds increased $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due to a $9.9 billion increase in total average borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to $3.1 billion of new debt issued by SBNA and the Company and net $2.5 billion of SC securitization activity. The average balance of total borrowings was $44.4 billion with an average cost of 2.13% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an average balance of $34.5 billion with an average cost of 2.45% for the corresponding period in 2014.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The Company records these transactions as sales when the transfers meet all of the accounting criteria for a sale. For those loans sold to the agencies for which the Company retains the servicing rights, the Company recognizes the servicing rights at fair value. These loans are also generally sold with standard representation and warranty provisions, which the Company recognizes at fair value. Any difference between the carrying value of the transferred mortgage loans and the fair value of MBS, servicing rights, and representation and warranty reserves is recognized as gain or loss on sale.\nNet gains on sales of multifamily mortgage loans increased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $29.9 million release in the FNMA recourse reserve for the year ended December 31, 2015. The release of FNMA recourse reserves was attributable to the $1.4 billion purchases of multifamily mortgages during the third quarter from FNMA.\nThe Company previously sold multifamily loans in the secondary market to FNMA while retaining servicing. In September 2009, the Bank elected to stop selling multifamily loans to FNMA and, since that time, has retained all production for the multifamily loan portfolio. Under the terms of the multifamily sales program with FNMA, the Company retained a portion of the credit risk associated with those loans. As a result of that agreement, the Company retains a 100% first loss position on each multifamily loan sold to FNMA under the program until the earlier to occur of (i) the aggregate approved losses on the multifamily loans sold to FNMA reaching the maximum loss exposure for the portfolio as a whole or (ii) all of the loans sold to FNMA under the program are fully paid off.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The servicing asset for these loans has completely amortized.\nThe Company has established a liability related to the fair value of the retained credit exposure for multifamily loans sold to FNMA. This liability represents the amount the Company estimates it would have to pay a third party to assume the retained recourse obligation. The estimated liability represents the present value of the estimated losses the portfolio is projected to incur based upon internal specific information and an industry-based default curve with a range of estimated losses. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had a liability of $6.8 million and $40.7 million, respectively, related to the fair value of the retained credit exposure for multifamily loans sold to FNMA under this program.\nNet gains on hedging activities decreased $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the mortgage loan pipeline valuation and the Company's hedging strategy in the current mortgage rate environment.\nNet gains/(losses) from changes in MSR fair value increased $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The carrying value of the related MSRs at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $147.2 million and $145.0 million, respectively. The MSR asset fair value increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of increases in interest rates.\nThe Company recognized $24.7 million of principal reductions for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $22.0 million for the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was due to continued increases in prepayments and mortgage refinancing as a result of the anticipation of rising interest rates in the near future.\nEquity Method Investments (Loss) / Income, net\nEquity method investments (loss) / income, net decreased $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the Change in Control. In 2014 the Company included one month of accounting for SC as an equity method investment prior to the Change in Control. The Company began accounting for SC as a consolidated subsidiary beginning January 28, 2014. For further discussion see Item 1 Business.\nBOLI\nBOLI income represents fluctuations in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain employees.

The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $235.9 million decrease in fair value associated with the portfolio of loans that the Company accounts for at the fair value option (\"FVO\"). The decrease was also attributable to a reclassification that the Company made of their personal unsecured loans from held-for-investment (\"HFI\") to held-for-sale (\"HFS\") in the third quarter of 2015 and credit losses attributed to these portfolios.

The primary factors contributing to the increase were:\nAmortization of intangibles increased $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a fourth quarter 2015 impairment of $11.7 million of the Company's indefinite-lived trade name. For further discussion on the impairment of this indefinite-lived trade name, please see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeposit insurance premiums expenses increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This variance was caused by a change in FDIC insurance premium rates and the assessment base for the Bank.\nThere were no losses on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $127.1 million of losses in the year ended December 31, 2014. This expense was primarily related to early termination fees incurred by the Company in association with the 2014 termination of legacy FHLB advances.\nThere was no impairment charges recorded on capitalized software during 2015. In the second quarter of 2014, an impairment of capitalized software charge of $97.5 million was recorded due to the restructuring of the Company's capitalized software.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $4.4 billion. For further discussion on this matter, see the section of the MD&A captioned \"Goodwill\".\nThe Company incurred an investment expense on affordable housing projects of $156 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. This expense was directly related to low income housing tax credit (\"LIHTC\") investments. This is attributed to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-01. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nINCOME TAX PROVISION\nAn income tax benefit of $671.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an income tax provision of $1.6 billion for the corresponding period in 2014. This resulted in effective tax rates of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 34.8% for the corresponding period in 2014.\nThe lower income tax provision in 2015 was primarily due to two drivers. In 2015, the Company recognized an impairment of the goodwill with respect to its investment in SC, which reduced the Company's deferred tax liability for the excess carrying value over its tax basis in the investment. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $982.9 million for the reduction in the deferred tax liability. In 2014, the Company recognized a tax expense of $917.5 million (approximately $841.7 million of which was deferred) on a book gain of $2.4 billion related to the Change in Control. The book gain was primarily due to the excess of fair value over the carrying value of the assets on SC's books at the time of the Change in Control. The $841.7 million of deferred tax liability would be recognized upon the Company's disposition of its interest in SC or if the goodwill associated with the Change in Control becomes impaired.\nThe lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven primarily by two components. The first was the 2015 impairment of goodwill related to the Company's investment in SC in the amount of $4.4 billion, which put the Company in a consolidated pretax loss position. The Company is not able to recognize a tax benefit for the impairment. In addition, the Company increased the reserve for income taxes under dispute with the United States for certain financing transactions by $104.2 million. Both of these items reduce the overall effective tax rate on a pretax base that is a loss.\nThe Company's effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nLINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS\nGeneral\nThe Company's segments at December 31, 2015 consisted of Retail Banking, Auto Finance & Business Banking, Real Estate and Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Banking (\"GCB\"), and SC. Prior to the closing of the IPO in January 2014, the Company accounted for its investment in SC under the equity method. Following the closing of the IPO, the Company consolidated the financial results of SC in the Company's financial statements, effective January 28, 2014.

Driven by growth in the special industries portfolio, the average balance of this segment's gross loans increased to $21.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $20.5 billion for the corresponding period in 2014. The average balance of deposits increased to $9.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $8.5 billion during the corresponding period in 2014, due to an increase in government banking deposits. Total non-interest income increased $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014 due to increased releases of recourse reserves during 2015. The provision for credit losses was $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to provision releases of $72.9 million for the corresponding period in 2014.

The average balance of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $15.5 billion, which was a decrease of $2.5 billion, compared to an average balance of $18.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. Overall, the decrease in interest income on investment securities and the decrease in the average investment balance were primarily attributable to the sales of certain MBS and CMO investments occurring in the second half of 2013 and additional sales in 2014.\nThe average tax equivalent yield of investment securities and interest-earning deposits was 2.20% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2.09% for the corresponding period in 2013. The increase from the prior year reflects increasing coupons on investment securities spurred by economic improvement.\nInterest Income on Loans\nInterest income on loans increased $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. The increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to the Change in Control.\nThe average balance of total loans was $73.3 billion with an average yield of 9.21% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $50.9 billion with an average yield of 3.88% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the average balance of total loans was primarily due to the Change in Control. The average balance of retail installment contracts and auto loans, which comprised a majority of the increase, was $19.9 billion with an average yield of 20.97% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $169.3 million with an average yield of 7.42% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nInterest Expense on Deposits and Related Customer Accounts\nInterest expense on deposits and related customer accounts decreased $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.

The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due to the Change in Control, which accounted for $437.1 million of total interest expense on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowed funds of $162.8 million for the Bank and the Company for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of the Bank's use of the proceeds from the sale of investment securities to pay off existing borrowed funds. The average balance of total borrowings was $34.5 billion with an average cost of 2.45% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to an average balance of $14.4 billion with an average cost of 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provision for credit losses is based on credit loss experience, growth or contraction of specific segments of the loan portfolio, and the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.5 billion compared to $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Of the increase, all but an immaterial amount is attributable to the RIC, unsecured and auto loan portfolios added from the Change in Control and subsequent origination activity within the same portfolios.\nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan and lease losses, beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>834,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,013,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>(109,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123,517\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer(3)\n</td> <td>(2,697,290\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(191,687\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total charge-offs\n</td> <td>(2,806,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(315,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>40,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer(3)\n</td> <td>1,167,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total recoveries\n</td> <td>1,207,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs, net of recoveries\n</td> <td>(1,599,287\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(215,982\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan and lease losses (1)\n</td> <td>2,576,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(2):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61,220\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan and lease losses, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,750,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>834,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, beginning of period\n</td> <td>220,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for unfunded lending commitments (1)\n</td> <td>(82,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on unfunded lending commitments\n</td> <td>(5,359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, end of period\n</td> <td>132,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total allowance for credit losses, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,883,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,054,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is the sum of the total provision for loan and lease losses and provision for unfunded lending commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The Other\u201d amount represents the impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses in connection with the sale of approximately $484.2 million of TDRs and NPLs classified as held-for-sale during the third quarter of 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Unallocated charge-offs and recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2014 are included in Consumer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

In connection with the Change in Control, the ratio of net loan charge-offs to average total loans increased to 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 0.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to the RIC and auto loan portfolio added from the Change in Control and the $1.4 billion of net charge-offs on that portfolio. Commercial loan net charge-offs as a percentage of average commercial loans was 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The consumer loan net charge-off ratio was 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in consumer charge-offs is primarily due to the credit quality of the RIC and auto loan portfolio added in the Change in Control, a majority of which are considered non-prime loans (defined by the Company as customers with Fair Isaac Corporation (\"FICO\") score of below 640). At December 31, 2014, 70% of the RIC and auto loan portfolio was comprised of non-prime loans.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial fees\n</td> <td>185,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income, net\n</td> <td>204,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments\n</td> <td>7,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>60,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital markets revenue\n</td> <td>51,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain recognized in earnings\n</td> <td>2,455,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease income\n</td> <td>798,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>540,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,680,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,088,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-interest income increased $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.

Mortgage banking income also includes gains or losses on the sale of mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, and MBS. Lastly, gains or losses on mortgage banking derivative and hedging transactions are also included in Mortgage banking income.\nMortgage banking revenue increased $82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the gain on sale of residential mortgage loans, as well as increased gains from hedging activities, partially offset by a decline in the fair value of MSRs.\nDuring 2012 and early 2013, there was significant volatility in mortgage interest rates which impacted the Company's mortgage banking revenue.\nSince mid-2013, these rates have stabilized, resulting in relative stability in mortgage banking fee fluctuations from rate changes.\nThe following table details certain residential mortgage rates for the Bank as of the dates indicated:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>30-Year Fixed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15-Year Fixed\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2013\n</td> <td>3.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2013\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2013\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>4.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>3.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther factors, such as portfolio sales, servicing, and re-purchases have continued to affect mortgage banking revenue.\nMortgage and multifamily servicing fees were relatively flat with a $1.2 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in the multifamily servicing portfolio. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company serviced multifamily real estate loans for the benefit of others totaling $2.9 billion and $4.6 billion.\nNet gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and related securities increased $90.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company sold $3.3 billion of loans for a gain of $144.9 million, compared to $4.0 billion of loans sold for a gain of $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe Company periodically sells qualifying mortgage loans to the FHLMC, GNMA and FNMA in return for MBS issued by those agencies. The Company records these transactions as sales when the transfers met all the accounting criteria for a sale. For those loans sold to the agencies for which the Company retains the servicing rights, the Company recognizes the servicing rights at fair value. These loans are also generally sold with standard representation and warranty provisions which the Company recognizes at fair value. Any difference between the carrying value of the transferred mortgage loans and the fair value of MBS, servicing rights, and representation and warranty reserves are recognized as gain or loss on sale.\nNet gains on sales of multifamily mortgage loans were $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the decrease in sales from 2013 to 2014.\nThe Company previously sold multifamily loans in the secondary market to FNMA while retaining servicing rights. In September 2009, the Bank elected to stop selling multifamily loans to FNMA and, since that time, has retained all production for the multifamily loan portfolio. Under the terms of the multifamily sales program with FNMA, the Company retained a portion of the credit risk associated with those loans. As a result of that agreement, the Company retains a 100% first loss position on each multifamily loan sold to FNMA under the program until the earlier to occur of (i) the aggregate approved losses on the multifamily loans sold to FNMA reaching the maximum loss exposure for the portfolio as a whole or (ii) all of the loans sold to FNMA under the program are fully paid off.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company serviced $2.6 billion and $4.3 billion, of loans for FNMA. These loans had a credit loss exposure of $152.8 million as of December 31, 2014 and $159.0 million as of December 31, 2013, and losses, if any, resulting from representation and warranty defaults would be in addition to the credit loss exposure. The servicing asset for these loans was completely amortized in 2012.\nThe Company has established a liability related to the fair value of the retained credit exposure for multifamily loans sold to FNMA. This liability represents the amount the Company estimated it would have to pay a third party to assume the retained recourse obligation. The estimated liability represents the present value of the estimated losses the portfolio is projected to incur based upon specific internal information and an industry-based default curve with a range of estimated losses. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had a liability of $40.7 million and $68.0 million, related to the fair value of the retained credit exposure for loans sold to FNMA under this program.\nNet gains/(losses) on hedging activities increased $51.0 million from a loss position in 2013 to a gain position for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to the mortgage rate environment and the significant decreases in the mortgage loan pipeline. Also contributing to the change was the Company's change in strategy during 2013 to hold mortgage loans originated as opposed to originating them for sale.\nNet gains/ (losses) from changes in MSR fair value decreased $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The carrying value of the related MSRs at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $145.0 million and $141.8 million, respectively. The MSR asset fair value decrease during 2014 was the result of decreased interest rates.\nMSR principal reductions resulted in a gain of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. The gain was due to the reduction in prepayments and mortgage refinancing.\nGain on Change in Control and Equity Method Investments\nPrior to the closing of the IPO in January 2014, the Company accounted for its investment in SC under the equity method. Following the closing of the IPO, the Company consolidated the financial results of SC in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements beginning with its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2014. In connection with the Change in Control, the Company recognized a gain of $2.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company recognized a gain of $7.8 million and $426.9 million on equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease of $419.0 million in equity method investment was due to the Change in Control, which resulted in accounting for SC as a consolidated subsidiary beginning January 28, 2014.\nBOLI\nBOLI income represents fluctuations in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain employees. The Bank is the beneficiary and the recipient of the insurance proceeds. Income from BOLI increased $3.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013.\nNet gain recognized in earnings\nNet gains recognized in earnings increased $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the Change in Control. For additional information on the Change in Control, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe net gain realized for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily comprised of the sale of state and municipal securities with a book value of $89.0 million for a gain of $5.2 million, the sale of corporate debt securities with a book value of $219.6 million for a gain of $4.8 million, and the sale of MBS with a book value of $579.4 million for a gain of $13.1 million. The net gain realized in for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily comprised of the sale of CMO with a book value of $4.1 billion for a gain of $69.0 million and the sale of corporate debt securities with a book value of $905.7 million for a gain of $34.7 million, offset by the OTTI charge of $63.6 million.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

This is a result of the Change in Control, as the Company had no lease income prior to the Change in Control. In addition, during 2014, through a flow agreement with SC, SBNA began originating prime and super prime Chrysler Capital consumer vehicle leases which created lease income for the Bank.\nAs disclosed within Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year, the Company re-classified subvention payments from an addition to Lease income to a reduction to Lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.\nMiscellaneous Income\nMiscellaneous income increased $527.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013.

First, the Company recognized tax expense of $917.5 million (approximately $841.7 million of which was deferred) on book gains of $2.4 billion related to the Change in Control. The book gain was primarily due to the excess of fair value over the carrying value of the assets on SC's books at the time of the Change in Control. The $841.7 million of deferred tax liability would be recognized upon the Company's disposition of its interest in SC or if the goodwill associated with the Change in Control becomes impaired. The income tax provision also increased by $654.9 million in 2014 due to the inclusion of the operating income of SC (as adjusted for purchase accounting) in SHUSA's pre-tax income, as a result of SC's consolidation into SHUSA's financial statements. When SC was previously presented as an equity method investment, SHUSA included SC's net income in SHUSA's presentation of pre-tax income. The impact of these two items was partially offset by a decline in SHUSA's (excluding SC) operating pre-tax earnings (excluding the gain recognized from the Change in Control) versus that of 2013, which caused a decrease in tax expense of $178.4 million.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe higher effective tax rate in 2014 was driven primarily by two factors related to the Change in Control. The consolidation of SC highlights the impact of double taxation on SC's operating income because the consolidated financial statements include the taxes paid by SC as well as the taxes accrued by SHUSA on its share of SCUSA's earnings. This was not reflected under equity-method accounting, which was applicable to SHUSA's 2013 consolidated financial statements. When compared to the results of 2013, the impact of this presentation resulted in an increase in the ETR of approximately 9%. In addition, the significant increase in the pre-tax income resulting from the Change in Control and the inclusion of the operating income of SC reduced the relative impact of favorable permanent tax differences (e.g., tax-exempt income and tax credits). When compared to 2013, the dilution effect of the higher pretax income from these two items on the favorable permanent items resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate (\"ETR\") of approximately 7%. The impact of these two items was partially offset by a decrease of approximately 3% related to state and local taxes, which was due to SC being taxable in jurisdictions with lower tax rates relative to SHUSA's historical filing group and changes in law in both New York State and Massachusetts, which had an overall favorable impact on the Company. It is expected that the Company's ETR will trend higher than for years 2013 and earlier due to the level of income produced by SC that contributes to the dilution effect described above.\nThe Company's effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nLINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS\nGeneral\nThe Company's segments at December 31, 2014 consisted of Retail Banking, Auto Finance & Alliances, Real Estate and Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Banking (\"GCB\"), and SC. Prior to the closing of the IPO in January 2014, the Company accounted for its investment in SC under the equity method. Following the closing of the IPO, the Company consolidated the financial results of SC in the Company's financial statements, effective January 28, 2014. For additional information with respect to the Company's reporting segments, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the first quarter of 2014, certain management and business line changes were announced as the Company reorganized its management reporting in order to improve its structure and focus to better align management teams and resources with the business goals of the Company and to provide enhanced customer service to its clients. These changes became effective for reporting purposes during the second quarter of 2014. Accordingly, the following changes were made within the Company's reportable segments:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Investment Services business unit was combined with the Retail Banking business unit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The CEVF line, formerly included in the Specialty and Government Banking business unit, was moved into the Auto Finance and Alliances business unit and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Specialty and Government Banking business unit was combined with the Real Estate and Commercial Banking business unit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccordingly, prior period information has been recast for comparability.\nResults Summary\nRetail Banking\nNet interest income decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The average balance of the Retail Banking segment's gross loans was $16.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $18.1 billion in 2013. The average balance of deposits was $31.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $32.9 billion for 2013. Total non-interest income increased $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the increase in the sales of mortgage loans and MBS. The provision for credit losses decreased $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Total expenses decreased $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to increased rent, increased grounds maintenance, re-stocking of branch materials in 2014 mainly due to the Bank's rebranding in 2013, and leasehold improvements in the branches.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal average assets for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $17.7 billion, compared to $18.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by the decreases within the mortgage loan portfolio.\nAuto Finance & Alliances\nNet interest income increased $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, driven primarily by the Chrysler Capital dealer floor-plan business line launched in the third quarter of 2013. Total average gross loans were $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $5.2 billion in 2013. Total non-interest income increased $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to the launch of the indirect leasing segment in 2014. The provision for credit losses decreased $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. Total expenses increased $238.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to the depreciation expense from operating lease assets associated with the launch of the indirect leasing business in 2014.\nTotal average assets were $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to the launch of the indirect leasing segment in 2014. Total average deposits were $6,741.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $6,377.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nReal Estate and Commercial Banking\nNet interest income increased $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Driven by growth in the multifamily portfolio, the average balance of this segment's gross loans increased to $20.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $19.6 billion in 2013. Growth in government banking drove the average balance of deposits to $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $6.8 billion in 2013. Total non-interest income decreased $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This decline was primarily related to a decrease of serviced portfolio reserve releases in 2014 compared to 2013. The release of credit losses was $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a release of $52.4 million for 2013. Total expenses decreased $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013.\nTotal average assets were $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $19.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGlobal Corporate Banking (GCB)\nNet interest income increased $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The average balance of this segment's gross loans was $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $7.1 billion in 2013, with the increase primarily driven by growth in the Large Corporate portfolio. The average balance of deposits was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $800.1 million in 2013. Total non-interest income increased $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The provision for credit losses increased $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Total expenses increased $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013.\nTotal average assets were $9.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $8.2 billion in 2013.\nOther\nNet interest income increased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Total non-interest income increased $152.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Total expenses increased $359.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013.\nAverage assets were $26.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $28.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSC\nFrom December 31, 2011 until January 28, 2014, SC was accounted for as an equity method investment. In 2014, SC's results of operations were consolidated with SHUSA. SC is managed as a separate business unit, with its own systems and processes, and is reported as a separate segment.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nMD&A is based on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments, and accordingly, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. However, the Company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. Management identified accounting for consolidation, business combinations, allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, goodwill, derivatives and hedging activities and income taxes as the Company's most critical accounting policies and estimates, in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Company's Audit Committee. Information concerning the Company's implementation and impact of new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") is discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidation\nThe purpose of consolidated financial statements is to present the results of operations and the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as if the consolidated group were a single economic entity. There is a presumption that consolidated financial statements are more meaningful than separate financial statements and that they are usually necessary for a fair presentation when one of the entities in the consolidated group directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest in the other entities.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nIn accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, the consolidated financial statements include any Voting Rights Entities (VOEs) in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and any VIEs for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company generally consolidates its VIEs if the Company has: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary). The Company generally consolidates its VOEs if the Company, directly or indirectly, owns more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the legal entity and the noncontrolling shareholders do not hold any substantive participating or controlling rights. VIEs and VOEs can include equity interests in corporations, and similar legal entities, and partnerships and similar legal entities, subordinated debt, derivative contracts, leases, service agreements, guarantees, standby letters of credit, loan commitments, and other contracts, agreements and financial instruments.\nUpon occurrence of certain significant events, as required by the VIE model the Company reassesses whether a legal entity in which the Company is involved with is a VIE. The reassessment also considers whether the Company has acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the legal entities with which the Company is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE, depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.\nThe Company uses the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if the Company has significant influence over the entity's operating and financing decisions but does not maintain control. Unconsolidated investments in VOEs or VIEs in which the Company has a voting or economic interest of less than 20% are generally carried at cost. These investments are included in \"Equity method investments\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Company's proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn July 2009, Santander contributed SC to the Company. SC's results of operations were consolidated with the Company's from January 2009 until December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, SC was accounted for as an equity-method investment. The Company continued to account for SC as an equity-method investment through December 31, 2013. Refer to Note 8, Equity Method Investments, Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the re-consolidation of SC effective in January 2014.\nIn accordance with ASC 810-10, Consolidation, the Company performs an analysis on a quarterly basis of each variable interest to determine if it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Those entities in which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary are consolidated, and, accordingly, the entity's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no VIEs for which the Company was considered the primary beneficiary.\nInvestments in non-consolidated affiliates, including VIEs, are generally accounted for using the equity-method.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and records the identifiable assets, liabilities and any non-controlling interests of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded prior to the finalization of a more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements will be adjusted retrospectively. All acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. The application of business combination principles including the determination of the fair value of the net assets acquired requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Please see related discussion under the caption Goodwill below.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nThe ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments represent management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of SHUSA's ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is regularly evaluated. This evaluation process is subject to several estimates and applications of judgment. Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb loan and lease losses takes into consideration the risks inherent in the loan portfolio, past loan and lease loss experience, loans that have loss potential, delinquency trends, economic conditions, the level of originations and other relevant factors. Management also considers loan quality, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, the amount of non-performing loans, and industry trends. Changes in these estimates could have a direct material impact on the provision for credit losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and/or could result in a change in the recorded allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the periods presented is included in the Credit Risk Management section of this MD&A.\nThe ALLL consists of two elements: (i) an allocated allowance, which is comprised of allowances established on loans individually evaluated for impairment (specific reserves) and loans collectively evaluated for impairment (general reserves) based on historical loan and lease loss experience adjusted for current trends general economic conditions and other risk factors, and (ii) an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Reserve levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly by Board-level committees.\nThe Company's allocated reserves are principally based on its various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee, and inputs are reviewed periodically by the Company's internal audit function. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Committee.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's unallocated allowance is no more than 5% of the overall allowance. This is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the Company's entire loan and lease portfolio. Imprecisions include loss factors inherent in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance, as well as potential variability in estimates. Period-to-period changes in the Company's historical unallocated allowance for loan and lease loss positions are considered in light of these factors.\nLoan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructuring\nTDRs are loans that have been modified for which the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to customers to both meet the needs of the customers and maximize the ultimate recovery of the loan. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified involving a concession that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. Commercial and consumer TDRs are generally placed on non-accrual status until the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is reasonably assured and a sustained period of repayment performance has been achieved (typically defined as six months for a monthly amortizing loan). RIC TDRs are generally placed on non-accrual status until they become 60 days or less past due. All costs incurred by the Company in connection with a TDR are expensed as incurred. The TDR classification remains on the loan until it is paid in full or liquidated.\nCommercial Loan TDRs\nAll of the Company's commercial loan modifications are based on the circumstances of the individual customer, including specific customers' complete relationship with the Company. Loan terms are modified to meet each borrower's specific circumstances at a point in time and may allow for modifications such as term extensions, interest rate reductions, etc. Modifications for commercial loan TDRs generally, although not always, result in bifurcation of the original loan into A and B notes. The A note is restructured to allow for an upgraded risk rating and return to accrual status after a sustained period of payment performance has been achieved (typically six months for monthly payment schedules). The B note, if any, is structured as a deficiency note and the balance is charged off but the debt is usually not forgiven. As TDRs, they will be subject to analysis for specific reserves by either calculating the present value of expected future cash flows or, if collateral-dependent, calculating the fair value of the collateral less its estimated cost to sell. The TDR classification will remain on the loan until it is paid in full or liquidated.\nConsumer Loan TDRs\nThe primary modification program for the Company's residential mortgage and home equity portfolios is a proprietary program designed to keep customers in their homes and, when appropriate, prevent them from entering into foreclosure. The program is available to all customers facing a financial hardship regardless of their delinquency status. The main goal of the modification program is to review the customer's entire financial condition to ensure that the proposed modified payment solution is affordable according to a specific debt-to-income (\"DTI\") ratio range. The main modification benefits of the program allow for term extensions, interest rate reductions, and/or deferment of principal. The Company reviews each customer on a case-by-case basis to determine which benefit or combination of benefits will be offered to achieve the target DTI range.\nConsumer TDRs in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are generally placed on non-accrual status until the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is reasonably assured and a sustained period of repayment performance has been achieved (typically six months for a monthly amortizing loan). Any loan that has remained current for the six months immediately prior to modification will remain on accrual status after the modification is implemented. The TDR classification will remain on the loan until it is paid in full or liquidated.\nIn addition to those identified as TDRs above, accounting guidance also requires loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be considered TDRs and collateral-dependent, regardless of delinquency status. These loans must be written down to fair market value and classified as non-accrual/non-performing for the remaining life of the loan.\nFor the Company's other consumer portfolios, including RIC and auto loans, the terms of the modifications generally include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan at a rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk or an extension of the maturity date.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRICs were a new portfolio for the Company in 2014 as a result of the Change in Control. The RIC and auto loan portfolio is primarily comprised of nonprime loans which lead to a higher rate of modifications and deferrals, and thus a higher volume of TDRs, than other portfolios. Loan portfolios acquired as part of a business combination like the Change in Control cannot be designated as TDRs under U.S. GAAP at the Change in Control date. As a result, the increase is primarily driven by RICs and auto loans originated prior to the Change in Control date which received their first modification, deferral greater than 90 days or second deferral subsequent to the Change in Control date during the reporting period. As a percentage of the RIC and auto loan portfolio recorded investment, there have been no significant increases in modification or deferral activity during the reporting period. The increased TDR activity at SHUSA may continue until the loan portfolios acquired as part of the Change in Control runoff.\nIn accordance with our policies and guidelines, the Company, at times, offer extensions (deferrals) to consumers on our RICs, whereby the consumer is allowed to defer a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan. More than 90% of deferrals granted are for two payments. Our policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral that may be granted to one deferral every six months, regardless of the length of any prior deferral. The maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile RICs is eight, while some marine and recreational vehicle contracts have a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term. Additionally, we generally limit the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received. During the deferral period, we continue to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement.\nAt the time a deferral is granted, all delinquent amounts may be deferred or paid, resulting in the classification of the loan as current and therefore not considered a delinquent account. Thereafter, such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account.\nThe Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio.\nChanges in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts for loans classified as TDRs used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and related provision for loan and lease losses. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan and lease losses and related provision for loan and lease losses.\nTDR Impact to Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is established to recognize losses inherent in funded loans intended to be held for investment that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Prior to loans being placed in TDR status, the Company generally measures its allowance under a loss contingency methodology in which consumer loans with similar risk characteristics are pooled and loss experience information is monitored for credit risk and deterioration with statistical tools considering factors such as delinquency, loan-to-value (\"LTV\") and credit scores.\nUpon TDR modification, the Company generally measures impairment based on a present value of expected future cash flows methodology considering all available evidence using the effective interest rate or fair value of collateral. The amount of the required valuation allowance is equal to the difference between the loan's impaired value and the recorded investment.\nWhen a consumer TDR subsequently defaults, the Company generally measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if applicable, less its estimated cost to sell.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTypically, commercial loans whose terms are modified in a TDR will have been identified as impaired prior to modification and accounted for generally using a present value of expected future cash flows methodology, unless the loan is considered collateral-dependent. Loans considered collateral-dependent are measured for impairment based on their fair values of the collateral less its estimated cost to sell. Accordingly, upon TDR modification or if a TDR modification subsequently defaults, the allowance methodology remains unchanged.\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather are subject to periodic impairment testing.\nAs more fully described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. The Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 1, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As of December 31, 2015, the reporting units with assigned goodwill were Retail Banking, Auto Finance and Business Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Corporate and Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Banking, and SC.\nUnder ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, an entity's goodwill impairment analysis must be completed in two steps unless the entity determines, based on certain qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, including goodwill, and that no impairment exists. In that case the two-step process may be bypassed. It is worth noting that an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the preceding qualitative assessment (often referred to as \"Step 0\") for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test. The Company did not apply the provisions of Step 0 in its 2015 goodwill impairment analysis.\nThe first step of ASC 350 (\"Step 1\") analysis requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including its allocated goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment exists and a second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any, for that reporting unit. The Company utilizes the market approach to determine the fair value of its SC reporting unit as it is a publicly traded company that has a single reporting unit. Determining the fair value of the remaining reporting units requires significant valuation inputs, assumptions, and estimates.\nThe Company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a risk-based capital approach. Certain of the Company's assets are assigned to a Corporate / Other category. These assets are related to the Company's corporate-only programs, such as BOLI, and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit.\nWhen required, the second step of testing (\"Step 2\") involves calculating the implied fair value of each of the affected reporting units. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that is recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired. If the implied fair value of goodwill is in excess of the reporting unit's allocated goodwill amount, then no impairment charge is required. If the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. A recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill impairment testing involves management's judgment, to the extent that it requires an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value. This is performed using widely-accepted valuation techniques, such as the guideline public company market approach (earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies), the market capitalization approach (share price of the reporting unit and control premium of comparable public companies), and the income approach (the discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") method).\nThe Company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units. Several factors are taken into account, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, and market data.\nThe guideline public company market approach (\"market approach\") included earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the Company's reporting units. In addition, the market capitalization plus control premium approach was applied to the Company's SC reporting unit as the SC reporting unit is a publicly traded subsidiary whose securities are traded in an active market.\nIn connection with the market capitalization plus control premium approach applied to the Company's SC reporting unit, the Company used SC's stock price as of the date of the annual impairment analysis. The Company also considered historical auto loan industry transactions and control premiums over the last three years in determining the control premium.\nThe DCF method of the income approach incorporated the reporting units' forecasted cash flows, including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts. The discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units' cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model. Significant inputs to this model include a risk-free rate of return, beta (which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit), market equity risk premium, and, in certain cases, additional premium for size and/or unsystematic Company specific risk factors. The Company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets. The Company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. The Company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, so actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nAll of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impacts the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units include such items as:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unexpected regulatory changes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to the Financial Condition, Goodwill section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further details on the Company's Goodwill, including the results of Management's goodwill impairment analyses.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nSHUSA and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments as part of the risk management process to manage risk associated with financial assets and liabilities and mortgage banking activities, to assist commercial banking customers with risk management strategies, and for certain other market exposures.\nDerivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk (such as interest rate risk) are considered fair value hedges. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. The Company formally documents the relationships of qualifying hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value hedges that are highly effective are accounted for by recording the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the related hedged asset, liability or firm commitment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the corresponding income or expense recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the fair value of the derivative is recorded as an other asset or other liability. Actual cash receipts or payments and related amounts accrued during the period on derivatives included in a fair value hedge relationship are recorded as adjustments to the income or expense associated with the hedged asset or liability.\nCash flow hedges that are highly effective are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset or liability, with a corresponding charge or credit, net of tax, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholder's equity on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Where certain cash flow hedging relationships have been terminated, the Company continues to defer the net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassifies it into Interest expense as the future cash flows occur, unless it becomes probable that the future cash flows will not occur.\nThe portion of gains and losses on derivative instruments not considered highly effective in hedging the change in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item, or derivatives not designated in hedging relationships, are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, the Company had cash flow and fair value hedges recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Other assets\u201d or Other liabilities,\u201d as applicable. For both fair value and cash flow hedges, certain assumptions and forecasts related to the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange and credit risk on the fair value of the derivative and the item being hedged must be documented at the inception of the hedging relationship to demonstrate that the derivative instrument will be effective in hedging the designated risk. If these assumptions or forecasts do not accurately reflect subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument or the designated item being hedged, the Company might be required to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for that derivative instrument. Once hedge accounting is terminated, all subsequent changes in the fair market value of the derivative instrument must be recorded in earnings, possibly resulting in greater volatility in earnings. If outstanding derivative positions that qualified for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2015 were no longer considered effective, and thus did not qualify for hedge accounting, the impact in 2015 would have been to lower pre-tax earnings by a net of $14.1 million.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply or will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse or be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance will be established if the Company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires periodic analysis of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and when the deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. Consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets. The critical assumptions used in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis were as follows: (a) the expectations of future earnings (b) estimates of the Company's long-term annual growth rate, based on the Company's long-term economic outlook in the U.S.; (c) estimates of the dividend income payout ratio from the Company's consolidated subsidiary, SC, based on the current policies and practices of SC; (d) estimates of book income to tax income differences, based on the analysis of historical differences and the historical timing of the reversal of temporary differences; (e) the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid; (f) estimates of tax credits to be earned on current investments, based on the Company's evaluation of the credits applicable to each investment; (g) experience with operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards not expiring unused; (h) estimates of applicable state tax rates based on current/most recent enacted tax rates and state apportionment calculations; (i) tax planning strategies and (j) current tax laws. Significant judgment is required to assess future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company bases its expectations of future earnings, which are used to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, on financial performance forecasts of its operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees. The budgets and estimates used in these forecasts are approved by the Company's management, and the assumptions underlying the forecasts are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as necessary based on current developments or when new information becomes available. The updates made and the variances between the Company's forecasts and its actual performance have not been significant enough to alter the Company's conclusions with regard to the realizability of its deferred tax asset including the effect of the SC Transaction that occurred in 2011 and the Change in Control that occurred in the first quarter of 2014. The Company continues to forecast sufficient taxable income to fully realize its current deferred tax assets. Forecasted taxable income is subject to changes in overall market and global economic conditions.\nIn establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws in the U.S., its states and municipalities, and abroad. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending on changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company reviews its tax balances quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Interest and penalties on income tax payments are included within income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the related tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the Company's income taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLOAN PORTFOLIO\nThe Company's loan portfolio(1) consisted of the following at the

In the commercial loans (excluding multifamily loans) portfolio, the portfolio has increased $8.5 billion or 37.2%, primarily attributable to organic growth in the C&I portfolio over the last two years of $5.7 billion, with the primary driver in the C&I portfolio being the GCB segment. In the multifamily portfolio, the portfolio has increased $2.3 billion or 32.9%, primarily attributable to repurchases from FNMA of $2.2 billion. For the consumer portfolios, consumer loans secured by real estate have decreased $5.9 billion or 31.8%, primarily attributable to securitization transactions of $3.8 billion. Consumer loans not secured by real estate have increased $26.1 billion or 799.0%, primarily attributable to the Change in Control at SC in 2014 when $20.9 billion of RIC and auto loans and $1.0 billion of personal unsecured loans were consolidated by the Company.\nCommercial\nCommercial loans (excluding multifamily loans) increased approximately $3.3 billion, or 11.9%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.

This increase from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the $1.4 billion repurchase of FNMA loans during the third quarter of 2015, offset by loan repayment and runoff activity exceeding originations by $677.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents the contractual maturity of the Company's commercial loans at December 31, 2015:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, MATURING\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>In One Year\nOr Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,828,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,102,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,791,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,722,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,474,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,726,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,348,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,548,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>775,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,712,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,950,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,438,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,078,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,541,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,089,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,709,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans with:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,185,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,383,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,799,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,368,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,892,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,158,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,290,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,341,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,078,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,541,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,089,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,709,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes LHFS.\nConsumer\nConsumer loans secured by real estate decreased $561.6 million, or 4.3%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The primary drivers of the decrease from December 31, 2014 were related to the Residential Mortgage portfolio, specifically loan sales of $2.5 billion and runoff of $1.2 billion exceeding originations of $3.2 billion.\nThe consumer loan portfolio not secured by real estate increased $2.9 billion, or 10.9%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The primary driver of the increase from December 31, 2014 was the RIC and auto loan portfolio, specifically originations of $22.1 billion exceeding paydowns and charge-off activity of $11.7 billion and sales of $7.9 billion.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, 69.0% of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio was nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a Fair Isaac Corporation (\"FICO\") score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. While underwriting guidelines were designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, the nonprime loans, nonetheless, will experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decrease consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weakening collateral values and increasing losses in the event of default. Because SC's historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as FICO, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. We experienced a default rate of 8.3% for nonprime RIC and auto loans and 2.9% for prime RIC and auto loans during the period ended December 31, 2015.\nIn early 2015, we increased our origination volume of RICs to borrowers with limited credit experience, such as those with less than 36 months of credit history or less than four trade lines. For these borrowers, many of whom do not have a FICO\u00ae score, other factors such as the LexisNexis risk view score, loan-to-value ratio, and payment-to-income ratio are utilized to assign an internal credit score. Our risk-based pricing methodology generally captures these credit bureau attributes in establishing a risk appropriate annual percentage rate at the time of origination. Origination volume of RICs with less than four trade lines and less than 36 months of credit history was $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Remaining unpaid principal balance of these loans was $4.8 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our credit loss allowance forecasting models are not calibrated for this higher concentration of RICs with limited bureau information and, accordingly, as of December 31, 2015, we recorded a qualitative adjustment of $158 million, increasing the allowance ratio on individually acquired retail installment contracts by 0.6% of unpaid principal balance. This adjustment was necessary to increase the estimated credit loss allowance for additional charge offs expected on this portfolio, based on the loss performance information available to date, which evidences higher losses in the first months after origination for these RICs in comparison to RICs with standard bureau attributes. This qualitative adjustment was informed by the deteriorating loss trends of the 2015 vintages over a subsequent twelve month forecast horizon. Under assumed scenarios if losses from such 2015 vintages were to increase by 10% and 20%, the allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $130 million and $261 million, respectively.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Score Range(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail installment contracts and auto loans(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail installment contracts and auto loans(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Standard file(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Standard file(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Standard file(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Standard file(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>No FICOs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td><600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>600-639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>640-679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Consists primarily of loans for which credit scores are not considered in the ALLL model.\n(2) Credit scores updated quarterly.\n(3) RICs loans include $905.7 million and $45.4 million of LHFS at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, that do not have an allowance.\n(4) Defined as borrowers with greater than 36 months of credit history or four or more trade lines\n(5) Defined as borrowers with less than 36 months of credit history or less than four trade lines.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

All of the Company's RICs and auto loans are fixed rate loans.\nNonprime RICs and personal unsecured loans have a higher inherent risk of loss than prime loans. The Company records an allowance for loan and lease losses to cover its estimate of inherent losses on its RIC incurred as of the balance sheet date on its RICs. As of September 30, 2015, SC's personal unsecured portfolio was transferred to held for sale and thus does not have a related allowance. The inclusion of SC's nonprime loans within the Company's loan portfolio effective upon the Change in Control in 2014, among other things, resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans held for investment from 2.3% at December 31, 2014 to 3.9% at December 31, 2015.\nAs a result of the strategic evaluation of SC's personal lending portfolio, in the third quarter of 2015, SC began reviewing strategic alternatives for exiting its personal loan portfolios. In connection with this review, on October 9, 2015, SC delivered a 90-day notice of termination of its loan purchase agreement with LendingClub. On February 1, 2016, it completed the sale of substantially all of our LendingClub loans to a third-party buyer at an immaterial premium to par value. The portfolio was comprised of personal installment loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThe other significant personal lending relationship is with Bluestem. Management continues to perform in accordance with the terms and operative provisions of the agreements under which we are obligated to purchase personal revolving loans originated by Bluestem for a term ending in 2020, or 2022 if extended at Bluestem's option. These and other, smaller, revolving loan portfolios are carried as held for sale in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has recorded lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on these portfolios, and there may be further such adjustments required in future periods' financial statements. Management is currently evaluating alternatives for the Bluestem portfolio.\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\nExtending credit to customers exposes the Company to credit risk, which is the risk that contractual principal and interest due on loans will not be collected due to the inability or unwillingness of the borrower to repay the loan. The Company manages credit risk in its loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards, guidelines, and limitations established by the Company's Board of Directors as set forth in its Board-approved Risk Tolerance Statement. Written loan policies establish underwriting standards, lending limits, and other standards or limits deemed necessary and prudent. Various approval levels based on the amount of the loan and other key credit attributes have also been established. In order to ensure consistency and quality in accordance with the Company's credit and governance standards, authority to approve loans is shared jointly between the businesses and the credit risk group. Loans over certain dollar thresholds require approval by the Company's credit committees, with higher balance loans requiring approval by more senior level committees.\nThe Credit Risk Review group conducts ongoing independent reviews of the credit quality of the Company's loan portfolios and credit management processes to ensure the accuracy of the risk ratings and adherence to established policies and procedures, verify compliance with applicable laws and regulations, provide objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, and ensure that proper documentation exists. The results of these periodic reviews are reported to business line management, Risk Management and the Audit Committee of both the Company and the Bank. The Company maintains a classification system for loans that identifies those requiring a higher level of monitoring by management because of one or more factors, including borrower performance, business conditions, industry trends, the nature of the collateral, collateral margin, economic conditions, or other factors. Loan credit quality is subject to scrutiny by line management, credit risk professionals, and Internal Audit.\nThe following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and addresses SHUSA's strategies for managing the related credit risk. Additional credit risk management related considerations are discussed further in the \"Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\" section of this MD&A.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial Loans\nCommercial loans principally represent commercial real estate loans (including multifamily loans), loans to commercial and industrial customers, and automotive dealer floor plan loans. Credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing and expected economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk SHUSA is willing to assume. To manage credit risk when extending commercial credit, the Company focuses on assessing the borrower's capacity and willingness to repay and obtaining sufficient collateral. Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by the borrower's assets and by personal guarantees. Commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within the Mid-Atlantic, New York, and New England market areas and are secured by real estate at specified loan-to-value (\"LTV\") ratios and often by a guarantee of the borrower.\nManagement closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that significant credit concentrations by borrowers or industries are mitigated. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, 22.3% and 20.1%, respectively, of the commercial loan portfolio, excluding multifamily, was unsecured.\nConsumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\nCredit risk in the direct and indirect consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels, the creditworthiness of the borrower, and collateral values. In the home equity loan portfolio, combined loan-to-value (\"CLTV\") ratios are generally limited to 90% for both first and second liens. SHUSA originates and purchases fixed-rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that are secured by the underlying 1-4 family residential properties. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-equity ratios, credit scores, and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than 80%. Residential mortgage loans originated or purchased in excess of an 80% LTV ratio are generally insured by private mortgage insurance, unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the Federal, state, or local government. SHUSA also utilizes underwriting standards which comply with those of FHLMC or FNMA. Credit risk is further reduced, since a portion of the Company's fixed-rate mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse.\nConsumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\nThe Company's consumer loans not secured by real estate include acquired RIC from manufacturer franchised dealers in connection with their sale of used and new automobiles and trucks as well as acquired consumer marine and RV and credit card loans. Credit risk is mitigated to the extent possible through early and aggressive collection practices, which includes the repossession of vehicles.\nCollections\nThe Company closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality. Collection efforts generally begin within 15 days after a loan payment is missed by attempting to contact all borrowers and offer a variety of loss mitigation alternatives. If these attempts fail, the Company will attempt to gain control of any and all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses. While liquidation and recovery efforts continue, officers continue to work with the borrowers, if appropriate, to recover all money owed to the Company. The Company monitors delinquency trends at 30, 60, and 90 days past due. These trends are discussed at monthly management Credit Risk Review Committee meetings and at the Company's and the Bank's Board of Directors' meetings.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

Potential problem loans are loans not currently classified as NPLs for which management has doubts about the borrowers' ability to comply with the present repayment terms. These assets are principally loans delinquent more than 30 days but less than 90 days. Potential problem commercial loans totaled approximately $57.1 million and $71.8 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nNon-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and leases (\"NPLs\"), which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, other real estate owned (\"OREO\") properties, and other repossessed assets. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is reversed, with accruals charged against earnings. The Company generally places all commercial loans and consumer loans secured by real estate on non-performing status at 90 days past due for interest, principal or maturity, or earlier if it is determined that the collection of principal or interest on the loan is in doubt. For certain individual portfolios, including the RIC portfolio, non-performing status will begin at 60 days past due. Personal unsecured loans, including credit cards, generally continue to accrue interest until they are 180 days delinquent, at which point they are charged-off and all interest is removed from interest income.\nIn general, when the borrower's ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer believed to be in doubt, the loan or lease is returned to accrual status. Generally, commercial loans categorized as non-performing remain in non-performing status until the payment status is current and an event occurs that fully remediates the impairment or the loan demonstrates a sustained period of performance without a past due event, and there is reasonable assurance as to the collectability of all amounts due. Within the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, the accrual status is generally systematically driven, so that if the customer makes a payment that brings the loan below 90 days past due, the loan automatically returns to accrual status.\nCommercial\nCommercial NPLs decreased $25.0 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, commercial NPLs accounted for 0.5% of total commercial loans, compared to 0.6% of total commercial loans at December 31, 2014. The decrease in commercial NPLs was primarily attributable to a decrease of NPLs in the CRE portfolio of $54.6 million, due to continued improvement in credit quality, and offset by an increase of $30.1 million in the C&I portfolio, due to the energy sector.\nConsumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\nThe following table shows NPLs compared to total loans outstanding for the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential mortgages (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Home equity loans and lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Residential mortgages (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Home equity loans and lines of credit\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,467,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,146,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,969,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,206,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPLs as a percentage of total loans\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPLs in foreclosure status\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes LHFS\nThe NPL ratio is significantly higher for the Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio compared to its consumer loans secured by real estate portfolio due to a number of factors, including: the prolonged workout and foreclosure resolution processes for residential mortgage loans; differences in risk profiles; and mortgage loans located outside the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States.\nResolution challenges with low foreclosure sales continue to impact both residential mortgage and consumer loans secured by real estate portfolio NPL balances, but foreclosure inventory decreased quarter-over-quarter. The foreclosure moratorium was lifted and activity resumed in the fourth quarter of 2011, but delays in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts limited the decline in NPL balances and contributed to a higher NPL ratio. As of December 31, 2015, foreclosures in all states except Delaware and Washington, D.C. were moving forward. Both Delaware and Washington, D.C. are delayed due to new legal complexities surrounding documentation required to initiate new foreclosure proceedings.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

These final rules require lenders to offer loan modification terms to certain borrowers prior to proceeding with foreclosure, unless the lender is able to prove that the modification would result in greater losses for the bank or that the borrower has rejected the offer. Lenders are also required to send notice to borrowers regarding their right to request a modification.

Exclusive of Chapter 7 bankruptcy NPL accounts, approximately 83.9% of the 90+ day delinquent loan balances in the residential mortgage portfolio are secured by a first lien, while only 50.7% of the 90+ day delinquent loan balances in the consumer real estate secured portfolio are secured by a first lien. Consumer real estate secured NPLs may get charged off more quickly due to the lack of equity to foreclose from a second lien position. The Alt-A segment consists of loans with limited documentation requirements and a portion of which were originated through independent parties (\"Brokers\") outside the Bank's geographic footprint.

Alt-A mortgage originations were discontinued in 2008 and have continued to run off at an average rate of 1.9% per month. Alt-A NPL balances represented 64.6% of the total residential mortgage loan portfolio NPL balance at the end of the first quarter of 2009, when the portfolio was placed in run-off, compared to 26.7% at December 31, 2015. As the Alt-A segment runs off and higher quality residential mortgages are added to the portfolio, the shift in product mix is expected to lower NPL balances.\nConsumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\nRICs and amortizing term personal loans are classified as non-performing when they are greater than 60 days past due with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the fair value option, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to a performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off.\nNPLs in the consumer loans not secured by real estate portfolio increased $140.9 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, non-performing consumer loans not secured by real estate accounted for 3.8% of total consumer loans not secured by real estate, compared to 3.7% of total consumer loans not secured by real estate at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio of $144.7 million. This NPL increase is due to the rise of nonprime loans, as a percentage of the portfolio, which have a higher default rate than prime loans.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferments of principal.\nTDRs are generally placed in nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, TDRs may return to accrual status after demonstrating at least six consecutive months of sustained payments following modification, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. For the RIC portfolio, loans may return to accrual status when the balance is remediated to current status. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status.\nThe following table summarizes TDRs at the dates indicated:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>134,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail installment contracts and auto loan\n</td> <td>3,454,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,697,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>90,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total performing\n</td> <td>3,807,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,041,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>66,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>66,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail installment contracts and auto loan\n</td> <td>422,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>48,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing\n</td> <td>603,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,411,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,385,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerforming TDRs totaled $3.8 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to December 31, 2014.

The increase is primarily attributable to the Company receiving refreshed chapter 7 bankruptcy data related to the residential mortgage portfolio, which added $41.4 million to the TDR portfolio in 2015.\nRIC\nRICs were a new portfolio for the Company in 2014 as a result of the Change in Control. The RIC and auto loan portfolio is primarily comprised of nonprime loans (69.0% at December 31, 2015) which lead to a higher rate of modifications and deferrals, and thus a higher volume of TDRs, than other portfolios. Total RIC and auto loan portfolio TDRs (performing and non-performing) comprised 8.2% of the Company's total RIC and auto loan portfolio at December 31, 2014 and 15.1% at December 31, 2015. Loan portfolios acquired as part of a business combination like the Change in Control cannot be designated as TDRs under U.S. GAAP at the Change in Control date. As a result, the increase is primarily driven by RICs and auto loans originated prior to the Change in Control date which received their first modification, deferral greater than 90 days or second deferral subsequent to the Change in Control date during the reporting period. As a percentage of the RIC and auto loan portfolio recorded investment, there have been no significant increases in modification or deferral activity during the reporting period. The increased TDR activity at SHUSA may continue until the loan portfolios acquired as part of the Change in Control runoff.\nIn accordance with its policies and guidelines, the Company, at times, offer payment deferrals to borrowers on its retail installment contracts, under which the consumer is allowed to move up to three delinquent payments to the end of the loan. The policies and guidelines limit the number and frequency of deferrals that may be granted to one deferral every six months and eight months over the life of a loan. Additionally, the Company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received. During the deferral period, the Company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement.\nAt the time a deferral is granted, all delinquent amounts may be deferred or paid, resulting in the classification of the loan as current and therefore not considered a delinquent account. Thereafter, the account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account.\nThe Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio.\nChanges in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts for loans classified as TDRs used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and related provision for loan and lease losses. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan and lease losses and related provision for loan and lease losses.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The increase is primarily attributable to the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio, including new TDRs of $31.8 million exceeding payments and charge-offs of $16.6 million. If a customer's financial difficulty is not temporary, the Company may agree, or be required by a bankruptcy court, to grant a modification involving one or a combination of the following: a reduction in interest rate, a reduction in the loan's principal balance, or an extension of the maturity date. The servicer also may grant concessions on the Company's revolving personal loans in the form of principal or interest rate reductions or payment plans.\nTDR activity in the personal loan and other consumer portfolios was negligible to overall TDR activity.\nDelinquencies\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's delinquencies consisted of the following:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>Commercial Loans\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>Commercial Loans\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Delinquencies\n</td> <td>$390,714\n</td> <td>$3,904,809\n</td> <td>$159,501\n</td> <td>$4,455,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$488,911\n</td> <td>$3,589,648\n</td> <td>$175,459\n</td> <td>$4,254,018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loans(1)\n</td> <td>$12,614,668\n</td> <td>$29,350,173\n</td> <td>$40,709,731\n</td> <td>$82,674,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$13,176,289\n</td> <td>$26,467,316\n</td> <td>$36,640,761\n</td> <td>$76,284,366\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delinquencies as a % of Loans\n</td> <td>3.1%\n</td> <td>13.3%\n</td> <td>0.4%\n</td> <td>5.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7%\n</td> <td>13.6%\n</td> <td>0.5%\n</td> <td>5.6%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes LHFS\nOverall, total delinquencies have increased by $201.0 million or 4.7% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Consumer loans secured by real estate delinquencies have decreased $98.2 million primarily due to improvements in credit quality in the residential mortgage portfolio. Consumer loans not secured by real estate delinquencies have increased $315.2 million primarily due to the increase in nonprime accounts in the RIC and auto loan portfolio. Commercial delinquencies have decreased $16.0 million primarily due to overall improvements in credit quality.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (\"ACL\")\nThe ACL is maintained at levels that management considers adequate to provide for losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. Management's evaluation takes into consideration the risks inherent in the portfolio, past loan and lease loss experience, specific loans with loss potential, geographic and industry concentrations, delinquency trends, the level of originations, credit quality metrics such as Fair Isaac Corporation ( FICO\u201d) and combined loan-to-value ( CLTV\u201d), internal risk ratings, economic conditions and other relevant factors. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The increase in the overall ACL was primarily attributable to SC's personal unsecured loan portfolios being reclassified as held-for-sale, as well as the lower of cost or fair value adjustments on certain RICs and auto loans. This is also the primary driver behind the increase in the ACL attributed to consumer loans. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses allocated to commercial loans was, in part, attributed to additional reserves recorded on the Company's energy portfolio citing current economic conditions impacting this sector.\nManagement regularly monitors the condition of the Company's portfolio, considering factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquencies and NPLs, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, the experience and ability of staff, and regional and national economic conditions and trends.\nThe risk factors inherent in the ACL are continuously reviewed and revised by management when conditions indicate that the estimates initially applied are different from actual results. The Company also performs a comprehensive analysis of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In addition, a review of allowance levels based on nationally published statistics is conducted quarterly.\nThe factors supporting the ACL do not diminish the fact that the entire ACL is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio. The Company's principal focus is to ensure the adequacy of the total ACL.\nThe ACL is subject to review by banking regulators. The Company's primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the ACL and make assessments regarding its adequacy and the methodology employed in its determination.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial\nFor the commercial loan portfolio excluding small business loans (businesses with annual sales of up to $3.0 million), the Company has specialized credit officers, a monitoring unit, and workout units that identify and manage potential problem loans. Changes in management factors, financial and operating performance, company behavior, industry factors and external events and circumstances are evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine whether potential impairment is evident and additional analysis is needed. For the commercial loan portfolios, risk ratings are assigned to each loan to differentiate risk within the portfolio, reviewed on an ongoing basis by credit risk management and revised, if needed, to reflect the borrower's current risk profile and the related collateral position. The risk ratings consider factors such as financial condition, debt capacity and coverage ratios, market presence and quality of management. Generally, credit officers reassess a borrower's risk rating on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if warranted. This reassessment process is managed by credit officers and is overseen by the Credit Monitoring group to ensure consistency and accuracy in risk ratings, as well as the appropriate frequency of risk rating reviews by the Company's credit officers. The Company's Credit Risk Review Committee assesses whether the Company's Credit Risk Review Framework and, risk management guidelines established by the Company's Board and applicable laws and regulations are being followed, and reports key findings and relevant information to the Board. The Company's Credit Risk Review group regularly performs loan reviews and assesses the appropriateness of assigned risk ratings. When credits are downgraded below a certain level, the Company's Workout Department becomes responsible for managing the credit risk. Risk rating actions are generally reviewed formally by one or more credit committees depending on the size of the loan and the type of risk rating action being taken. Detailed analyses are completed that support the risk rating and management's strategies for the customer relationship going forward.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. An insignificant delay (e.g., less than 90 days) or insignificant shortfall in the amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired. Impaired commercial loans are comprised of all TDRs plus non-accrual loans in excess of $1 million that are not TDRs. In addition, the Company may perform a specific reserve analysis on loans that fail to meet this threshold if the nature of the collateral or business conditions warrant. The Company performs a specific reserve analysis on certain loans regardless of loan size. If a loan is identified as impaired and is collateral-dependent, an initial appraisal is obtained to provide a baseline to determine the property's fair market value. The frequency of appraisals depends on the type of collateral being appraised. If the collateral value is subject to significant volatility (due to location of the asset, obsolescence, etc.), an appraisal is obtained more frequently. At a minimum, updated appraisals for impaired loans are obtained within a 12-month period if the loan remains outstanding for that period of time.\nIf a loan is identified as impaired and is not collateral-dependent, impairment is measured based on a discounted cash flow methodology.\nWhen the Company determines that the value of an impaired loan is less than its carrying amount, the Company recognizes impairment through a provision estimate or a charge-off to the allowance. Management performs these assessments on at least a quarterly basis. For commercial loans, a charge-off is recorded when a loan, or a portion thereof, is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance on the Company's books as an asset is not warranted. Charge-offs are recorded on a monthly basis, and partially charged-off loans continue to be evaluated on at least a quarterly basis, with additional charge-offs or loan and lease loss provisions taken on the remaining loan balance, if warranted, utilizing the same criteria.\nThe portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses related to the commercial portfolio was $433.5 million at December 31, 2015 (1.1% of commercial loans held for investment)and $386.8 million at December 31, 2014 (1.1% of commercial loans held for investment). The primary factor resulting in the consistency of the allowance for loan and lease losses coverage is the result of continued improvement of credit quality in the portfolio, as evidenced by the decrease in delinquencies, non-accruals, and TDRs. The ACL allocated to the commercial portfolio increased, in part, due to current economic environment impacting our commercial customers in the energy sector. Management recorded additional reserves in relation to this portfolio during 2015.\nConsumer\nThe consumer loan and small business loan portfolios are monitored for credit risk and deterioration with statistical tools considering factors such as delinquency LTV ratios, and internal and external credit scores. Management evaluates the consumer portfolios throughout their life cycles on a portfolio basis. When problem loans are identified that are secured with collateral, management examines the loan files to evaluate the nature and type of collateral. Management documents the collateral type, the date of the most recent valuation, and whether any liens exist to determine the value to compare against the committed loan amount.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResidential mortgages not adequately secured by collateral are generally charged-off when deemed to be uncollectible or are delinquent 180 days or more, whichever comes first, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that repayment will occur regardless of the delinquency status. Examples that would demonstrate repayment likelihood include: a loan that is secured by collateral and is in the process of collection; a loan supported by a valid guarantee or insurance; or a loan supported by a valid claim against a solvent estate.\nFor residential mortgage loans, loss severity assumptions are incorporated into the loan and lease loss reserve models to estimate loan balances that will ultimately charge-off. These assumptions are based on recent loss experience within various CLTV bands in these portfolios. CLTVs are refreshed quarterly by applying Federal Housing Finance Agency Home Price Index changes at a state-by-state level to the last known appraised value of the property to estimate the current CLTV. The Company's allowance for loan and lease losses incorporates the refreshed CLTV information to update the distribution of defaulted loans by CLTV as well as the associated loss given default for each CLTV band. Reappraisals at the individual property level are not considered cost-effective or necessary on a recurring basis; however, reappraisals are performed on certain higher risk accounts to support line management activities and default servicing decisions, or when other situations arise for which the Company believes the additional expense is warranted. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $561.8 million and $5.4 billion of consumer home equity loans and lines of credit, which included $240.6 million and $2.9 billion, or 42.8% and 53.0%, in junior lien positions, respectively. Loss severity rates on these consumer home equity loans and lines of credit in junior lien positions were 57.0% and 69.4%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.\nA home equity loan or line of credit not adequately secured by collateral is treated similarly to how residential mortgages are treated. A home equity loan or line of credit also incorporate loss severity assumptions into the loan and lease loss reserve model following the same methodology as residential mortgage loans. To ensure the Company has captured losses inherent in its home equity portfolios, the Company estimates its allowance for loan and lease losses for home equity loans and lines of credit by segmenting its portfolio into sub-segments based on the nature of the portfolio and certain risk characteristics such as product type, lien positions, and origination channels. Projected future defaulted loan balances are estimated within each portfolio sub-segment by incorporating risk parameters, including the current payment status as well as historical trends in delinquency rates. Other assumptions, including prepayment and attrition rates, are also calculated at the portfolio sub-segment level and incorporated into the estimation of the likely volume of defaulted loan balances. The projected default volume is stratified across CLTV ratio bands, and a loss severity rate for each CLTV band is applied based on the Company's historical net credit loss experience. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market, or industry conditions, or changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral.\nThe Company considers the delinquency status of its senior liens in cases in which the Company services the lien. The Company currently services the senior lien on 24.7% of junior lien home equity principal balances. Of the junior lien home equity loan and line of credit balances that are current, 0.8% have a senior lien that is one or more payments past due. When the senior lien is delinquent but the junior lien is current, allowance levels are adjusted to reflect loss estimates consistent with the delinquency status of the senior lien. The Company also extrapolates these impacts to the junior lien portfolio when the senior lien is serviced by another investor and the delinquency status of that senior lien is unknown.\nDepository and lending institutions in the U.S. generally are expected to experience a significant volume of home equity lines of credit that will be approaching the end of their draw periods over the next several years, following the growth in home equity lending experienced during 2003 through 2007. As a result, many of these home equity lines of credit will either convert to amortizing loans or have principal due as balloon payments. The percentage of the Company's current home equity lines of credit that are expected to reach the end of their draw periods prior to January 1, 2019 is approximately 2.7% and not considered significant. The Company's home equity lines of credit originated prior to 2007 are generally open-ended, revolving loans with fixed-rate lock options and draw periods of up to 15 years, along with amortizing repayment periods of up to 15 years. The Company's home equity lines of credit generated after 2007 are generally open-ended, revolving loans with fixed-rate lock options and draw periods of up to 10 years, along with amortizing repayment periods of up to 20 years. The Company currently monitors delinquency rates for amortizing and non-amortizing lines, as well as other credit quality metrics including FICO credit scoring model score and LTV ratio. The Company's home equity lines of credit are generally underwritten considering fully drawn and fully amortizing levels. As a result, the Company currently does not anticipate a significant deterioration in credit quality when these home equity lines of credit begin to amortize.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor RIC and personal unsecured loans at SC, the Company estimates the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. RICs and personal unsecured loans are considered separately in assessing the required allowance for loan and lease losses using product-specific allowance methodologies applied on pooled basis. For RICs, the Company segregates the portfolio based on homogeneity into pools based on source, then further stratifies each pool by vintage and custom loss forecasting score. For each vintage and risk segment, the Company's vintage model predicts timing of unit losses and the loan balances at time of default. Auto loans are charged off when an account becomes 120 days delinquent if the Company has not repossessed the vehicle. The Company writes the vehicle down to the estimated recovery amount of the collateral when the automobile is repossessed and legally available for disposition.\nThe Company considers changes in the used vehicle index when forecasting recovery rates to apply to the gross losses forecasted by the vintage model. Its models do not include other macro-economic factors. Instead, the allowance for loan and lease loss process considers factors such as unemployment rates and bankruptcy trends as potential qualitative overlays. Management reviews idiosyncratic and systemic risks facing the business. This qualitative overlay framework enables the allowance for loan and lease loss process to arrive at a provision that reflects all relevant information, including both quantitative model outputs and qualitative overlays.\nFor the personal unsecured loan portfolio at SC, as of December 31, 2015, there was no allowance associated with the portfolio as the portfolio was transferred to held for sale in the third quarter of 2015. In previous periods, including December 31, 2014, the Company employed product specific models in determining the required allowance for loan and lease losses. For the fixed rate installment loan portfolio, a vintage modeling approach was employed in which the models predicted the timing of losses and the loan balance at the time of default. As these were unsecured loans, the total loss was the loan balance at the time of default. For revolving loans, the model stratified the portfolio based on delinquency categories and age of account. Loss rates were derived from historical experience to determine the expected portfolio losses over the next 12 months.\nThe allowance for consumer loans was $2.7 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The allowance as a percentage of held for investment consumer loans was 7.0% at December 31, 2015 and 3.4% at December 31, 2014. The increase in the allowance for consumer loans is primarily attributable to SC's personal unsecured loan portfolios being reclassified as held-for-sale, as well as the lower of cost or fair value adjustments on certain RICs and auto loans, which were reflected as charge-offs of $451.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, SC determined that it no longer intended to hold its personal unsecured lending assets for investment. As a result, approximately $1.9 billion of personal unsecured loans were transferred to held-for-sale, net of a lower of cost or fair value adjustment of $377.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the lower of cost or fair value adjustments associated with RIC and auto loan sales was $73.4 million.\nWhen adjusting for these lower of cost or fair value adjustments, SC's consumer loan net charge-off rate did not change materially year-over-year. Future loan originations and purchases under SC's personal lending platform will also be classified as held-for-sale. Future lower of cost or fair value adjustments could impact the reported charge-off ratio; otherwise, the Company does not expect significant movements in its charge-off ratios.\nThe Company's allowance models and reserve levels are back-tested on a quarterly basis to ensure that both remain within appropriate ranges. As a result, management believes that the current allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb inherent losses in the consumer portfolios.\nUnallocated\nAdditionally, the Company reserves for certain inherent, but undetected, losses that are probable within the loan and lease portfolios. This is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models or to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the Company's entire loan and lease portfolios. These imprecisions may include loss factors inherent in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance, as well as potential variability in estimates. Period-to-period changes in the Company's historical unallocated allowance for loan and lease loss positions are considered in light of these factors. The unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses was $45.3 million at December 31, 2015 and $33.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Company estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments consists of two elements: (i) an allocated reserve, which is determined by an analysis of historical loss experience and risk factors, current economic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments, and any other pertinent information, and (ii) an unallocated reserve to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Additions to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are made by charges to the provision for credit losses, and this reserve is classified within Other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Once an unfunded lending commitment becomes funded and is carried as a loan, the corresponding reserves are transferred to the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nThe reserve for unfunded lending commitments increased from $132.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $147.4 million at December 31, 2015. This increase was due to an increase in off-balance sheet lending commitments, which is a result of the overall increase in the Company's commercial lending business. As a result of these shifts, the net impact of the decrease in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to the overall ACL is immaterial.\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES\nInvestment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasuries, MBS, tax-free municipal securities, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities (\"ABS\") and stock in the FHLB and the FRB. MBS consist of pass-through, collateralized mortgage obligations, and adjustable rate mortgages issued by federal agencies. The Company's MBS are either guaranteed as to principal and interest by the issuer or have ratings of AAA\u201d by S&P and Moody's at the date of issuance. The Company's available-for-sale investment strategy is to purchase liquid fixed-rate and floating-rate investments to manage the Company's liquidity position and interest rate risk adequately.\nTotal investment securities available-for-sale increased $5.0 billion to $20.9 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $15.9 billion at December 31, 2014. During 2015, the composition of the Company's investment portfolio changed by decreases in ABS, corporate, and municipal securities which were offset by increases in High Quality Liquid Assets (\"HQLA\") such as U.S. Treasuries and MBS. HQLA are low risk assets that can easily and immediately be converted into cash at little or no loss of value such as cash or investment securities guaranteed by a sovereign entity. This increase was primarily driven by activity within the MBS portfolio, offset by activity within the state and municipal portfolio. MBS increased by $6.2 billion primarily due to $8.3 billion of investment purchases, offset by sales and maturities of $0.7 billion and normal principal amortization during 2015. The state and municipal portfolio decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to sales and maturities of $1.0 billion. During 2015, the Company began implementing a strategy to improve the Company's liquidity by selling non-high-quality liquid assets and reinvesting the funds into HQLA. For additional information with respect to the Company's investment securities, see Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal gross unrealized losses increased $33.2 million during 2015, primarily due to increases in interest rates. The majority of the increases in unrealized losses during the year were in the MBS portfolios and U.S. Treasury securities. The unrealized losses within the MBS portfolios increased by $28.1 million, and the unrealized losses within the U.S. Treasury securities increased by $5.6 million. Refer to Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nThere were no trading securities held at December 31, 2015, compared to $833.9 million at December 31, 2014.\nOther investments, which consists of FHLB stock and FRB stock, increased from $817.0 million at December 31, 2014 to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2015 primarily due to purchases of FHLB and FRB stock, partially offset by the FHLB's repurchase of its stock and adoption of ASU 2014-01 which resulted in the re-classification of $26.4 million in LIHTC investments into Other investments.\nThe average life of the available-for-sale investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at December 31, 2015 was approximately 3.94 years, compared to 4.11 years at December 31, 2014. The average effective duration of the investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at December 31, 2015 was approximately 2.95 years. The actual maturities of MBS available-for-sale will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

Consistent with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize goodwill and reviews the goodwill recorded for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2015, goodwill totaled $4.4 billion and represented 3.5% of total assets and 22.7% of total stockholder's equity.

As a result, the Company conducted a Step 1 interim impairment test on the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit as of April 1, 2015. The Company conducted the interim impairment test in the same manner as its annual impairment test with key inputs and assumptions being updated as of the interim testing date. The results of the interim impairment test validated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit by over 25%. Based on these results, the Company did not consider the goodwill assigned to the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of October 1, 2015, the Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test using the generally accepted valuation methods discussed in the Company's Critical Accounting Policies section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. After conducting a fair valuation analysis of each reporting unit as of the annual testing date, the Company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill identified as a result of the annual impairment analysis.\nFor the Retail Banking reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market approach (\"market approach\") and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. The projected tangible book value (TBV) of 1.5x was selected based on publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 9.5% which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 4.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Retail Banking reporting unit by 21.3%, indicating the Retail Banking reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.5x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 12.9% which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis.

The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit by 34.2%, indicating the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the Commercial Real Estate reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.5x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 10.7% which is most representative of the business' cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates 3.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Commercial Real Estate reporting unit by 33.1% indicating the Commercial Real Estate reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the Corporate and Commercial Banking reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach.

For the market capitalization approach, SC's stock price from October 1, 2015 of $21.80 was used and a 35.0% control premium was used based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. For the market approach, the projected TBV of 1.8x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit and was equally considered with the projected earnings multiple of 8.3x which was applied to reporting unit's 2015 earnings. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 9.9% which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 3.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the SC reporting unit by 11.7%, indicating the SC reporting unit was not considered to be impaired. By the time the annual impairment analysis was finalized, the share price of SC had declined from the $21.80 used in the annual impairment analysis. The Company continued to evaluate the decline of the stock price from the time the annual impairment test was complete through the end of the fourth quarter.\nAt December 31, 2015, given the decline in SC's stock price between the 2015 annual goodwill impairment analysis and year-end, the Company concluded that the fair value of the SC reporting unit was more likely than not less than its carrying value including goodwill. As a result, the Company conducted an interim impairment analysis for possible goodwill impairment of the SC reporting unit's goodwill as of December 31, 2015. For the Step 1 analysis, the Company utilized the market capitalization approach to determine the fair valuation of the reporting unit. The Company used SC's stock price of $15.85, which was the stock's price as of interim testing date. The Company utilized a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable.\nBased on the Company's interim Step 1 analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the SC reporting unit's goodwill exceeded the fair value. As a result, the Company moved onto a Step 2 analysis. For Step 2, the Company compared the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that is recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in Step 1 over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired. Considerable judgment is involved in the determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and as such, directly impact the fair value of the reporting unit calculation which is part of the Step 2 analysis. The most significant estimates related to the fair valuation of the loans and intangible assets.\nBased on the Company's interim Step 1 and Step 2 analyses, the Company concluded that goodwill related to the SC reporting unit was impaired at December 31, 2015. The Company recorded an impairment of goodwill of $4.4 billion. At December 31, 2015 the Company has $1.0 billion of goodwill allocated to the SC reporting unit. Also, as a result of the Company's interim Step 1 and Step 2 analyses, the Company concluded an indefinite-lived intangible asset trade name was impaired. As a result, the Company booked an impairment of $11.7 million. At the time the interim impairment test was complete, the share price of SC had declined from $15.85 used in the interim impairment analysis. The Company is currently evaluating the goodwill of the SC reporting unit for potential impairment for the first quarter of 2016.\nPREMISES AND EQUIPMENT\nTotal premises and equipment, net, was $942.4 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $854.7 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in total premises and equipment was primarily due to computer software implementations, purchases of furniture, office equipment and ATMs as well as leasehold improvements in both corporate and retail. In 2014, certain changes to the Company's IT strategy resulted in the Company conducting an assessment of its capitalized costs related to internally developed software classified as held and used. As part of that assessment, the Company identified a number of assets it determined to have no future service potential as well as assets whose carrying values were not considered recoverable in accordance with applicable accounting standards. This assessment resulted in the Company recording an impairment charge of $97.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 7 for details on premises and equipment.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The $842.8 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $982.9 million decrease in the deferred tax liability related to the Company's investment in SC as a result of the goodwill impairment, partially offset by a $580.2 million increase in the deferred tax liability related to accelerated tax deprecation on leasing transactions. Other activity driving the reduction in the deferred tax liability included a $293.6 million increase in deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, a $167.5 million decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to purchase accounting adjustments for SC, and a net $21.0 million increase in the net deferred tax asset from other temporary differences.\nThe Company has a lawsuit pending against the United States in Federal District Court in Massachusetts relating to the proper tax consequences of two financing transactions with an international bank through which the Company borrowed $1.2 billion. As a result of these financing transactions, the Company paid foreign taxes of $264.0 million during the years 2003 through 2007 and claimed a corresponding foreign tax credit for foreign taxes paid during those years, which the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") disallowed. The IRS also disallowed the Company's deductions for interest expense and transaction costs, totaling $74.6 million in tax liability, and assessed penalties and interest totaling approximately $92.5 million. The Company has paid the taxes, penalties and interest associated with the IRS adjustments for all tax years, and the lawsuit will determine whether the Company is entitled to a refund of the amounts paid. The Company has recorded a receivable in the Other assets line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the amount of these payments, less a tax reserve of $230.1 million, as of December 31, 2015.\nOn November 13, 2015, the Federal District Court issued a written opinion in favor of the Company on all contested issues, and in a judgment issued on January 13, 2016, ordered amounts assessed by the IRS for years 2003 through 2005 to be refunded to the Company. On March 11, 2016, the IRS filed a notice of appeal. The appeal will be heard in the First Circuit.\nIn 2013, two different federal courts decided cases involving similar financing structures entered into by the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (\"BNY Mellon\") and BB&T Corp. (\"BB&T\") in favor of the IRS. BNY Mellon and BB&T each appealed. On May 14, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided BB&T's appeal by affirming the trial court's decision to disallow BB&T's foreign tax credits and to allow penalties, but reversing the trial court and allowed BB&T's entitlement to interest deductions. On September 9, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the trial court's decision in BNY Mellon's case, allowing BNY Mellon to claim interest deductions, but disallowing BNY Mellon's claimed foreign tax credits. On September 29, 2015, BB&T filed a petition requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its appeal of the Federal Circuit Court's decision. BNY Mellon filed a petition requesting the U.S. Supreme Court hear its appeal of the Second Circuit's decision on November 3, 2015. On March 7, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied BB&T's and BNY Mellon's petitions.\nWhile the Company remains confident in the legal merits of its position, the Company increased its reserve position as of December 31, 2015 by $104.2 million, and believes its reserve amount adequately provides for potential exposure to the IRS related to these items. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions could range from a decrease of $230.1 million to an increase of $201.9 million.\nOTHER ASSETS\nOther assets at December 31, 2015 were $1.8 billion, compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease in other assets was primarily due to activity in income tax receivables and miscellaneous assets and receivables, offset by an increase in other repossessed assets.\nIncome tax receivables decreased $328.5 million, primarily due to the decrease in accrued federal tax receivables.\nMiscellaneous assets and receivables decreased $730.8 million primarily due to investment trades unsettled at the end of 2014 that cleared subsequent to December 31, 2014. These unsettled trades were primarily related to $580.7 million in sales of trading securities liquidated in the first quarter of 2015.\nThe decreases above were offset by an increase in other repossessed assets of $67.3 million between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of the auto portfolio, maturities associated with the lease portfolio and the reclassification during 2015 of $31.7M of vehicle inventory previously included within miscellaneous other assets to other repossessed assets.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The increase in deposits was primarily due to increases in money market accounts, CDs and noninterest-bearing accounts, offset by a decrease in interest-bearing accounts. The increase in deposits was primarily comprised of increases in money market accounts of $2.8 billion, or 13.1% and CDs of $1.2 billion, or 16.4% due mainly to continuing better economic conditions encouraging movement from certain interest-bearing investments to money market accounts and CDs.\nInterest-bearing deposit accounts decreased $610.4 million, or 5.6%, primarily due to the shift in deposits to money market accounts. The Company continues to focus its efforts on attracting and increasing lower-cost deposits, however, the cost of deposits increased from 0.49% for the fourth quarter of 2014 to 0.60% for the fourth quarter of 2015.\nDemand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were $25.2 million and $51.3 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Time deposits of $250,000 or more totaled $1.5 billion and $993.4 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nBORROWINGS AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company has term loans and lines of credit with Santander and other third-party lenders. The Bank utilizes borrowings and other debt obligations as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset/liability management. Collateralized advances are available from the FHLB if certain standards related to creditworthiness are met. The Bank also utilizes repurchase agreements, which are short-term obligations collateralized by securities. In addition, SC has warehouse lines of credit and securitizes some of its retail installment contracts and operating leases, which are structured secured financings. Total borrowings and other debt obligations at December 31, 2015 were $49.1 billion, compared to $39.7 billion at December 31, 2014. Total borrowings increased $9.4 billion, primarily due to $3.1 billion of new debt issued by the Bank and the Holding Company, an increase of $4.4 billion in FHLB Advances, and net $2.5 billion of SC securitization activity, offset by maturing debt of $0.6 billion.

The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable of $635.0 million. The decrease was related to investment purchases that were in the process of settling at December 31, 2014. Also contributing to the decrease was the release of FNMA recourse reserves during 2015. The release was attributable to the $1.4 billion re-purchase of multifamily mortgages during the third quarter of 2015 from FNMA. This was offset by increases in miscellaneous payables of $244.7 million due to the Separation Agreement executed in connection with the departure of Thomas Dundon as Chief Executive Officer of SC (the Separation Agreement\u201d) as discussed in Note 1 to these Consolidated Financial Statements and expense accruals of $122.7 million related to workflow accruals. In addition there was an increase in accrued tax credits of $121.4 million.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The decrease in other liabilities was primarily related to the decrease in liabilities associated with derivative activity of $126.2 million due to fluctuations in the mark-to-market valuations in trading derivative accounts. This was offset by an increase in official checks and money orders in process at year-end of $27.7 million.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nSee further discussion of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 8 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Liquidity and Capital Resources section of the MD&A.\nPREFERRED STOCK\nOn May 15, 2006, the Company issued 8.0 million shares of Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and received net proceeds of $195.4 million. The perpetual preferred stock ranks senior to the Company's common stock. This is because perpetual preferred stockholders are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Company's Board of Directors at a rate of 7.30% per annum, payable quarterly, before the Board of Directors may declare or pay any dividend on the Company's common stock. The perpetual preferred stock is redeemable at par. As of December 31, 2015, no preferred stock had been redeemed.\nBANK REGULATORY CAPITAL\nThe Company's capital priorities are to support client growth, business investment, and maintain appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework. The Company continues to improve its capital levels and ratios through retention of quarterly earnings.\nThe Company is subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, the Bank met the well-capitalized capital ratio requirements. The Company's capital levels exceeded the ratios required for BHCs.\nFor a discussion of Basel III, which became effective for SHUSA and the Bank on January 1, 2015, including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned Regulatory Matters within this MD&A.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act established five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution's capital tier depends on its capital levels in relation to various capital measures, which include leverage and risk-based capital measures and certain other factors. Depository institutions that are not classified as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions, payment of management fees, acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFederal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit the Bank's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. The Bank must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank's total distributions to the Holding Company within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years; (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. In addition, the OCC's prior approval would be required if the Bank's examination or Community Reinvestment Act ratings fall below certain levels or the Bank is notified by the OCC that it is a problem association or in troubled condition. In addition, the Bank must obtain the OCC's prior written approval to make any capital distribution until it has positive retained earnings. Under a written agreement with the FRB of Boston, the Company must not declare or pay, and must not permit any non-bank subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company, including SC, to declare or pay, any dividends, and the Company must not make, or permit any such subsidiary to make, any capital distribution, in each case without the prior written approval of the FRB of Boston.\nAny dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing the Bank's capital ratios. There were no dividends declared or paid in 2015 or 2014. The Bank returned capital of $0.0 million and $128.0 million to SHUSA in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following schedule summarizes the actual capital balances of the Bank and SHUSA at December 31, 2015:\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BANK\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Well-capitalized Requirement(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minimum Requirement(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) As defined by OCC regulations.

Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Bank's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would: increase its borrowing costs; require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits; and limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the Economic and Business Environment section of this MD&A.\nSources of Liquidity\nCompany and Bank\nThe Company and the Bank have several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including the Bank's core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. The Company has the following major sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements: dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets.\nOn September 15, 2014, the Company entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank (the \"FRB\") of Boston and the Federal Reserve. Under the terms of this written agreement, the Company must serve as a source of strength to the Bank; strengthen Board oversight of planned capital distributions by the Company and its subsidiaries; and not declare or pay, and not permit any non-bank subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company to declare or pay, any dividends, and not make, or permit any such subsidiary to make, any capital distribution, in each case without the prior written approval of the FRB of Boston.\nOn July 2, 2015, the Company entered into another written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of this written agreement, the Company is required to make enhancements with respect to, among other matters, Board oversight of the consolidated organization, risk management, capital planning and liquidity risk management.\nSC\nSC requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. SC funds its operations through its lending relationships with 13 third-party banks and Santander, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and large flow agreements. SC seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. SC has more than $4.4 billion of stockholders' equity that supports its access to the securitization markets, credit facilities, and flow agreements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, SC completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $15.4 billion, including:\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>five securitizations on its Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust (\"SDART\") platform for $5.7 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a series of seven subordinate bond transactions on its SDART platform totaling $262.0 million to fund residual interests from existing securitizations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>four securitizations on its relaunched DRIVE, deeper subprime, platform for $3.4 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>seven private amortizing loan and lease facilities totaling $3.4 billion; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>top-ups of five private amortizing facilities totaling $2.6 billion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSC also completed $9.2 billion in asset sales, including $1.3 billion in third-party lease sales and $4.3 billion in recurring monthly sales with its third-party flow partners, in addition to executing several sales of charged off assets totaling $122.0 million in proceeds.\nFor information regarding SC's debt, see Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInstitutional borrowings\nThe Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains contingency plans consistent with the Company's access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These include cash, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow at the FHLB and the FRB's discount window.\nAvailable Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Bank had approximately $22.2 billion in committed liquidity from the FHLB and the FRB. Of this amount, $5.9 billion was unused and therefore provides additional borrowing capacity and liquidity for the Company. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents, loans held for sale (\"LHFS\"), and securities available-for-sale exclusive of securities pledged as collateral) totaled approximately $21.1 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 37.5% and 26.1% of total deposits at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 the Bank had $4.1 billion in cash held at the Federal Reserve. Management believes that the Company has ample liquidity to fund its operations.\nCash and cash equivalents\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,135,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,198,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,361,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,664,920\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,681,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,025,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,319,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,490,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,381,227\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, which is comprised of net income of $(3.1) billion, $4.1 billion of provision for credit losses, $6.8 billion in proceeds from sales of LHFS, and $0.8 billion in proceeds from sales of trading securities, offset by $7.6 billion of originations of LHFS, net of repayments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was comprised of net income of $2.9 billion, $2.5 billion of provisions for credit losses, and $5.1 billion in proceeds from sales of LHFS, offset by $2.3 billion of a gain on the Change in Control and $4.6 billion of originations of LHFS, net of repayments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 which was primarily impacted by a decrease in the provision for credit losses and a decrease in LHFS originations.\nCash used in investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $16.7 billion, primarily due to $12.3 billion of purchases of investment securities available-for-sale, $9.5 billion in normal loan activity, and $5.7 billion in leased vehicle purchases, offset by $8.0 billion of investment sales, maturities and prepayments, $2.7 billion in proceeds from sales of loans held for investment and $2.0 billion in proceeds from sales of leased vehicles.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $14.7 billion, primarily due to $5.2 billion of purchases of investment securities available-for-sale, $9.9 billion in normal loan activity and $6.2 billion in leased vehicle purchases, offset by $2.9 billion of investment sales, maturities and repayments and $3.7 billion in proceeds from sales of loans held for investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by investing activities was $9.0 billion, primarily due to $11.3 billion of investment sales, maturities and repayments and $2.1 billion of loan purchases and activity, offset by purchases of $4.9 billion of investment securities available-for-sale.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

Each facility specifies the required collateral characteristics, collateral concentrations, credit enhancement, and advance rates. Warehouse facilities are generally backed by auto RIC and, in some cases, leases or personal loans. These facilities generally have one- or two-year commitments, staggered maturities and floating interest rates. SC maintains daily funding forecasts for originations, acquisitions, and other large outflows such as tax payments to balance the desire to minimize funding costs with its liquidity needs.\nSC's warehouse facilities generally have net spread, delinquency, and net loss ratio limits. These limits are generally calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the line; however, for two of the warehouse facilities, delinquency and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to the serviced portfolio as a whole. Failure to meet any of these covenants could trigger increased overcollateralization requirements or, in the case of limits calculated with respect to the specific portfolio underlying certain credit lines, result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurred under one of these agreements, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the impacted agreement to be immediately due and payable, enforce its interests against collateral pledged under the agreement, restrict SC's ability to obtain additional borrowings under the agreement, and/or remove SC as servicer. SC has never had a warehouse facility terminated due to failure to comply with any ratio or meet any covenant. A default under one of these lines could be enforced only with respect to the impacted facility.\nCertain of SC's credit facilities have covenants requiring timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC. SC has obtained waivers of all such covenants such that its non-timely filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 did not cause an event of default on any of its facilities. SC's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 was filed with the SEC on March 31, 2016.\nSC has two credit facilities with eight banks providing an aggregate commitment of $4.2 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support Chrysler retail financing. As of December 31, 2015, there was an outstanding balance of $2.9 billion. One of the facilities can be used exclusively for loan financing and the other for lease financing. Both facility require reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios exceeding specified thresholds.\nRepurchase Facility\nSC also obtains financing through an investment management agreement with BlackRock, whereby it pledges retained subordinated bonds on its securitizations as collateral for repurchase agreements with various borrowers at renewable terms ranging from 30 to 90 days. As of December 31, 2015, there was an outstanding balance of $851.0 million under the BlackRock repurchase facility.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSantander Credit Facilities\nSantander historically has provided, and continues to provide, SC's business with significant funding support in the form of committed credit facilities. Through its New York branch (\"Santander NY\"), Santander provides SC with $3.0 billion of long-term committed revolving credit facilities.\nThe facilities offered through Santander NY's branch are structured as three- and five-year floating rate facilities, with current maturity dates of December 31, 2016 and 2018. Santander has the option to allow SC to continue to renew the term of these facilities annually going forward, thereby maintaining the three- and five-year maturities. These facilities currently permit unsecured borrowing, but generally are collateralized by RIC as well as securitization notes payable and residuals owned by SC. Any secured balances outstanding under the facilities at the time of their maturity will amortize to match the maturities and expected cash flows of the corresponding collateral.\nUntil March 4, 2016, when the facilities offered through the Santander New York branch were lowered to $3.0 billion, the commitments from the branch totaled $4.5 billion. There was an average outstanding balance of approximately $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion under these facilities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The maximum outstanding balance during each period was $4.4 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively.\nSantander also serves as the counterparty for many of SC's derivative financial instruments.\nSecured Structured Financings\nSC's secured structured financings primarily consist of public, SEC-registered securitizations. SC also executes private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and privately issues amortizing notes.\nSC obtains long-term funding for its receivables through securitizations in the ABS market. The ABS market provides an attractive source of funding due to its cost efficiency, a large and deep investor base, and terms that appropriately match the cash flows of the debt to the cash flows of the underlying assets. The term structure of a securitization generally locks in fixed-rate funding for the life of the underlying fixed-rate assets, and the matching amortization of the assets and liabilities provides committed funding for the collateralized loans throughout their terms. In certain cases, SC may choose to issue floating rate securities based on market conditions; in such cases, SC generally executes hedging arrangements outside of the securitization trusts (the \"Trusts\") to lock in its cost of funds. Because of prevailing market rates, SC did not issue ABS in 2008 or 2009, but began issuing ABS again in 2010. SC has been the largest issuer of retail auto ABS in the U.S. since 2011. SC has issued a total of more than $47.0 billion in retail auto ABS since 2010.\nSC executes each securitization transaction by selling receivables to the Trusts that issue ABS to investors. To attain specified credit ratings for each class of bonds, these transactions have credit enhancement requirements in the form of subordination, restricted cash accounts, excess cash flow, and overcollateralization, whereby more receivables are transferred to the Trusts than the amount of ABS issued by the Trusts.\nExcess cash flows result from the difference between the finance and interest income received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to the ABS investors, net of credit losses and expenses. Initially, excess cash flows generated by the Trusts are used to pay down outstanding debt of the Trusts, increasing over-collateralization until the targeted level of assets has been reached. Once the targeted level of over-collateralization is reached and maintained, excess cash flows generated by the Trusts are released to SC as distributions. SC also receives monthly servicing fees as servicer for the Trusts. SC's securitizations may require an increase in credit enhancement levels if cumulative net losses, as defined in the documents underlying each ABS transaction, exceed a specified percentage of the pool balance. None of SC's securitizations have cumulative net loss percentages above their respective limits.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSC's on-balance sheet securitization transactions utilize bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities, which are also variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") that meet the requirements to be consolidated in the Company's financial statements. Following a securitization, the finance receivables and notes payable related to the securitized retail installment contracts remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recognizes finance and interest income as well as fee income on the collateralized RIC and interest expense on the ABS issued. The Company also records a provision for credit losses to cover inherent credit losses on the RIC. While these Trusts are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, they are separate legal entities. The finance receivables and other assets sold to the Trusts are owned by them, are available only to satisfy the notes payable related to the securitized RIC, and are not available to SC's or the Company's creditors or those of its other subsidiaries.\nABS credit spreads have been widening, beginning in the second half of 2015 and continuing into 2016. Highly liquid, frequent issuers with public shelf registrations, such as SC, have remained active in the market while smaller, newer market entrants have experienced significant spread widening. SC has completed eleven securitizations in 2015, in addition to executing seven subordinate bond transactions to obtain additional liquidity from residual interests in existing securitizations. SC currently has 35 securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative ABS balance of approximately $14.6 billion. SC's securitizations generally have several classes of notes, with principal paid sequentially based on seniority and any excess spread distributed to the residual holder. SC generally retains the lowest bond class and the residual, except in the case of off-balance sheet securitizations. SC uses the proceeds from securitization transactions to repay borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, originate and acquire loans and leases, and for general corporate purposes. SC generally exercises clean-up call options on its securitizations when the collateral pool balance reaches 10% of its original balance.\nSC periodically privately issues amortizing notes in transactions that are structured similarly to its public and Rule 144A securitizations but are issued to banks and conduits. SC's securitizations and private issuances are collateralized by vehicle RIC, loans and vehicle leases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nSC periodically executes Chrysler Capital-branded securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. Because all of the notes and residual interests in these securitizations are issued to third parties, SC records these transactions as true sales of the retail installment contracts securitized, and removes the sold assets from its Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, SC executed two off-balance sheet securitizations under its Chrysler Capital Auto Receivables Trust, (CCART) a securitization platform, selling $1.6 billion of gross RIC.\nThe widening in ABS credit spreads in late 2015 and into 2016 has been accompanied by decreased demand for the subordinate tranches of securitizations, including the highest-yielding bonds as well as the residual interests. This market dynamic may impact SC's execution and pricing of off-balance sheet securitizations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, SC sold residual interests in certain Trusts and certain retained bonds in those Trusts to an unrelated third party. SC received cash proceeds of $661.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the sale of these residual interests and retained bonds. Each of these Trusts was previously determined to be a VIE. Prior to the sale of these residual interests, the associated Trusts were consolidated by SC because SC held a variable interest in each VIE and had determined that it was the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. SC will continue to service the loans of these Trusts and may reacquire certain retail installment loans from the Trusts through the exercise of an optional clean-up call, as permitted through the respective servicing agreements. Although SC will continue to service the loans in the associated Trusts and, therefore, will have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Trust, SC concluded that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of the Trusts upon the sale of SC's residual interests. As a result, SC deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of the corresponding Trusts upon their sale. Upon settlement of these transactions, SC derecognized $1.9 billion in assets and $1.2 billion in notes payable and other liabilities of the Trust. For the year ended December 31, 2015 the sale of these interests resulted in a net decrease to provision for credit losses of $113.7 million, after giving effect to lower of cost or market adjustments of $73.0 million.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, SC executed its first two bulk sales of leases to a third party. Due to accelerated depreciation permitted for tax purposes, these two sales generated large taxable gains that SC has deferred through a qualified like-kind exchange program. To qualify for this deferral, SC is required to maintain the sale proceeds in escrow until reinvested in new lease originations. Because the sale proceeds were also needed to pay down the third-party credit facilities under which it had financed the leases prior to their sale, SC has increased its borrowings on its related party credit facilities until the sale proceeds are fully reinvested over the 180 days following each sale. Taxable gains related to proceeds not reinvested were recognized following the 180 day deferral period.\nUses of Liquidity\nThe Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests.\nDividends and Stock Issuances\nIn February 2014, the Company issued 7.0 million shares of common stock to Santander in exchange for cash in the amount of $1.75 billion. Also in February 2014, the Company raised $750.0 million of capital by issuing 3.0 million shares of common stock to Santander in exchange for canceling debt of an equivalent amount.\nIn May 2014, the Company issued 84,000 shares of its common stock to Santander in exchange for cash in the amount of $21.0 million.\nOn May 1, 2014, SC's Board of Directors declared the May SC Dividend, a cash dividend of $0.15 per share, which was paid on May 30, 2014 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 12, 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company's liquidity to meet debt payments, debt service and debt maturities was in excess of 12 months.\nThere were no dividends declared or paid during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 530,391,043 shares of common stock outstanding.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset/liability management, to fund acquisitions, and to meet required capital needs.

In January the Bank early terminated $0.4 billion of Advances maturing in April 2016 for which the Bank recognized a termination fee of $4.4 million. In March the Bank early terminated $0.9 billion of Advances with maturities ranging from September 2016 to February 2018 for with the Bank recognized a termination fee of $28.4 million.\nSubsequent to year-end SHUSA issued $1.5 billion of Senior Unsecured Floating Rate Notes with a maturity of April 2017 to Santander in February 2016.\nExcluded from the above table are deposits of $47.6 billion that are due on demand by customers. Additionally, $247.3 million of tax liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with those obligations.\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. See further discussion on these risks in Note 15 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFlow Agreements\nIn addition to its credit facilities and secured structured financings, SC has flow agreements in place with Bank of America and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania (\"CBP\") for Chrysler Capital RIC, and with another third party for charged off assets.\nSC enters into flow agreements under which assets are sold on a periodic basis to provide funding for new originations. These assets are not on SC's balance sheet, but may provide a gain or loss on sale and a stable stream of servicing fee income.\nSC has a flow agreement with Bank of America under which SC is committed to sell up to a specified amount of eligible loans to that bank each month through May 2018. Prior to October 1, 2015, the amount of this monthly commitment was $300.0 million. On October 1, 2015, SC and Bank of America amended the flow agreement to increase the maximum commitment to sell up to $350.0 million of eligible loans each month, and to change the required written notice period from either party, in the event of termination of the agreement, from 120 days to 90 days. SC retains servicing on all sold loans and may receive or pay a servicer performance payment based on an agreed-upon formula if performance on the sold loans is better or worse, respectively, than expected performance at the time of sale.\nSC has sold loans to CBP under terms of a flow agreement and predecessor sale agreements. SC retains servicing on the sold loans and will owe CBP a loss-sharing payment capped at 0.5% of the original pool balance if losses exceed a specified threshold, established on a pool-by-pool basis. On June 25, 2015, SC executed an amendment to the servicing agreement with CBP, which increased the servicing fee that SC receives. SC and CBP also amended the flow agreement which reduced, effective on August 1, 2015, CBP's committed purchases of Chrysler Capital prime loans from a maximum of $600.0 million and a minimum of $250.0 million per quarter to a maximum of $200.0 million and a minimum of $50.0 million per quarter, as may be adjusted according to the agreement. In January 2016, SC executed an amendment to the servicing agreement with CBP which decreased the servicing fee the Company received on loans sold to CBP by SC under the flow agreement.\nLending Arrangements\nSC is obligated to make purchase price holdback payments to a third-party originator of loans that we purchase on a periodic basis, when losses are lower than originally expected. SC is also obligated to make total return settlement payments to this third-party originator in 2016 and 2017 if returns on the purchased pools are greater than originally expected.\nSC has extended revolving lines of credit to certain auto dealers. Under this arrangement, SC is committed to lend up to each dealer's established credit limit.\nUnder terms of agreements with LendingClub, the Company was committed to purchase, at a minimum, through December 31, 2015, the lesser of $30,000 per month or 50% of LendingClub's aggregate \"near-prime\" (as that term is defined in the agreements) originations and, thereafter through July 2017, the lesser of $30,000 per month or 50% of the lending platform company's aggregate near-prime originations. This commitment could be reduced or canceled with 90 days' notice. On October 9, 2015, the Company sent a notice of termination to LendingClub.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn April 2013, SC entered into certain agreements with Bluestem. The terms of the agreements include a commitment by SC to purchase new advances originated by Bluestem, along with existing balances on accounts with new advances, for an initial term ending in April 2020 and, based on an amendment in June 2014, renewable through April 2022 at Bluestem's option. Each customer account generated under the agreements generally is approved with a credit limit higher than the amount of the initial purchase, with each subsequent purchase automatically approved as long as it does not cause the account to exceed its limit and the customer is in good standing. As these credit lines do not have a specified maturity, but rather can be terminated at any time in the event of adverse credit changes or lack of use, SC has not recorded an allowance for unfunded commitments. SC is required to make a monthly profit-sharing payment to Bluestem.\nIn 2015, SC made a strategic decision to exit the personal lending market to focus on our core objectives of expanding the reach and realizing the full value of our vehicle finance platform. We believe that this will create other opportunities such as expanding our serviced for others platform and diversifying our funding sources and growing our capital. SC commenced certain marketing activities to find buyers for the personal lending assets. On February 1, 2016, SC completed the sale of assets from its personal lending portfolio to an unrelated third party. The portfolio was comprised solely of LendingClub installment loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, on March 24, 2016, in preparation for the sale or liquidation of our portfolio of loans originated under terms of an agreement whereby we review point-of-sale credit applications for retail store customers, we notified most of the retailers for which we review applications that we will no longer fund new originations effective April 11, 2016. As we refocus on our core objectives, we continue to perform under various other agreements under which we purchase specified volumes of personal loans originated by third parties.\nIn April 2014, SC entered into an application transfer agreement with Nissan, whereby SC has the first opportunity to review for its own portfolio any credit applications turned down by Nissan's captive finance company. The agreement does not require SC to originate any loans, but for each loan originated SC will pay Nissan a referral fee, comprised of a volume bonus fee and a loss betterment bonus fee. The loss betterment bonus fee will be calculated annually and is based on the amount by which losses on loans originated under the agreement are lower than an established percentage threshold.\nOther\nOn July 2, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with former SC Chief Executive Officer Thomas G. Dundon, DDFS, and Santander related to Mr. Dundon's departure from SC (the Separation Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement the Company was deemed to have delivered an irrevocable notice to exercise its option to acquire all of the shares of SC Common Stock owned by DDFS and consummate the transactions contemplated by the call option notice, subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals (the \"Call Transaction\"). At that date, the SC Common Stock held by DDFS (\"the DDFS Shares\") represented approximately 9.7% of SC Common Stock. The Separation Agreement did not affect Santander's option to assume the Company's obligation under the Call Transaction as provided in the Shareholders Agreement that was entered into by the same parties on January 28, 2014. Under the Separation Agreement, because the Call Transaction was not consummated prior to October 15, 2015 (the Call End Date\u201d), DDFS is free to transfer any or all of the DDFS shares, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2014, between DDFS and Santander. In the event the Call Transaction were to be completed after the Call End Date, interest would accrue on the price paid per share in the Call Transaction at the overnight LIBOR rate on the third business day preceding the consummation of the Call Transaction plus 100 basis points with respect to the shares of SC Common Stock that were ultimately sold in the Call Transaction. For additional detail regarding this transaction and the Separation Agreement, refer to the Form 8-K the Company filed with the SEC on July 2, 2015 and Note 17 to these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk arises primarily through the Company's traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company and guides new business. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives.\nInterest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions and competitor pricing.\nNet Interest Income Simulation Analysis\nThe Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These scenarios include both parallel and non-parallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company's risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates.\nThe table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company's net interest income based on interest rate changes:\nTable 268: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>If interest rates changed in parallel by the\namounts below at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to\nnet interest income would result\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.29\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarket Value of Equity (\"MVE\") Analysis\nThe Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk, and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company's MVE at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The following estimated percentage\nincrease/(decrease) to MVE would result\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>If interest rates changed in parallel by\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.44\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.28\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.40\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.74\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company's MVE profile showed a decrease of 3.44% for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and also an increase of 0.23% for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 200 basis points. This is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely non-maturity deposits) ( NMDs\u201d).\nIn downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products' prepayments increase, their duration decreases and their market value appreciation therefore is limited. At the same time, with deposit rates already close to zero, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company's mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks the loss in market value is not offset by the change in the NMD.\nLimitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses\nSince the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business and behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors.\nUses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks\nTo mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows.\nThrough the Company's capital markets and mortgage banking activities, it is subject to price risk. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, the SHUSA Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period.\nManagement uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environment.\nThe Company enters into cross-currency swaps to hedge its foreign currency exchange risk on certain Euro-denominated investments. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges at inception.\nThe Company's derivative portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. As part of its overall business strategy, the Bank originates fixed-rate residential mortgages. It sells a portion of this production to the FHLMC, the FNMA, and private investors. The Company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Item 7.\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. Residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.\nThe Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options, which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products.\nFor additional information on foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA\nWe have made certain corrections to previously disclosed amounts to correct for errors related to the allowance for credit losses, TDRs, and the classification of subvention payments related to leased vehicles.

The net loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily related the impairment on goodwill that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015. For further discussion on this matter, see the section of the MD&A captioned Goodwill.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company had a net loss on investment securities of $0.3 million, compared to a net loss of $2.0 million during the third quarter of 2015 and a net gain of $15.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. The net gain on investment securities for the fourth quarter of 2014 is primarily due to gains on MBS and EMI investments sold that did not recur in the fourth quarter or third quarter of 2015.\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $978.6 million during the third quarter of 2015 and $803.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in the provision for credit losses from the third quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily due the impacts of purchase accounting on the retail installment contract portfolio which resulted in lower provisions during 2014 and higher provisions during 2015. Further information about the accounting for these portfolios is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the purchase accounting impacts, during the third quarter of 2015, the strategic decision was made to begin exiting the personal unsecured lending business and as a result, the personal unsecured loan portfolio was reclassified from LHFI to LHFS. The markdown to fair value of this portfolio was recorded in provision for credit losses during the third quarter of 2015. Subsequent markdowns to fair value on the personal unsecured LHFS portfolio were recorded as a deduction to Miscellaneous income during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nTotal fees and other income during the fourth quarter of 2015 were $509.3 million, compared to $713.0 million for the third quarter of 2015 and $648.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease from the third quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to subsequent markdowns to the fair value of the personal unsecured LHFS portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2015 and $949.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase between the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, was primarily due to increases in lease expenses from the continued growth in the Company's lease portfolio over the year. In addition, there was an increase in compensation and benefits in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, due to a one-time $30.0 million severance charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOther expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $4.5 billion, compared to $29.7 million for the third quarter of 2015 and $142.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increases were primarily related to a $4.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to no significant charges in the third quarter of 2015 or fourth quarter of 2014. For further discussion on this matter, see the section of the MD&A captioned Goodwill. Other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014 did include amortization on intangibles that were fully-amortized in 2015 and a loss on debt extinguishment in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nIncome tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.0 billion, compared to an income tax provision of $190.6 million in the third quarter of 2015 and an income tax provision of $129.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decreases between the fourth quarter of 2015 from the third quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014 were primarily due to decreases in net taxable income, the components of which are discussed above, but most significantly included a $4.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements.",
    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\"MD&A\")\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSantander Holdings USA, Inc. (\"SHUSA\" or the \"Company\") is the parent company of Santander Bank, National Association, (the \"Bank\" or \"SBNA\"), a national banking association, and owns approximately 59% of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, \"SC\"), a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banco Santander, S.A. (\"Santander\").\nThe Bank, previously named Sovereign Bank, National Association, changed its name to Santander Bank, National Association on October 17, 2013. The Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\"). The principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The volumes, and accordingly the financial results, of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint.\nSC's primary business is the indirect origination of retail installment contracts (\"RICs\"), principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. SC also offers a full spectrum of auto financing products and services to Chrysler customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand, the trade name used in providing services (\"Chrysler Capital\") under the ten-year private label financing agreement with the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (\"FCA\"), formerly Chrysler Group LLC signed by SC in 2013 (the \"Chrysler Agreement\"). These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. Under the terms of the Chrysler Agreement, certain standards were agreed to, including SC meeting specified escalating penetration rates for the first five years, and FCA treating SC in a manner consistent with comparable original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") treatment of their captive providers, primarily in regard to sales support. The failure of either party to meet their respective obligations under the agreement could result in the agreement being terminated. While SC has not achieved the targeted penetration rates to date, Chrysler Capital continues to be a focal point of its strategy, and SC continues to work with FCA to improve penetration rates and remains confident about the ongoing success of the Chrysler Agreement.\nSC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has several relationships through which it provides personal unsecured loans, private-label credit cards and other consumer finance products.\nOn January 22, 2014, SC's registration statement for an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of shares of its common stock (the SC Common Stock\u201d), was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Prior to the IPO, the Company owned approximately 65% of SC Common Stock.\nOn January 28, 2014, the IPO closed, and certain stockholders of SC, including the Company and Sponsor Auto Finance Holdings Series LP (\"Sponsor Holdings\"), sold 85,242,042 shares of SC Common Stock. Immediately following the IPO, the Company owned approximately 61% of the shares of SC Common Stock. In connection with these sales, certain board representation, governance and other rights granted to Dundon DFS, LLC (\"DDFS\") and Sponsor Holdings were terminated as a result of the reduction in DDFS and Sponsor Holdings' collective ownership of shares of SC Common Stock below certain ownership thresholds, causing the first quarter 2014 change in control and consolidation of SC (the \"Change in Control\").\nPrior to the Change in Control, the Company accounted for its investment in SC under the equity method. Following the Change in Control, the Company consolidated the financial results of SC in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's consolidation of SC is treated as an acquisition of SC by the Company in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805 - Business Combinations (ASC 805). SC Common Stock is now listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") under the trading symbol \"SC\".\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOverview\nDuring 2015, unemployment improved while market results declined and the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate came in under expectations in most quarters, marking overall mixed results for the U.S. economy.\nThe unemployment rate at December 31, 2015 improved to 5.0% from 5.1% at September 30, 2015 and 5.6% one year ago. According to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, this job growth is primarily attributable to the professional and business services, retail trade, and health care sectors.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis advance estimate indicates that real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 0.7% during the fourth quarter of 2015. This is down from a rate of 2.0% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease during the quarter is primarily attributed to a decrease in personal consumption expenditures, residential fixed investment, and federal government spending, but was offset by increased household spending, state and local government spending, and residential fixed investment.\nMarkets improved in the fourth quarter of 2015, but were, in general, down for the year in total resulting from a decline that began in the second quarter, sparked by the Greek debt crisis and by short-term market trading disruptions in China and the U.S. The total year-to-date returns for the following indices, based on closing prices, at December 31, 2015 were:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dow Jones Industrial Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P 500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASDAQ Composite\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt its December 2015 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC\u201d) announced an increase the federal funds rate target to 0.25%-0.5%. The inflation rate remains just under the targeted rate of 2.0%. This long anticipated increase did result in some impacts on the stock market and a small boost in interest rates.\nThe 10-year Treasury bond rate at December 31, 2015 was 2.27%, up from 2.17% at December 31, 2014. Over the past year, the 10-year Treasury bond rate increased 10 basis points. Within the industry, this metric is often considered to correspond to 15- and 30-year mortgage rates. According to statistics published by the Mortgage Bankers Association, mortgage originations decreased 0.26% from September 30, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and increased from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 by 22.2%. Refinancing activity increased by 28.6% from September 30, 2015, and 35.3% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, respectively.\nRegarding commercial activity, the most recent indicators show that commercial real estate and multifamily originations have decreased compared with the prior quarter and increased compared with the prior year. In addition, the ratio of NPL to total loans has declined for the past four consecutive years for U.S. banks, including a decreasing trend in 2015, which confirms continuing improvement in credit quality and downward trend in general allowance reserves.\nChanging market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The continued low interest rate environment presents challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk, and the associated provision for credit losses and legal expense.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7.

billion.\nThese investments are included within corporate debt securities discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's total exposure to European entities decreased $397.0 million, or 32.2%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $305.1 million of loans that were denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nOverall, gross exposure to the foregoing countries was approximately 0.9% of the Company's total assets as of December 31, 2015, and no more than 1% was to any given country or third party. The Company currently does not have credit protection on any of these exposures, nor does it provide lending services in Europe. The Company transacts with various European banks as counterparties to interest rate swaps and foreign currency transactions for its hedging and customer-related activities; however, these derivatives transactions are generally subject to master netting and collateral support agreements, which significantly limit the Company's exposure to loss.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nManagement conducts periodic stress tests of the Company's significant country risk exposures, analyzing the direct and indirect impacts on the risk of loss from various macroeconomic and capital markets scenarios. The Company does not have significant exposure to foreign country risks because its foreign portfolio is relatively small. However, the Company has identified exposure to increased loss from U.S. borrowers associated with the potential indirect impact of a European downturn on the U.S. economy. The Company mitigates these potential impacts through its normal risk management processes, which includes active monitoring and, if necessary, the application of loss mitigation strategies.\nCredit Rating Actions\nThe following table presents Moody's and Standard & Poor's (\"S&P\") credit ratings for the Bank, SHUSA, Santander and the Kingdom of Spain as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>BANK\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHUSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SANTANDER\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SPAIN\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LT Senior Debt\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ST Deposits\n</td> <td>P-1\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubsequent to the year end, on February 19, 2016, Moody's downgraded the outlook of the Kingdom of Spain's from positive to stable. In addition, on February 22, 2016, Moody's affirmed and changed the outlook on the A3 long term and senior unsecured debt rating of Santander to stable from positive.\nSHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA.\nAt this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nThe activities of the Company and the Bank are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws, including the Bank Holding Company (\"BHC\") Act, the Federal Reserve Act, the National Bank Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the \"FDIA\"), the Dodd-Frank Act (the \"DFA\"), the Truth-in-Lending Act (which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers), the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (which governs the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (which governs the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies), the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (which requires financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans), the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (the \"SCRA\"), Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce), the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of ATMs and other electronic banking services), as well as other federal and state laws.\nAs SC is a subsidiary of the Company, it is also subject to regulatory oversight from FRB for BHC regulatory supervision purposes, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \"CFPB\").\nDFA\nOn July 21, 2010, the DFA was enacted. The DFA instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector during the financial crisis and includes a number of provisions designed to promote enhanced supervision and regulation of financial companies and financial markets. The DFA introduced a substantial number of reforms that reshape the structure of the regulation of the financial services industry. The enhanced regulation has and will continue to involve higher compliance costs and negatively affect the Company's revenue and earnings.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nMore specifically, the DFA imposes enhanced prudential standards on BHCs with at least $50.0 billion in total consolidated assets (often referred to as systemically important financial institutions\u201d or \"SIFIs\"), which includes the Company, and requires the Federal Reserve to establish prudential standards for such BHCs that are more stringent than those applicable to other BHCs, including standards for risk-based requirements and leverage limits; heightened capital and liquidity standards, including eliminating trust preferred securities as Tier 1 regulatory capital; enhanced risk management requirements; and credit exposure reporting and concentration limits. These changes have impacted and are expected to continue impacting the profitability and growth of the Company.\nThe DFA mandates an enhanced supervisory framework, which means that the Company is subject to annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve, and the Company and the Bank are required to conduct semi-annual and annual stress tests, respectively, reporting results to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Federal Reserve also has discretionary authority to establish additional prudential standards, on its own or at the Financial Stability Oversight Council's recommendation, regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits, and otherwise as deemed appropriate.\nUnder the Durbin Amendment to the DFA, in June 2011 the Federal Reserve issued the final rule implementing debit card interchange fee and routing regulation. The final rule establishes standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers including the Bank, are reasonable and proportional\u201d to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions, and prohibits network exclusivity arrangements on debit cards to ensure merchants have choices in how debit card transactions are routed.\nThe DFA established the CFPB, which has broad powers to set the requirements for the terms and conditions of consumer financial products. This has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased compliance costs and reduced revenue.\nIn March 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin recommending that indirect vehicle lenders, including SC, take steps to monitor and impose controls over vehicle dealer \"mark-up\" policies under which dealers impose higher interest rates on certain consumers, with the mark-up shared between the dealer and the lender. In accordance with SC's policy, dealers were allowed to mark-up interest rates by a maximum of 2.00%, but in October 2013 SC reduced the maximum compensation (participation from 2.00% (industry practice) to 1.75%). The Company believes this restriction removes the dealers' incentive to mark-up rates beyond 1.75%. The Company plans to continue to evaluate this policy for effectiveness and may make further changes to strengthen oversight of dealers and mark-up rates.\nOn July 31, 2015, the CFPB notified SC that it had referred to the Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") certain alleged violations by SC of the ECOA regarding (i) statistical disparities in mark-ups charged by automobile dealers to protected groups on loans originated by those dealers and purchased by SC and (ii) the treatment of certain types of income in SC's underwriting process. On September 25, 2015, the DOJ notified SC that it had initiated, based on the referral from the CFPB, an investigation under the ECOA of SC's pricing of automobile loans.\nThe Company routinely executes interest rate swaps for the management of its asset/liability mix, and also executes such swaps with its borrower clients. Under the DFA, the Bank is required to post collateral with certain of its counterparties and clearing exchanges. While clearing these financial instruments offers some benefits and additional transparency in valuation, the system requirements for clearing execution add operational complexities to the business and accordingly increase operational risk exposure.\nProvisions of the DFA relating to the applicability of state consumer protection laws to national banks, including the Bank, became effective in July 2011. Questions may arise as to whether certain state consumer financial laws that were previously preempted by federal law are no longer preempted as a result of these new provisions. Depending on how such questions are resolved, the Bank may experience an increase in state-level regulation of its retail banking business and additional compliance obligations, which may impact revenue and costs. SC is already subject to such state-level regulation.\nThe DFA and certain other legislation and regulations impose various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers. The Company's ability to attract and/or retain talented personnel may be adversely affected by these restrictions.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nOther requirements of the DFA include increases in the amount of deposit insurance assessments the Bank must pay; changes to the nature and levels of fees charged to consumers, which are negatively affecting the Bank's income; banning banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and restricting their sponsorship of, or investing in, hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to limited exceptions; and increasing regulation of the derivatives markets through measures that broaden the derivative instruments subject to regulation and requiring clearing and exchange trading as well as imposing additional capital and margin requirements for derivatives market participants, which will increase the cost of conducting this business.\nVolcker Rule\nThe DFA added new section 13 to the BHC Act which is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.\u201d The Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity\u201d from engaging in proprietary trading\u201d or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a hedge fund or a private equity fund (together, a Covered Fund\u201d): (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the fund; (ii) controlling the fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities\nBecause the term banking entity\u201d includes an insured depository institution, a depository institution holding company and any affiliate of any of the foregoing, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, SC, the Bank and numerous other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad.\nWhen the agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule approved the final regulations implementing the rule, the Federal Reserve extended the deadline for compliance with the rule until July 21, 2015. The Federal Reserve subsequently extended the deadline by which banking entities were to conform investments in and relationships with Covered Funds and foreign funds that may be subject to the Volcker Rule and that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 ( Legacy Covered Funds\u201d) until July 21, 2016. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve expressed its intention to grant a final one-year extension until July 21, 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships with Legacy Covered Funds. The extension did not apply to non-Legacy Covered Funds or to proprietary trading activities which were required to conform to the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015.\nIn implementing the Volcker Rule, an examination was made of all activities and investments worldwide to determine which banking entities were involved in proprietary trading and/or Covered Fund activity. Based on this review, all proprietary trading that was not permitted under the Volcker Rule was terminated and all Covered Fund activity was addressed under the rule's requirements. As a result, the Company and its banking entity subsidiaries satisfied all requirements of the Volcker Rule for non-Legacy Covered Funds by the July 21, 2015 deadline. In addition, many Legacy Covered Funds have already been conformed to the requirements of the Volcker Rule or will either be conformed to the Volcker Rule's requirements or divested before any deadline for conformance.\nCertain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that are necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule were implemented before July 21, 2015. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on the size of the entity and its level of trading activities. The compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments that are permitted under the rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Volcker Rule. On March 31, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, on behalf of Santander, provided an attestation to the federal agencies responsible for administering the rule that the compliance program requirements applicable to Santander's U.S. operations under the Volcker Rule were met by July 21, 2015.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act established five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution's capital tier depends on its capital levels in relation to various capital measures, which include leverage and risk-based capital measures and certain other factors. Depository institutions that are not classified as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions, payment of management fees, acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nBasel III\nNew and evolving capital standards, both as a result of the DFA and the implementation in the U.S. of Basel III, have and will continue to have a significant effect on banks and BHCs, including the Company and the Bank. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC released final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III. The final rules established a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active U.S. banks, formerly known as Basel II, and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over $500 million in assets. Subject to various transition periods, the rule became effective for the largest banks on January 1, 2014, and for all other banks on January 1, 2015.\nThe new rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios that, when fully phased in, will require banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 (\"CET1\") capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter. These requirements for the Company and the Bank went into effect on January 1, 2015.\nA capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios will be phased in over three years starting in 2016, beginning at 0.625% and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. This capital conservation buffer will be required for banking institutions and BHCs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends.\nThe final framework included new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\"), deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 for the Company and the Bank began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased in over three years.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Bank's and the Company's CET1 ratio under Basel III, on a fully phased-in basis under the standardized approach, were 13.36% and 10.97%, respectively. Under the transitions provided under Basel III, the Bank's and the Company's CET1 ratio under the standardized approach, were 13.81% and 11.95%, respectively. The calculation of the CET1 ratio under both a fully phased-in and transition basis is based on management's interpretation of the final rules adopted by the Federal Reserve in July 2013. As part of the implementation of any regulations, management interprets the rules in order to implement the new regulations. If the regulators would interpret the rules differently, there could be an impact to the results of the calculation which may have a negative impact to the calculation of CET1. As mentioned above, the minimum required CET1 ratio is comprised of the 4.5% minimum and the 2.5% conservation buffer. On that basis, the Company believes that, as of December 31, 2015, it would remain above regulatory minimums under the currently enacted capital adequacy requirements of Basel III, including when implemented on a fully phased-in basis.\nSee the Bank Regulatory Capital section of the MD&A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company.\nThe Basel III liquidity framework will require banks and BHCs to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, will be required by regulation going forward. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (\"LCR\"), is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (\"HQLA\") equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. The other, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\"), is designed to promote more medium and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nOn October 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC issued a proposal to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. On September 3, 2014, the agencies approved the final LCR rule. The agencies stressed that LCR is a key component in their effort to strengthen the liquidity soundness of the U.S. financial sector and is used to complement the broader liquidity regulatory framework and supervisory process such as Enhanced Prudential Standards (\"EPS\") and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\"CCAR\"). The agencies have mandated a phased implementation approach under which the most globally important covered companies (more than $700 billion in assets) and large regional financial institutions ($250 billion to $700 billion in assets) were required to report their LCR calculation beginning January 1, 2015. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as SHUSA are required to report their LCR calculation monthly beginning January 1, 2016. On November 13, 2015, the Federal Reserve published a revised final LCR rule. Under this revision, the Company is required to calculate the 'Modified US LCR (the \"US LCR\") on a monthly basis beginning with data as of January 31, 2016 for the BHC. There is no requirement to submit the calculation to the Fed. The Company will be required to publicly disclose its US LCR results starting July 1, 2017. Based on management's interpretation of the final rule, effective on January 1, 2016, the Company's LCR was in excess of the regulatory minimum of 90% which will increase to 100% on January 1, 2017.\nOn October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the final standard for the NSFR. The NSFR requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities, thus reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity position in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. NSFR will become a minimum standard by January 1, 2018.\nThe next step will be publication of a U.S. notice of proposed rule-making on implementation of NSFR.\nStress Tests and Capital Adequacy\nPursuant to the DFA, as part of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR, certain banks and BHCs, including the Company and the Bank, are required to perform stress tests and submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve and the OCC on an annual basis, and receive a notice of non-objection to those capital plans from the Federal Reserve and the OCC before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in the Company's stress tests and capital plans. In March 2014 and 2015, the Federal Reserve, as part of its CCAR process, objected on qualitative grounds to the capital plans submitted by the Company. In its 2015 public report on CCAR, the Federal Reserve cited widespread and critical deficiencies in the Company's capital planning processes, including specific deficiencies in governance, internal controls, risk identification and risk management, management information systems, and supporting assumptions and analysis. As a result of the 2014 and 2015 CCAR objections, the Company is not permitted to make any capital distributions without the Federal Reserve's approval other than the continued payment of dividends on the Company's outstanding class of preferred stock, until a new capital plan is approved by the Federal Reserve. The Company submitted its annual capital plan on April 5, 2016.\nOn May 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of SC declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share of SC Common Stock (the \"May SC dividend\"). The Federal Reserve informed the Company on May 22, 2014 that it did not object to SC's payment of the May SC dividend, provided that Santander contribute at least $20.9 million of capital to the Company prior to such payment, so that the Company's consolidated capital position would be unaffected by the May SC dividend. The Federal Reserve also informed the Company that, until the Federal Reserve issues a non-objection to the Company's capital plan, any future SC dividend will require prior receipt of a written non-objection from the Federal Reserve. On May 28, 2014, the Company issued 84,000 shares of its common stock, no par value per share, to Santander in exchange for cash in the amount of $21.0 million.\nOn September 15, 2014, the Company entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank (the \"FRB\") of Boston and the Federal Reserve. Under the terms of this written agreement, the Company must serve as a source of strength to the Bank; strengthen Board oversight of planned capital distributions by the Company and its subsidiaries; and not declare or pay, and not permit any non-bank subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company to declare or pay, any dividends, and not make, or permit any such subsidiary to make, any capital distribution, in each case without the prior written approval of the FRB of Boston.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nOn March 11, 2015, the Federal Reserve announced that the Company received an objection from the FRB of Boston to the 2015 capital plan the Company submitted on January 5, 2015. The FRB of Boston objected to the Company's capital plan on qualitative grounds due to significant deficiencies in the Company's capital planning process. Subject to the restrictions outlined above with respect to the written agreement, the FRB did not object to the Company's payment of dividends on its outstanding class of preferred stock. The FRB of Boston did object to the requested payment of dividends on SC Common Stock.\nOn July 2, 2015, the Company entered into a written agreement with the FRB of Boston. Under the terms of that written agreement, the Company is required to make enhancements with respect to, among other matters, board oversight of the consolidated organization, risk management, capital planning and liquidity risk management.\nTotal Loss Absorbing Capacity\nOn October 30, 2015 the Federal Reserve released a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on total loss absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\"), long-term debt (\"LTD\"), and clean holding company requirements for systemically important U.S. BHCs and intermediate holding companies (\"IHCs\") of systemically important foreign banking organizations (\"FBOs\"). SHUSA, as the IHC for Santander in the U.S., will be subject to these requirements.\nTLAC represents the amount of equity and debt a company must hold to facilitate its orderly liquidation. Under the Federal Reserve's proposal, the Company would be required to hold loss absorbing equity and unsecured debt of 18.5% of risk-weighted assets (\"RWAs\") by January 1, 2019 and then 20.5% of RWAs by January 1, 2022. These amounts represent the TLAC requirement (16% by January 1, 2019 and then 18% by January 1, 2022) plus a TLAC buffer of 2.5%. The Federal Reserve's proposal also establishes a requirement for the LTD component of the TLAC. The LTD requirement for the Company would be 7% of RWAs by January 1, 2019.\nThe comment period on the FRB's TLAC proposal ended on February 19, 2016.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards for Liquidity\nOn February 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve approved the final rule implementing certain of the EPS mandated by Section 165 of the DFA (the \"Final Rule\"). The Final Rule applies the EPS to (i) U.S. BHCs with $50 billion (and in some cases $10 billion) or more in total consolidated assets and (ii) foreign banking organizations (\"FBOs\") with a U.S. banking presence exceeding $50 billion in consolidated U.S. non-branch assets. The Final Rule implements, as new requirements for U.S. BHCs, risk management requirements (including requirements, duties and qualifications for a risk management committee and chief risk officer), liquidity stress testing and buffer requirements. U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more on June 30, 2014 were subject to the liquidity requirements as of January 1, 2015.\nFBOs\nOn February 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the Final Rule to strengthen regulatory oversight of FBOs. Under the Final Rule, FBOs with over $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets, including Santander, must consolidate U.S. subsidiary activities under a U.S. intermediate holding company (\"IHC\"). In addition, the Final Rule requires U.S. BHCs and FBOs with at least $50 billion in total U.S. consolidated non-branch assets to be subject to EPS and heightened capital, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander is subject to both of the above provisions of the Final Rule. As a result of this rule, Santander will transfer its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries currently outside of the Company to the Company, which will become an IHC. As required under the Final Rule, the Company submitted its IHC implementation plan to the Federal Reserve on December 31, 2014. A phased-in approach is being used for the standards and requirements at both the FBO and the IHC. As a U.S. BHC with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the Company was subject to EPS as of January 1, 2015. As permitted by the Final Rule, the IHC will be formed, with all but 10% of non-BHC assets included, by July 1, 2016. Other standards of the Final Rule will be phased in through January 1, 2018.\nBank Regulations\nAs a national bank, the Bank is subject to the OCC's regulations under the National Bank Act. The various laws and regulations administered by the OCC for national banks affect corporate practices and impose certain restrictions on activities and investments to ensure that the Bank operates in a safe and sound manner. These laws and regulations also require the Bank to disclose substantial business and financial information to the OCC and the public.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion reviews the Company's financial performance from a consolidated perspective over the past three years. This review is analyzed in the following two sections - \"Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\" and \"Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\" Each section includes a detailed income statement and segment results review. Key consolidated balance sheet trends are discussed in the \"Financial Condition\" section.\nWe have made certain corrections to previously disclosed amounts to correct for errors related to the allowance for credit losses, TDRs, and the classification of subvention payments related to leased vehicles.

Factors contributing to these changes were as follows:\n \u2022 Net interest income increased $787.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to the increased interest income on loans as a result of the growing RIC and auto loan portfolio. \n \u2022 The provision for credit losses increased $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to the continued growth in the RIC and auto loan portfolio and the related provisions for these portfolios. \n \u2022 Total non-interest income decreased $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the one-time net gain recognized in the first quarter of 2014 related to the Change in Control. \n \u2022 Total general and administrative expenses increased $967.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in lease expense and compensation and benefits throughout the year. \n \u2022 Other expenses increased $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an impairment charge of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $4.4 billion. \n \u2022 The income tax provision decreased $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease was due to the income tax provision on the gain on Change in Control that occurred in 2014 and the creation of a tax benefit from the impairment of goodwill in 2015. \nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company's non-generally accepted accounting principle (\"GAAP\") information has limitations as an analytical tool and, therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under GAAP as set forth in the Company's financial statements. These limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using this non-GAAP information only as a supplement to evaluate the Company's performance.\nThe Company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Company believes that there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by GAAP or codified in federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess the Company's capital adequacy using these ratios, the Company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company's capitalization to other organizations. However, because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, the Company's calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations, and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

This was primarily due to interest income earned on continued growth in the RIC and auto loan portfolio and one additional month of interest income on SC's loan portfolio in 2015 compared to 2014, offset by an increase in interest expense on debt obligations due to one additional month of interest expense on SC's debt obligations in 2015 compared to 2014.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nInterest Income on Investment Securities and Interest-Earning Deposits\nInterest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits increased $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The average balance of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $22.1 billion with an average yield of 1.85%, compared to an average balance of $15.5 billion with an average yield of 2.20% for the corresponding period in 2014. Overall, the increase in interest income on investment securities was primarily attributable to an increase of $63.1 million in collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\") as the average balance increased to $8.2 billion from $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014.\nInterest Income on Loans\nInterest income on loans increased $852.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to the growth in originations of the RIC and auto loans and unsecured loan portfolios. Interest income on the RIC and auto loans portfolio increased $862.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This was offset by a decrease in interest on residential mortgage loans of $96.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe average balance of total loans was $80.4 billion with an average yield of 9.46% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $73.3 billion with an average yield of 9.21% for the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in the average balance of total loans of $7.1 billion was primarily due to the growth of the RIC and auto loan portfolio. The average balance of RICs and auto loans, which comprised a majority of the increase, was $24.7 billion with an average yield of 20.36% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $19.9 billion with an average yield of 20.97% for the corresponding period in 2014.\nInterest Expense on Deposits and Related Customer Accounts\nInterest expense on deposits and related customer accounts increased $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The average balance of total interest-bearing deposits was $46.6 billion with an average cost of 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an average balance of $42.4 billion with an average cost of 0.49% for the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in interest expense on deposits and customer-related accounts during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the volume of deposit accounts, along with an increase in average interest rates.\nInterest Expense on Borrowed Funds\nInterest expense on borrowed funds increased $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due to a $9.9 billion increase in total average borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to $3.1 billion of new debt issued by SBNA and the Company and net $2.5 billion of SC securitization activity. The average balance of total borrowings was $44.4 billion with an average cost of 2.13% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an average balance of $34.5 billion with an average cost of 2.45% for the corresponding period in 2014.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

The ratio of net loan charge-offs to average total loans was 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2.2% for the corresponding period in 2014.\nConsumer loan net charge-offs as a percentage of average consumer loans increased to 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increases in consumer loan net charge-offs as a percentage of average consumer loans is primarily attributable to SC's personal unsecured loan portfolios being reclassified as held-for-sale, as well as the lower of cost or fair value adjustments on certain RICs and auto loans, which were reflected as charge-offs of $451.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 During the third quarter of 2015, SC determined that it no longer intended to hold its personal unsecured lending assets for investment. As a result, approximately $1.9 billion of personal unsecured loans were transferred to held-for-sale, net of a lower of cost or fair value adjustment of $377.6 million. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2015, the lower of cost or fair value adjustments associated with RIC and auto loan sales was $73.4 million. \nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

Future loan originations and purchases under SC's personal lending platform will also be classified as held-for-sale.\nCommercial loan net charge-offs as a percentage of average commercial loans, including multifamily loans, were less than 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to less than 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial fees\n</td> <td>187,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income, net\n</td> <td>107,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments (loss)/income, net\n</td> <td>(8,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td>57,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital markets revenue\n</td> <td>37,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease income\n</td> <td>1,477,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>798,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>175,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>540,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain recognized in earnings\n</td> <td>17,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,455,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,496,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,680,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-interest income decreased $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the one-time gain recognized in 2014, included in Net gain recognized in earnings, related to the Change in Control.\nConsumer Fees\nConsumer fees increased $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to the $84.7 million increase in loan servicing fees, which is largely attributable to the Company's growing RIC and auto loan portfolio. This growth was offset by a decrease in insurance service and consumer deposit fees.\nCommercial Fees\nCommercial fees consists of deposit overdraft fees, deposit ATM fees, cash management fees, letter of credit fees, and loan syndication fees for commercial accounts.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nMortgage banking income consisted of fees associated with servicing loans not held by the Company, as well as originations, amortization, and changes in the fair value of MSRs and recourse reserves. Mortgage banking income also included gains or losses on the sale of mortgage loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, and mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\"). Gains or losses on mortgage banking derivative and hedging transactions are also included in Mortgage banking income.\nMortgage banking revenue decreased $96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This change was primarily due to a decrease in the gain on sales of residential mortgage loans and related securities offset by an increase in the change in MSR fair value discussed in further detail below.\nSince 2013, mortgage interest rates have remained stable, resulting in relative stability in mortgage banking fee fluctuations from rate changes.\nThe following table details interest rates on certain residential mortgage loans for the Bank as of the dates indicated:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>30-Year Fixed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15-Year Fixed\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>3.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>3.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>3.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther factors, such as portfolio sales, servicing, and re-purchases, have continued to affect mortgage banking revenue.\nMortgage and multifamily servicing fees increased $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company serviced mortgage and multifamily real estate loans for the benefit of others with a principal balance totaling $858.2 million and $2.9 billion, respectively.\nNet gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and related securities decreased $97.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold $2.5 billion of mortgage loans for a gain of $47.6 million, compared to $3.3 billion of loans sold for a gain of $144.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe Company periodically sells qualifying mortgage loans to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"FHLMC\"), Government National Mortgage Association and Federal National Mortgage Association (\"FNMA\") in return for MBS issued by those agencies. The Company records these transactions as sales when the transfers meet all of the accounting criteria for a sale. For those loans sold to the agencies for which the Company retains the servicing rights, the Company recognizes the servicing rights at fair value. These loans are also generally sold with standard representation and warranty provisions, which the Company recognizes at fair value. Any difference between the carrying value of the transferred mortgage loans and the fair value of MBS, servicing rights, and representation and warranty reserves is recognized as gain or loss on sale.\nNet gains on sales of multifamily mortgage loans increased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $29.9 million release in the FNMA recourse reserve for the year ended December 31, 2015. The release of FNMA recourse reserves was attributable to the $1.4 billion purchases of multifamily mortgages during the third quarter from FNMA.\nThe Company previously sold multifamily loans in the secondary market to FNMA while retaining servicing. In September 2009, the Bank elected to stop selling multifamily loans to FNMA and, since that time, has retained all production for the multifamily loan portfolio. Under the terms of the multifamily sales program with FNMA, the Company retained a portion of the credit risk associated with those loans. As a result of that agreement, the Company retains a 100% first loss position on each multifamily loan sold to FNMA under the program until the earlier to occur of (i) the aggregate approved losses on the multifamily loans sold to FNMA reaching the maximum loss exposure for the portfolio as a whole or (ii) all of the loans sold to FNMA under the program are fully paid off.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company serviced loans with a principal balance of $552.1 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, for FNMA. These loans had a credit loss exposure of $34.4 million and $152.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and losses, if any, resulting from representation and warranty defaults would be in addition to the Company's credit loss exposure. The servicing asset for these loans has completely amortized.\nThe Company has established a liability related to the fair value of the retained credit exposure for multifamily loans sold to FNMA. This liability represents the amount the Company estimates it would have to pay a third party to assume the retained recourse obligation. The estimated liability represents the present value of the estimated losses the portfolio is projected to incur based upon internal specific information and an industry-based default curve with a range of estimated losses. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had a liability of $6.8 million and $40.7 million, respectively, related to the fair value of the retained credit exposure for multifamily loans sold to FNMA under this program.\nNet gains on hedging activities decreased $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the mortgage loan pipeline valuation and the Company's hedging strategy in the current mortgage rate environment.\nNet gains/(losses) from changes in MSR fair value increased $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The carrying value of the related MSRs at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $147.2 million and $145.0 million, respectively. The MSR asset fair value increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of increases in interest rates.\nThe Company recognized $24.7 million of principal reductions for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $22.0 million for the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was due to continued increases in prepayments and mortgage refinancing as a result of the anticipation of rising interest rates in the near future.\nEquity Method Investments (Loss) / Income, net\nEquity method investments (loss) / income, net decreased $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the Change in Control. In 2014 the Company included one month of accounting for SC as an equity method investment prior to the Change in Control. The Company began accounting for SC as a consolidated subsidiary beginning January 28, 2014. For further discussion see Item 1 Business.\nBOLI\nBOLI income represents fluctuations in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain employees. The Bank is the beneficiary and the recipient of the insurance proceeds. Income from BOLI decreased $2.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014.\nCapital Markets Revenue\nCapital markets revenue decreased $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in derivative trading accounts for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLease income\nLease income increased $679.4 million, on an average leased vehicle portfolio balance of $7.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an average balance of $4.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was the result of the Company's efforts to grow the lease portfolio.\nAs disclosed within Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year, the Company re-classified subvention payments from an addition to Lease income to a reduction to Lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nNet gain recognized in earnings\nNet gains recognized in earnings decreased $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the one-time gain the Company recognized in connection with the Change in Control during the first quarter of 2014. For additional information on the Change in Control, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe net gain for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily comprised of the sale of state and municipal securities with a book value of $421.5 million for a gain of $12.1 million, the sale of corporate debt securities with a book value of $566.2 million for a gain of $6.7 million, and the sale of asset-backed securities (\"ABS\") with a book value of $683.9 million for a loss of $0.2 million, offset by other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") of $1.1 million. The net gain realized for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily comprised of the sale of state and municipal securities with a book value of $89.0 million for a gain of $5.2 million, the sale of corporate debt securities with a book value of $219.6 million for a gain of $4.8 million, and the sale of MBS with a book value of $579.4 million for a gain of $13.1 million.\nMiscellaneous Income\nMiscellaneous income decreased $364.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $235.9 million decrease in fair value associated with the portfolio of loans that the Company accounts for at the fair value option (\"FVO\"). The decrease was also attributable to a reclassification that the Company made of their personal unsecured loans from held-for-investment (\"HFI\") to held-for-sale (\"HFS\") in the third quarter of 2015 and credit losses attributed to these portfolios.

Factors contributing to these increases were as follows:\n \u2022 Compensation and benefits expense increased $175.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the corresponding period in 2014. The primary driver of this increase was the Company's continued investment in personnel through increased salary, benefits and headcount. During the third quarter, the Company initiated a process to improve its operating efficiency, specifically focused on organizational simplification. As a result of this process, the Company incurred a severance accrual of $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the corresponding period in 2014. This was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $40.0 million which accounted for 56.5% of the increase. This was partially attributable to the second quarter of 2015. The Bank closed 29 branches located throughout its footprint in order to gain operational efficiencies. These closures resulted in accelerated depreciation expense of $7.6 million of related assets and a vacancy accrual charge of $6.4 million in the form of rent expense. \nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n \u2022 Outside services increased $82.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to increased consulting service fees that relate to regulatory-related initiatives, including preparation for meeting the requirements of the IHC implementation rules. Consulting fees increased $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was offset by a decrease in outside processing services. \n \u2022 Loan expense increased $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $68.4 million in collection expenses largely associated with the growing RIC and auto loan portfolio. The increase was offset by a decrease in loan servicing expenses. \n \u2022 Lease expense increased $524.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to the continued growth of the Company's leased vehicle portfolio. \nAs disclosed within Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year, the Company re-classified subvention payments from an addition to Lease income to a reduction to Lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.\n \u2022 Other administrative expenses increased $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was due to a $27.4 million increase of legal fees and a $24.8 million increase in non-income related tax expenses that were recognized throughout the year. This was offset by a $32.9 million decrease in employee expenses throughout the year. \nOTHER EXPENSES\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit insurance premiums and other expenses\n</td> <td>56,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of capitalized software\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>4,447,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment expense on affordable housing projects\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,580,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>348,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other expenses increased $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The primary factors contributing to the increase were:\nAmortization of intangibles increased $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a fourth quarter 2015 impairment of $11.7 million of the Company's indefinite-lived trade name. For further discussion on the impairment of this indefinite-lived trade name, please see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeposit insurance premiums expenses increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This variance was caused by a change in FDIC insurance premium rates and the assessment base for the Bank.\nThere were no losses on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $127.1 million of losses in the year ended December 31, 2014. This expense was primarily related to early termination fees incurred by the Company in association with the 2014 termination of legacy FHLB advances.\nThere was no impairment charges recorded on capitalized software during 2015. In the second quarter of 2014, an impairment of capitalized software charge of $97.5 million was recorded due to the restructuring of the Company's capitalized software.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $4.4 billion. For further discussion on this matter, see the section of the MD&A captioned \"Goodwill\".\nThe Company incurred an investment expense on affordable housing projects of $156 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. This expense was directly related to low income housing tax credit (\"LIHTC\") investments. This is attributed to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-01. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nINCOME TAX PROVISION\nAn income tax benefit of $671.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an income tax provision of $1.6 billion for the corresponding period in 2014. This resulted in effective tax rates of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 34.8% for the corresponding period in 2014.\nThe lower income tax provision in 2015 was primarily due to two drivers. In 2015, the Company recognized an impairment of the goodwill with respect to its investment in SC, which reduced the Company's deferred tax liability for the excess carrying value over its tax basis in the investment. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $982.9 million for the reduction in the deferred tax liability. In 2014, the Company recognized a tax expense of $917.5 million (approximately $841.7 million of which was deferred) on a book gain of $2.4 billion related to the Change in Control. The book gain was primarily due to the excess of fair value over the carrying value of the assets on SC's books at the time of the Change in Control. The $841.7 million of deferred tax liability would be recognized upon the Company's disposition of its interest in SC or if the goodwill associated with the Change in Control becomes impaired.\nThe lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven primarily by two components. The first was the 2015 impairment of goodwill related to the Company's investment in SC in the amount of $4.4 billion, which put the Company in a consolidated pretax loss position. The Company is not able to recognize a tax benefit for the impairment. In addition, the Company increased the reserve for income taxes under dispute with the United States for certain financing transactions by $104.2 million. Both of these items reduce the overall effective tax rate on a pretax base that is a loss.\nThe Company's effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nLINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS\nGeneral\nThe Company's segments at December 31, 2015 consisted of Retail Banking, Auto Finance & Business Banking, Real Estate and Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Banking (\"GCB\"), and SC. Prior to the closing of the IPO in January 2014, the Company accounted for its investment in SC under the equity method. Following the closing of the IPO, the Company consolidated the financial results of SC in the Company's financial statements, effective January 28, 2014. For additional information with respect to the Company's reporting segments, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nResults Summary\nRetail Banking\nNet interest income increased $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014.

Factors contributing to this increase are as follows:\n \u2022 Net interest income increased $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013 of which $4.4 billion is attributed to the Change in Control. \n \u2022 Provision for credit losses increased $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. This increase was due to the Change in Control. All other impacts were negligible. \n \u2022 Total non-interest income increased $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. This was primarily due to the gain recognized from the Change in Control of $2.4 billion (pre-tax) and increased fee and other income activity following the Change in Control of $1.5 billion. \n \u2022 Total general and administrative expenses increased $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. Of this, $1.6 billion was the result of activity added by the Change in Control. The remaining increase was primarily due to increased compensation and benefits, loan expenses and the addition of lease expense. \n \u2022 Other expenses increased $243.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. Approximately $49.6 million of this increase was the result of amortization on intangible assets added by the Change in Control. The remaining increase was primarily due to a one-time impairment of our capitalized software of $97.5 million and early termination fees from debt repurchases. \n \u2022 The income tax provision increased $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to the $654.9 million tax impact on provision from the Change in Control. \nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7.

The average balance of investment securities and interest-earning deposits for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $15.5 billion, which was a decrease of $2.5 billion, compared to an average balance of $18.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. Overall, the decrease in interest income on investment securities and the decrease in the average investment balance were primarily attributable to the sales of certain MBS and CMO investments occurring in the second half of 2013 and additional sales in 2014.\nThe average tax equivalent yield of investment securities and interest-earning deposits was 2.20% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2.09% for the corresponding period in 2013. The increase from the prior year reflects increasing coupons on investment securities spurred by economic improvement.\nInterest Income on Loans\nInterest income on loans increased $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. The increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to the Change in Control.\nThe average balance of total loans was $73.3 billion with an average yield of 9.21% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $50.9 billion with an average yield of 3.88% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the average balance of total loans was primarily due to the Change in Control. The average balance of retail installment contracts and auto loans, which comprised a majority of the increase, was $19.9 billion with an average yield of 20.97% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $169.3 million with an average yield of 7.42% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nInterest Expense on Deposits and Related Customer Accounts\nInterest expense on deposits and related customer accounts decreased $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.

The decrease in interest expense on deposits and customer-related accounts during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment as well as the Bank's continued focus on repositioning its account mix.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7.

The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due to the Change in Control, which accounted for $437.1 million of total interest expense on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowed funds of $162.8 million for the Bank and the Company for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of the Bank's use of the proceeds from the sale of investment securities to pay off existing borrowed funds. The average balance of total borrowings was $34.5 billion with an average cost of 2.45% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to an average balance of $14.4 billion with an average cost of 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provision for credit losses is based on credit loss experience, growth or contraction of specific segments of the loan portfolio, and the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.5 billion compared to $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe Company's net charge-offs increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. In connection with the Change in Control, the ratio of net loan charge-offs to average total loans increased to 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 0.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to the RIC and auto loan portfolio added from the Change in Control and the $1.4 billion of net charge-offs on that portfolio. Commercial loan net charge-offs as a percentage of average commercial loans was 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The consumer loan net charge-off ratio was 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in consumer charge-offs is primarily due to the credit quality of the RIC and auto loan portfolio added in the Change in Control, a majority of which are considered non-prime loans (defined by the Company as customers with Fair Isaac Corporation (\"FICO\") score of below 640). At December 31, 2014, 70% of the RIC and auto loan portfolio was comprised of non-prime loans.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial fees\n</td> <td>185,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income, net\n</td> <td>204,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments\n</td> <td>7,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>60,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital markets revenue\n</td> <td>51,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain recognized in earnings\n</td> <td>2,455,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease income\n</td> <td>798,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>540,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,680,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,088,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-interest income increased $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.

This decrease was primarily due to lower commercial deposit fees in 2014.\nMortgage Banking Revenue\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage and multifamily servicing fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and related securities\n</td> <td>144,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on sales of multifamily mortgage loans\n</td> <td>26,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains / (losses) on hedging activities\n</td> <td>13,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37,170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (losses) / gains from changes in MSR fair value\n</td> <td>(2,817\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MSR principal reductions\n</td> <td>(21,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,009\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total mortgage banking income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nMortgage banking income consisted of fees associated with servicing loans not held by the Company, as well as originations, amortization, and changes in the fair value of MSRs and recourse reserves. Mortgage banking income also includes gains or losses on the sale of mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, and MBS. Lastly, gains or losses on mortgage banking derivative and hedging transactions are also included in Mortgage banking income.\nMortgage banking revenue increased $82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the gain on sale of residential mortgage loans, as well as increased gains from hedging activities, partially offset by a decline in the fair value of MSRs.\nDuring 2012 and early 2013, there was significant volatility in mortgage interest rates which impacted the Company's mortgage banking revenue.\nSince mid-2013, these rates have stabilized, resulting in relative stability in mortgage banking fee fluctuations from rate changes.\nThe following table details certain residential mortgage rates for the Bank as of the dates indicated:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>30-Year Fixed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15-Year Fixed\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2013\n</td> <td>3.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2013\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2013\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>4.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>3.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther factors, such as portfolio sales, servicing, and re-purchases have continued to affect mortgage banking revenue.\nMortgage and multifamily servicing fees were relatively flat with a $1.2 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in the multifamily servicing portfolio. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company serviced multifamily real estate loans for the benefit of others totaling $2.9 billion and $4.6 billion.\nNet gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and related securities increased $90.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company sold $3.3 billion of loans for a gain of $144.9 million, compared to $4.0 billion of loans sold for a gain of $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe Company periodically sells qualifying mortgage loans to the FHLMC, GNMA and FNMA in return for MBS issued by those agencies. The Company records these transactions as sales when the transfers met all the accounting criteria for a sale. For those loans sold to the agencies for which the Company retains the servicing rights, the Company recognizes the servicing rights at fair value. These loans are also generally sold with standard representation and warranty provisions which the Company recognizes at fair value. Any difference between the carrying value of the transferred mortgage loans and the fair value of MBS, servicing rights, and representation and warranty reserves are recognized as gain or loss on sale.\nNet gains on sales of multifamily mortgage loans were $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the decrease in sales from 2013 to 2014.\nThe Company previously sold multifamily loans in the secondary market to FNMA while retaining servicing rights. In September 2009, the Bank elected to stop selling multifamily loans to FNMA and, since that time, has retained all production for the multifamily loan portfolio. Under the terms of the multifamily sales program with FNMA, the Company retained a portion of the credit risk associated with those loans. As a result of that agreement, the Company retains a 100% first loss position on each multifamily loan sold to FNMA under the program until the earlier to occur of (i) the aggregate approved losses on the multifamily loans sold to FNMA reaching the maximum loss exposure for the portfolio as a whole or (ii) all of the loans sold to FNMA under the program are fully paid off.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company serviced $2.6 billion and $4.3 billion, of loans for FNMA. These loans had a credit loss exposure of $152.8 million as of December 31, 2014 and $159.0 million as of December 31, 2013, and losses, if any, resulting from representation and warranty defaults would be in addition to the credit loss exposure. The servicing asset for these loans was completely amortized in 2012.\nThe Company has established a liability related to the fair value of the retained credit exposure for multifamily loans sold to FNMA. This liability represents the amount the Company estimated it would have to pay a third party to assume the retained recourse obligation. The estimated liability represents the present value of the estimated losses the portfolio is projected to incur based upon specific internal information and an industry-based default curve with a range of estimated losses. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had a liability of $40.7 million and $68.0 million, related to the fair value of the retained credit exposure for loans sold to FNMA under this program.\nNet gains/(losses) on hedging activities increased $51.0 million from a loss position in 2013 to a gain position for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to the mortgage rate environment and the significant decreases in the mortgage loan pipeline. Also contributing to the change was the Company's change in strategy during 2013 to hold mortgage loans originated as opposed to originating them for sale.\nNet gains/ (losses) from changes in MSR fair value decreased $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The carrying value of the related MSRs at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $145.0 million and $141.8 million, respectively. The MSR asset fair value decrease during 2014 was the result of decreased interest rates.\nMSR principal reductions resulted in a gain of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. The gain was due to the reduction in prepayments and mortgage refinancing.\nGain on Change in Control and Equity Method Investments\nPrior to the closing of the IPO in January 2014, the Company accounted for its investment in SC under the equity method. Following the closing of the IPO, the Company consolidated the financial results of SC in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements beginning with its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2014. In connection with the Change in Control, the Company recognized a gain of $2.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company recognized a gain of $7.8 million and $426.9 million on equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease of $419.0 million in equity method investment was due to the Change in Control, which resulted in accounting for SC as a consolidated subsidiary beginning January 28, 2014.\nBOLI\nBOLI income represents fluctuations in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain employees. The Bank is the beneficiary and the recipient of the insurance proceeds. Income from BOLI increased $3.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013.\nNet gain recognized in earnings\nNet gains recognized in earnings increased $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the Change in Control. For additional information on the Change in Control, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe net gain realized for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily comprised of the sale of state and municipal securities with a book value of $89.0 million for a gain of $5.2 million, the sale of corporate debt securities with a book value of $219.6 million for a gain of $4.8 million, and the sale of MBS with a book value of $579.4 million for a gain of $13.1 million. The net gain realized in for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily comprised of the sale of CMO with a book value of $4.1 billion for a gain of $69.0 million and the sale of corporate debt securities with a book value of $905.7 million for a gain of $34.7 million, offset by the OTTI charge of $63.6 million.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nLease Income\nLease income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $798.3 million. This is a result of the Change in Control, as the Company had no lease income prior to the Change in Control. In addition, during 2014, through a flow agreement with SC, SBNA began originating prime and super prime Chrysler Capital consumer vehicle leases which created lease income for the Bank.\nAs disclosed within Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year, the Company re-classified subvention payments from an addition to Lease income to a reduction to Lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.\nMiscellaneous Income\nMiscellaneous income increased $527.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. The increase is primarily due to the purchase accounting marks on fair value option (\"FVO\") loans associated with the Change in Control.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,216,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy and equipment expenses\n</td> <td>470,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expense\n</td> <td>163,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outside services\n</td> <td>195,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing expense\n</td> <td>52,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan expense\n</td> <td>348,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease expense\n</td> <td>588,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other administrative expenses\n</td> <td>317,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,351,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,662,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. Factors contributing to this increase are as follows:\n \u2022 Compensation and benefits expense increased $518.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Approximately $430.0 million of the increase was attributable to the Change in Control. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to the Company's investment in personnel through increased salary, headcount, and bonuses. \n \u2022 Occupancy and equipment expense increased $88.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Approximately $55.1 million was associated with the Change in Control. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher office occupancy, as well as continued higher property maintenance expenses in the periods following the Bank's rebranding. \n \u2022 Technology services expense increased $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to the Company's investments in our retail branch teller platform upgrades and also due to the Change in Control. \n \u2022 Outside services increased $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to significant consulting fees for CCAR implementation, cash balancing, and valuation services in connection with the Change in Control. \n \u2022 Loan expense increased $279.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes of loan servicing and loan originations for the retail installment contracts portfolio. \nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n \u2022 The Company incurred lease expense of $588.1 million in December 31, 2014. This is a result of the Change in Control. \nAs disclosed within Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year, the Company re-classified subvention payments from an addition to Lease income to a reduction to Lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.\n \u2022 Other administrative expenses increased $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to the Change in Control. \nOTHER EXPENSES\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit insurance premiums and other costs\n</td> <td>55,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>127,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>97,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>348,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other expenses increased $243.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended 2013. The primary factors contributing to the increase were:\n \u2022 Amortization of intangibles increased $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended 2013. This was primarily due to the addition of intangibles related to the Change in Control. \n \u2022 Deposit insurance premiums decreased $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended 2013. This decrease was primarily related to a lower FDIC insurance premium of $15.0 million, due to overall lower FDIC insurance premium rates and assessments compared to the prior year. \n \u2022 Loss on debt extinguishment increased by $120.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to early termination fees incurred by the Company in association with the 2014 termination of legacy FHLB advances. \n \u2022 Impairment of long lived assets resulted in a one-time impairment assets charge of $97.5 million in 2014. \nINCOME TAX PROVISION\nAn income tax provision of $1.6 billion was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $160.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, resulting in an effective tax rate of 34.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 20.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe higher income tax provision in 2014 was due to several factors. First, the Company recognized tax expense of $917.5 million (approximately $841.7 million of which was deferred) on book gains of $2.4 billion related to the Change in Control. The book gain was primarily due to the excess of fair value over the carrying value of the assets on SC's books at the time of the Change in Control. The $841.7 million of deferred tax liability would be recognized upon the Company's disposition of its interest in SC or if the goodwill associated with the Change in Control becomes impaired. The income tax provision also increased by $654.9 million in 2014 due to the inclusion of the operating income of SC (as adjusted for purchase accounting) in SHUSA's pre-tax income, as a result of SC's consolidation into SHUSA's financial statements. When SC was previously presented as an equity method investment, SHUSA included SC's net income in SHUSA's presentation of pre-tax income. The impact of these two items was partially offset by a decline in SHUSA's (excluding SC) operating pre-tax earnings (excluding the gain recognized from the Change in Control) versus that of 2013, which caused a decrease in tax expense of $178.4 million.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe higher effective tax rate in 2014 was driven primarily by two factors related to the Change in Control. The consolidation of SC highlights the impact of double taxation on SC's operating income because the consolidated financial statements include the taxes paid by SC as well as the taxes accrued by SHUSA on its share of SCUSA's earnings. This was not reflected under equity-method accounting, which was applicable to SHUSA's 2013 consolidated financial statements. When compared to the results of 2013, the impact of this presentation resulted in an increase in the ETR of approximately 9%. In addition, the significant increase in the pre-tax income resulting from the Change in Control and the inclusion of the operating income of SC reduced the relative impact of favorable permanent tax differences (e.g., tax-exempt income and tax credits). When compared to 2013, the dilution effect of the higher pretax income from these two items on the favorable permanent items resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate (\"ETR\") of approximately 7%. The impact of these two items was partially offset by a decrease of approximately 3% related to state and local taxes, which was due to SC being taxable in jurisdictions with lower tax rates relative to SHUSA's historical filing group and changes in law in both New York State and Massachusetts, which had an overall favorable impact on the Company. It is expected that the Company's ETR will trend higher than for years 2013 and earlier due to the level of income produced by SC that contributes to the dilution effect described above.\nThe Company's effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nLINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS\nGeneral\nThe Company's segments at December 31, 2014 consisted of Retail Banking, Auto Finance & Alliances, Real Estate and Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Banking (\"GCB\"), and SC. Prior to the closing of the IPO in January 2014, the Company accounted for its investment in SC under the equity method. Following the closing of the IPO, the Company consolidated the financial results of SC in the Company's financial statements, effective January 28, 2014. For additional information with respect to the Company's reporting segments, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the first quarter of 2014, certain management and business line changes were announced as the Company reorganized its management reporting in order to improve its structure and focus to better align management teams and resources with the business goals of the Company and to provide enhanced customer service to its clients. These changes became effective for reporting purposes during the second quarter of 2014. Accordingly, the following changes were made within the Company's reportable segments:\n \u2022 The Investment Services business unit was combined with the Retail Banking business unit. \n \u2022 The CEVF line, formerly included in the Specialty and Government Banking business unit, was moved into the Auto Finance and Alliances business unit and \n \u2022 The Specialty and Government Banking business unit was combined with the Real Estate and Commercial Banking business unit. \nAccordingly, prior period information has been recast for comparability.\nResults Summary\nRetail Banking\nNet interest income decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The average balance of the Retail Banking segment's gross loans was $16.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $18.1 billion in 2013. The average balance of deposits was $31.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $32.9 billion for 2013. Total non-interest income increased $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the increase in the sales of mortgage loans and MBS. The provision for credit losses decreased $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Total expenses decreased $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to increased rent, increased grounds maintenance, re-stocking of branch materials in 2014 mainly due to the Bank's rebranding in 2013, and leasehold improvements in the branches.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nTotal average assets for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $17.7 billion, compared to $18.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by the decreases within the mortgage loan portfolio.\nAuto Finance & Alliances\nNet interest income increased $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, driven primarily by the Chrysler Capital dealer floor-plan business line launched in the third quarter of 2013. Total average gross loans were $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $5.2 billion in 2013. Total non-interest income increased $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to the launch of the indirect leasing segment in 2014. The provision for credit losses decreased $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013. Total expenses increased $238.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to the depreciation expense from operating lease assets associated with the launch of the indirect leasing business in 2014.\nTotal average assets were $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to the launch of the indirect leasing segment in 2014. Total average deposits were $6,741.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $6,377.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nReal Estate and Commercial Banking\nNet interest income increased $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Driven by growth in the multifamily portfolio, the average balance of this segment's gross loans increased to $20.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $19.6 billion in 2013. Growth in government banking drove the average balance of deposits to $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $6.8 billion in 2013. Total non-interest income decreased $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. This decline was primarily related to a decrease of serviced portfolio reserve releases in 2014 compared to 2013. The release of credit losses was $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a release of $52.4 million for 2013.

The average balance of this segment's gross loans was $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $7.1 billion in 2013, with the increase primarily driven by growth in the Large Corporate portfolio. The average balance of deposits was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $800.1 million in 2013. Total non-interest income increased $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013.

Total non-interest income increased $152.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Total expenses increased $359.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013.\nAverage assets were $26.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $28.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSC\nFrom December 31, 2011 until January 28, 2014, SC was accounted for as an equity method investment. In 2014, SC's results of operations were consolidated with SHUSA. SC is managed as a separate business unit, with its own systems and processes, and is reported as a separate segment.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nMD&A is based on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments, and accordingly, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. However, the Company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. Management identified accounting for consolidation, business combinations, allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, goodwill, derivatives and hedging activities and income taxes as the Company's most critical accounting policies and estimates, in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Company's Audit Committee. Information concerning the Company's implementation and impact of new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") is discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidation\nThe purpose of consolidated financial statements is to present the results of operations and the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as if the consolidated group were a single economic entity. There is a presumption that consolidated financial statements are more meaningful than separate financial statements and that they are usually necessary for a fair presentation when one of the entities in the consolidated group directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest in the other entities.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nIn accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, the consolidated financial statements include any Voting Rights Entities (VOEs) in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and any VIEs for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company generally consolidates its VIEs if the Company has: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary). The Company generally consolidates its VOEs if the Company, directly or indirectly, owns more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the legal entity and the noncontrolling shareholders do not hold any substantive participating or controlling rights. VIEs and VOEs can include equity interests in corporations, and similar legal entities, and partnerships and similar legal entities, subordinated debt, derivative contracts, leases, service agreements, guarantees, standby letters of credit, loan commitments, and other contracts, agreements and financial instruments.\nUpon occurrence of certain significant events, as required by the VIE model the Company reassesses whether a legal entity in which the Company is involved with is a VIE. The reassessment also considers whether the Company has acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the legal entities with which the Company is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE, depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.\nThe Company uses the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if the Company has significant influence over the entity's operating and financing decisions but does not maintain control. Unconsolidated investments in VOEs or VIEs in which the Company has a voting or economic interest of less than 20% are generally carried at cost. These investments are included in \"Equity method investments\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Company's proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nIn July 2009, Santander contributed SC to the Company. SC's results of operations were consolidated with the Company's from January 2009 until December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, SC was accounted for as an equity-method investment. The Company continued to account for SC as an equity-method investment through December 31, 2013. Refer to Note 8, Equity Method Investments, Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the re-consolidation of SC effective in January 2014.\nIn accordance with ASC 810-10, Consolidation, the Company performs an analysis on a quarterly basis of each variable interest to determine if it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Those entities in which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary are consolidated, and, accordingly, the entity's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no VIEs for which the Company was considered the primary beneficiary.\nInvestments in non-consolidated affiliates, including VIEs, are generally accounted for using the equity-method.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and records the identifiable assets, liabilities and any non-controlling interests of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded prior to the finalization of a more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements will be adjusted retrospectively. All acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. The application of business combination principles including the determination of the fair value of the net assets acquired requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Please see related discussion under the caption Goodwill below.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nThe ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments represent management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of SHUSA's ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is regularly evaluated. This evaluation process is subject to several estimates and applications of judgment. Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb loan and lease losses takes into consideration the risks inherent in the loan portfolio, past loan and lease loss experience, loans that have loss potential, delinquency trends, economic conditions, the level of originations and other relevant factors. Management also considers loan quality, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, the amount of non-performing loans, and industry trends. Changes in these estimates could have a direct material impact on the provision for credit losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and/or could result in a change in the recorded allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the periods presented is included in the Credit Risk Management section of this MD&A.\nThe ALLL consists of two elements: (i) an allocated allowance, which is comprised of allowances established on loans individually evaluated for impairment (specific reserves) and loans collectively evaluated for impairment (general reserves) based on historical loan and lease loss experience adjusted for current trends general economic conditions and other risk factors, and (ii) an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Reserve levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly by Board-level committees.\nThe Company's allocated reserves are principally based on its various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee, and inputs are reviewed periodically by the Company's internal audit function. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Committee.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe Company's unallocated allowance is no more than 5% of the overall allowance. This is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the Company's entire loan and lease portfolio. Imprecisions include loss factors inherent in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance, as well as potential variability in estimates. Period-to-period changes in the Company's historical unallocated allowance for loan and lease loss positions are considered in light of these factors.\nLoan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructuring\nTDRs are loans that have been modified for which the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to customers to both meet the needs of the customers and maximize the ultimate recovery of the loan. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified involving a concession that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. Commercial and consumer TDRs are generally placed on non-accrual status until the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is reasonably assured and a sustained period of repayment performance has been achieved (typically defined as six months for a monthly amortizing loan). RIC TDRs are generally placed on non-accrual status until they become 60 days or less past due. All costs incurred by the Company in connection with a TDR are expensed as incurred. The TDR classification remains on the loan until it is paid in full or liquidated.\nCommercial Loan TDRs\nAll of the Company's commercial loan modifications are based on the circumstances of the individual customer, including specific customers' complete relationship with the Company. Loan terms are modified to meet each borrower's specific circumstances at a point in time and may allow for modifications such as term extensions, interest rate reductions, etc. Modifications for commercial loan TDRs generally, although not always, result in bifurcation of the original loan into A and B notes. The A note is restructured to allow for an upgraded risk rating and return to accrual status after a sustained period of payment performance has been achieved (typically six months for monthly payment schedules). The B note, if any, is structured as a deficiency note and the balance is charged off but the debt is usually not forgiven. As TDRs, they will be subject to analysis for specific reserves by either calculating the present value of expected future cash flows or, if collateral-dependent, calculating the fair value of the collateral less its estimated cost to sell. The TDR classification will remain on the loan until it is paid in full or liquidated.\nConsumer Loan TDRs\nThe primary modification program for the Company's residential mortgage and home equity portfolios is a proprietary program designed to keep customers in their homes and, when appropriate, prevent them from entering into foreclosure. The program is available to all customers facing a financial hardship regardless of their delinquency status. The main goal of the modification program is to review the customer's entire financial condition to ensure that the proposed modified payment solution is affordable according to a specific debt-to-income (\"DTI\") ratio range. The main modification benefits of the program allow for term extensions, interest rate reductions, and/or deferment of principal. The Company reviews each customer on a case-by-case basis to determine which benefit or combination of benefits will be offered to achieve the target DTI range.\nConsumer TDRs in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are generally placed on non-accrual status until the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is reasonably assured and a sustained period of repayment performance has been achieved (typically six months for a monthly amortizing loan). Any loan that has remained current for the six months immediately prior to modification will remain on accrual status after the modification is implemented. The TDR classification will remain on the loan until it is paid in full or liquidated.\nIn addition to those identified as TDRs above, accounting guidance also requires loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be considered TDRs and collateral-dependent, regardless of delinquency status. These loans must be written down to fair market value and classified as non-accrual/non-performing for the remaining life of the loan.\nFor the Company's other consumer portfolios, including RIC and auto loans, the terms of the modifications generally include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan at a rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk or an extension of the maturity date.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nRICs were a new portfolio for the Company in 2014 as a result of the Change in Control. The RIC and auto loan portfolio is primarily comprised of nonprime loans which lead to a higher rate of modifications and deferrals, and thus a higher volume of TDRs, than other portfolios. Loan portfolios acquired as part of a business combination like the Change in Control cannot be designated as TDRs under U.S. GAAP at the Change in Control date. As a result, the increase is primarily driven by RICs and auto loans originated prior to the Change in Control date which received their first modification, deferral greater than 90 days or second deferral subsequent to the Change in Control date during the reporting period. As a percentage of the RIC and auto loan portfolio recorded investment, there have been no significant increases in modification or deferral activity during the reporting period. The increased TDR activity at SHUSA may continue until the loan portfolios acquired as part of the Change in Control runoff.\nIn accordance with our policies and guidelines, the Company, at times, offer extensions (deferrals) to consumers on our RICs, whereby the consumer is allowed to defer a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan. More than 90% of deferrals granted are for two payments. Our policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral that may be granted to one deferral every six months, regardless of the length of any prior deferral. The maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile RICs is eight, while some marine and recreational vehicle contracts have a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term. Additionally, we generally limit the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received. During the deferral period, we continue to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement.\nAt the time a deferral is granted, all delinquent amounts may be deferred or paid, resulting in the classification of the loan as current and therefore not considered a delinquent account. Thereafter, such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account.\nThe Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio.\nChanges in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts for loans classified as TDRs used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and related provision for loan and lease losses. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan and lease losses and related provision for loan and lease losses.\nTDR Impact to Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is established to recognize losses inherent in funded loans intended to be held for investment that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Prior to loans being placed in TDR status, the Company generally measures its allowance under a loss contingency methodology in which consumer loans with similar risk characteristics are pooled and loss experience information is monitored for credit risk and deterioration with statistical tools considering factors such as delinquency, loan-to-value (\"LTV\") and credit scores.\nUpon TDR modification, the Company generally measures impairment based on a present value of expected future cash flows methodology considering all available evidence using the effective interest rate or fair value of collateral. The amount of the required valuation allowance is equal to the difference between the loan's impaired value and the recorded investment.\nWhen a consumer TDR subsequently defaults, the Company generally measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if applicable, less its estimated cost to sell.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nTypically, commercial loans whose terms are modified in a TDR will have been identified as impaired prior to modification and accounted for generally using a present value of expected future cash flows methodology, unless the loan is considered collateral-dependent. Loans considered collateral-dependent are measured for impairment based on their fair values of the collateral less its estimated cost to sell. Accordingly, upon TDR modification or if a TDR modification subsequently defaults, the allowance methodology remains unchanged.\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather are subject to periodic impairment testing.\nAs more fully described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. The Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 1, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As of December 31, 2015, the reporting units with assigned goodwill were Retail Banking, Auto Finance and Business Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Corporate and Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Banking, and SC.\nUnder ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, an entity's goodwill impairment analysis must be completed in two steps unless the entity determines, based on certain qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, including goodwill, and that no impairment exists. In that case the two-step process may be bypassed. It is worth noting that an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the preceding qualitative assessment (often referred to as \"Step 0\") for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test. The Company did not apply the provisions of Step 0 in its 2015 goodwill impairment analysis.\nThe first step of ASC 350 (\"Step 1\") analysis requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including its allocated goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment exists and a second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any, for that reporting unit. The Company utilizes the market approach to determine the fair value of its SC reporting unit as it is a publicly traded company that has a single reporting unit. Determining the fair value of the remaining reporting units requires significant valuation inputs, assumptions, and estimates.\nThe Company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a risk-based capital approach. Certain of the Company's assets are assigned to a Corporate / Other category. These assets are related to the Company's corporate-only programs, such as BOLI, and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit.\nWhen required, the second step of testing (\"Step 2\") involves calculating the implied fair value of each of the affected reporting units. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that is recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired. If the implied fair value of goodwill is in excess of the reporting unit's allocated goodwill amount, then no impairment charge is required. If the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. A recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nGoodwill impairment testing involves management's judgment, to the extent that it requires an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value. This is performed using widely-accepted valuation techniques, such as the guideline public company market approach (earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies), the market capitalization approach (share price of the reporting unit and control premium of comparable public companies), and the income approach (the discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") method).\nThe Company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units. Several factors are taken into account, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, and market data.\nThe guideline public company market approach (\"market approach\") included earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the Company's reporting units. In addition, the market capitalization plus control premium approach was applied to the Company's SC reporting unit as the SC reporting unit is a publicly traded subsidiary whose securities are traded in an active market.\nIn connection with the market capitalization plus control premium approach applied to the Company's SC reporting unit, the Company used SC's stock price as of the date of the annual impairment analysis. The Company also considered historical auto loan industry transactions and control premiums over the last three years in determining the control premium.\nThe DCF method of the income approach incorporated the reporting units' forecasted cash flows, including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts. The discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units' cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model. Significant inputs to this model include a risk-free rate of return, beta (which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit), market equity risk premium, and, in certain cases, additional premium for size and/or unsystematic Company specific risk factors. The Company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets. The Company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. The Company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, so actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nAll of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impacts the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units include such items as:\n \u2022 a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate; \n \u2022 an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; \n \u2022 volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and \n \u2022 unexpected regulatory changes. \nRefer to the Financial Condition, Goodwill section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further details on the Company's Goodwill, including the results of Management's goodwill impairment analyses.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nSHUSA and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments as part of the risk management process to manage risk associated with financial assets and liabilities and mortgage banking activities, to assist commercial banking customers with risk management strategies, and for certain other market exposures.\nDerivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk (such as interest rate risk) are considered fair value hedges. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. The Company formally documents the relationships of qualifying hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nFair value hedges that are highly effective are accounted for by recording the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the related hedged asset, liability or firm commitment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the corresponding income or expense recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the fair value of the derivative is recorded as an other asset or other liability. Actual cash receipts or payments and related amounts accrued during the period on derivatives included in a fair value hedge relationship are recorded as adjustments to the income or expense associated with the hedged asset or liability.\nCash flow hedges that are highly effective are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset or liability, with a corresponding charge or credit, net of tax, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholder's equity on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Where certain cash flow hedging relationships have been terminated, the Company continues to defer the net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassifies it into Interest expense as the future cash flows occur, unless it becomes probable that the future cash flows will not occur.\nThe portion of gains and losses on derivative instruments not considered highly effective in hedging the change in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item, or derivatives not designated in hedging relationships, are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, the Company had cash flow and fair value hedges recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Other assets\u201d or Other liabilities,\u201d as applicable. For both fair value and cash flow hedges, certain assumptions and forecasts related to the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange and credit risk on the fair value of the derivative and the item being hedged must be documented at the inception of the hedging relationship to demonstrate that the derivative instrument will be effective in hedging the designated risk. If these assumptions or forecasts do not accurately reflect subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument or the designated item being hedged, the Company might be required to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for that derivative instrument. Once hedge accounting is terminated, all subsequent changes in the fair market value of the derivative instrument must be recorded in earnings, possibly resulting in greater volatility in earnings. If outstanding derivative positions that qualified for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2015 were no longer considered effective, and thus did not qualify for hedge accounting, the impact in 2015 would have been to lower pre-tax earnings by a net of $14.1 million.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply or will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse or be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance will be established if the Company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires periodic analysis of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and when the deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. Consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets. The critical assumptions used in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis were as follows: (a) the expectations of future earnings (b) estimates of the Company's long-term annual growth rate, based on the Company's long-term economic outlook in the U.S.; (c) estimates of the dividend income payout ratio from the Company's consolidated subsidiary, SC, based on the current policies and practices of SC; (d) estimates of book income to tax income differences, based on the analysis of historical differences and the historical timing of the reversal of temporary differences; (e) the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid; (f) estimates of tax credits to be earned on current investments, based on the Company's evaluation of the credits applicable to each investment; (g) experience with operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards not expiring unused; (h) estimates of applicable state tax rates based on current/most recent enacted tax rates and state apportionment calculations; (i) tax planning strategies and (j) current tax laws. Significant judgment is required to assess future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe Company bases its expectations of future earnings, which are used to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets, on financial performance forecasts of its operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees. The budgets and estimates used in these forecasts are approved by the Company's management, and the assumptions underlying the forecasts are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as necessary based on current developments or when new information becomes available. The updates made and the variances between the Company's forecasts and its actual performance have not been significant enough to alter the Company's conclusions with regard to the realizability of its deferred tax asset including the effect of the SC Transaction that occurred in 2011 and the Change in Control that occurred in the first quarter of 2014. The Company continues to forecast sufficient taxable income to fully realize its current deferred tax assets. Forecasted taxable income is subject to changes in overall market and global economic conditions.\nIn establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws in the U.S., its states and municipalities, and abroad. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending on changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company reviews its tax balances quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Interest and penalties on income tax payments are included within income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the related tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the Company's income taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLOAN PORTFOLIO\nThe Company's loan portfolio(1) consisted of the following at the

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nOver the last five years, our overall loan portfolio has increased $31.0 billion or 60.0%, primarily driven by the Change in Control in 2014 which resulted in approximately $22.0 billion of loans being consolidated at the time of the Change in Control. In the commercial loans (excluding multifamily loans) portfolio, the portfolio has increased $8.5 billion or 37.2%, primarily attributable to organic growth in the C&I portfolio over the last two years of $5.7 billion, with the primary driver in the C&I portfolio being the GCB segment. In the multifamily portfolio, the portfolio has increased $2.3 billion or 32.9%, primarily attributable to repurchases from FNMA of $2.2 billion. For the consumer portfolios, consumer loans secured by real estate have decreased $5.9 billion or 31.8%, primarily attributable to securitization transactions of $3.8 billion. Consumer loans not secured by real estate have increased $26.1 billion or 799.0%, primarily attributable to the Change in Control at SC in 2014 when $20.9 billion of RIC and auto loans and $1.0 billion of personal unsecured loans were consolidated by the Company.\nCommercial\nCommercial loans (excluding multifamily loans) increased approximately $3.3 billion, or 11.9%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The primary driver was organic growth exceeding repayment and runoff activity in the commercial and industrial and other commercial portfolios by $2.6 billion and $325.0 million, respectively.\nMultifamily loans increased $732.6 million, or 8.4%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. This increase from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the $1.4 billion repurchase of FNMA loans during the third quarter of 2015, offset by loan repayment and runoff activity exceeding originations by $677.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents the contractual maturity of the Company's commercial loans at December 31, 2015:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, MATURING\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>In One Year\nOr Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,828,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,102,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,791,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,722,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,474,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,726,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,348,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,548,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>775,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,712,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,950,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,438,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,078,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,541,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,089,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,709,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans with:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,185,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,383,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,799,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,368,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,892,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,158,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,290,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,341,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,078,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,541,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,089,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,709,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes LHFS.\nConsumer\nConsumer loans secured by real estate decreased $561.6 million, or 4.3%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The primary drivers of the decrease from December 31, 2014 were related to the Residential Mortgage portfolio, specifically loan sales of $2.5 billion and runoff of $1.2 billion exceeding originations of $3.2 billion.\nThe consumer loan portfolio not secured by real estate increased $2.9 billion, or 10.9%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The primary driver of the increase from December 31, 2014 was the RIC and auto loan portfolio, specifically originations of $22.1 billion exceeding paydowns and charge-off activity of $11.7 billion and sales of $7.9 billion.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nAs of December 31, 2015, 69.0% of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio was nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a Fair Isaac Corporation (\"FICO\") score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. While underwriting guidelines were designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, the nonprime loans, nonetheless, will experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decrease consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weakening collateral values and increasing losses in the event of default. Because SC's historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as FICO, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. We experienced a default rate of 8.3% for nonprime RIC and auto loans and 2.9% for prime RIC and auto loans during the period ended December 31, 2015.\nIn early 2015, we increased our origination volume of RICs to borrowers with limited credit experience, such as those with less than 36 months of credit history or less than four trade lines. For these borrowers, many of whom do not have a FICO\u00ae score, other factors such as the LexisNexis risk view score, loan-to-value ratio, and payment-to-income ratio are utilized to assign an internal credit score. Our risk-based pricing methodology generally captures these credit bureau attributes in establishing a risk appropriate annual percentage rate at the time of origination. Origination volume of RICs with less than four trade lines and less than 36 months of credit history was $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Remaining unpaid principal balance of these loans was $4.8 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our credit loss allowance forecasting models are not calibrated for this higher concentration of RICs with limited bureau information and, accordingly, as of December 31, 2015, we recorded a qualitative adjustment of $158 million, increasing the allowance ratio on individually acquired retail installment contracts by 0.6% of unpaid principal balance. This adjustment was necessary to increase the estimated credit loss allowance for additional charge offs expected on this portfolio, based on the loss performance information available to date, which evidences higher losses in the first months after origination for these RICs in comparison to RICs with standard bureau attributes. This qualitative adjustment was informed by the deteriorating loss trends of the 2015 vintages over a subsequent twelve month forecast horizon. Under assumed scenarios if losses from such 2015 vintages were to increase by 10% and 20%, the allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $130 million and $261 million, respectively.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Score Range(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail installment contracts and auto loans(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail installment contracts and auto loans(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Standard file(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Standard file(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Standard file(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Standard file(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>No FICOs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td><600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>600-639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>640-679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Consists primarily of loans for which credit scores are not considered in the ALLL model.\n(2) Credit scores updated quarterly.\n(3) RICs loans include $905.7 million and $45.4 million of LHFS at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, that do not have an allowance.\n(4) Defined as borrowers with greater than 36 months of credit history or four or more trade lines\n(5) Defined as borrowers with less than 36 months of credit history or less than four trade lines.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nAt December 31, 2015, a typical RIC was originated with an average annual percentage rate (APR) of 16.9% and was purchased from the dealer at a discount of 2.5%. All of the Company's RICs and auto loans are fixed rate loans.\nNonprime RICs and personal unsecured loans have a higher inherent risk of loss than prime loans. The Company records an allowance for loan and lease losses to cover its estimate of inherent losses on its RIC incurred as of the balance sheet date on its RICs. As of September 30, 2015, SC's personal unsecured portfolio was transferred to held for sale and thus does not have a related allowance. The inclusion of SC's nonprime loans within the Company's loan portfolio effective upon the Change in Control in 2014, among other things, resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans held for investment from 2.3% at December 31, 2014 to 3.9% at December 31, 2015.\nAs a result of the strategic evaluation of SC's personal lending portfolio, in the third quarter of 2015, SC began reviewing strategic alternatives for exiting its personal loan portfolios. In connection with this review, on October 9, 2015, SC delivered a 90-day notice of termination of its loan purchase agreement with LendingClub. On February 1, 2016, it completed the sale of substantially all of our LendingClub loans to a third-party buyer at an immaterial premium to par value. The portfolio was comprised of personal installment loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThe other significant personal lending relationship is with Bluestem. Management continues to perform in accordance with the terms and operative provisions of the agreements under which we are obligated to purchase personal revolving loans originated by Bluestem for a term ending in 2020, or 2022 if extended at Bluestem's option. These and other, smaller, revolving loan portfolios are carried as held for sale in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has recorded lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on these portfolios, and there may be further such adjustments required in future periods' financial statements. Management is currently evaluating alternatives for the Bluestem portfolio.\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\nExtending credit to customers exposes the Company to credit risk, which is the risk that contractual principal and interest due on loans will not be collected due to the inability or unwillingness of the borrower to repay the loan. The Company manages credit risk in its loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards, guidelines, and limitations established by the Company's Board of Directors as set forth in its Board-approved Risk Tolerance Statement. Written loan policies establish underwriting standards, lending limits, and other standards or limits deemed necessary and prudent. Various approval levels based on the amount of the loan and other key credit attributes have also been established. In order to ensure consistency and quality in accordance with the Company's credit and governance standards, authority to approve loans is shared jointly between the businesses and the credit risk group. Loans over certain dollar thresholds require approval by the Company's credit committees, with higher balance loans requiring approval by more senior level committees.\nThe Credit Risk Review group conducts ongoing independent reviews of the credit quality of the Company's loan portfolios and credit management processes to ensure the accuracy of the risk ratings and adherence to established policies and procedures, verify compliance with applicable laws and regulations, provide objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, and ensure that proper documentation exists. The results of these periodic reviews are reported to business line management, Risk Management and the Audit Committee of both the Company and the Bank. The Company maintains a classification system for loans that identifies those requiring a higher level of monitoring by management because of one or more factors, including borrower performance, business conditions, industry trends, the nature of the collateral, collateral margin, economic conditions, or other factors. Loan credit quality is subject to scrutiny by line management, credit risk professionals, and Internal Audit.\nThe following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and addresses SHUSA's strategies for managing the related credit risk. Additional credit risk management related considerations are discussed further in the \"Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\" section of this MD&A.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nCommercial Loans\nCommercial loans principally represent commercial real estate loans (including multifamily loans), loans to commercial and industrial customers, and automotive dealer floor plan loans. Credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing and expected economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk SHUSA is willing to assume. To manage credit risk when extending commercial credit, the Company focuses on assessing the borrower's capacity and willingness to repay and obtaining sufficient collateral. Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by the borrower's assets and by personal guarantees. Commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within the Mid-Atlantic, New York, and New England market areas and are secured by real estate at specified loan-to-value (\"LTV\") ratios and often by a guarantee of the borrower.\nManagement closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that significant credit concentrations by borrowers or industries are mitigated. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, 22.3% and 20.1%, respectively, of the commercial loan portfolio, excluding multifamily, was unsecured.\nConsumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\nCredit risk in the direct and indirect consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels, the creditworthiness of the borrower, and collateral values. In the home equity loan portfolio, combined loan-to-value (\"CLTV\") ratios are generally limited to 90% for both first and second liens. SHUSA originates and purchases fixed-rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that are secured by the underlying 1-4 family residential properties. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-equity ratios, credit scores, and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than 80%. Residential mortgage loans originated or purchased in excess of an 80% LTV ratio are generally insured by private mortgage insurance, unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the Federal, state, or local government. SHUSA also utilizes underwriting standards which comply with those of FHLMC or FNMA. Credit risk is further reduced, since a portion of the Company's fixed-rate mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse.\nConsumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\nThe Company's consumer loans not secured by real estate include acquired RIC from manufacturer franchised dealers in connection with their sale of used and new automobiles and trucks as well as acquired consumer marine and RV and credit card loans. Credit risk is mitigated to the extent possible through early and aggressive collection practices, which includes the repossession of vehicles.\nCollections\nThe Company closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality. Collection efforts generally begin within 15 days after a loan payment is missed by attempting to contact all borrowers and offer a variety of loss mitigation alternatives. If these attempts fail, the Company will attempt to gain control of any and all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses. While liquidation and recovery efforts continue, officers continue to work with the borrowers, if appropriate, to recover all money owed to the Company. The Company monitors delinquency trends at 30, 60, and 90 days past due. These trends are discussed at monthly management Credit Risk Review Committee meetings and at the Company's and the Bank's Board of Directors' meetings.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.

Potential problem loans are loans not currently classified as NPLs for which management has doubts about the borrowers' ability to comply with the present repayment terms. These assets are principally loans delinquent more than 30 days but less than 90 days. Potential problem commercial loans totaled approximately $57.1 million and $71.8 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Potential problem consumer loans amounted to $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Management has included these loans in its evaluation and reserved for them during the respective periods.\nNon-performing assets increased during the period, to $1.9 billion, or 1.5% of total assets, at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.8 billion, or 1.5% of total assets, at December 31, 2014, primarily attributable to an increase in NPLs in the retail installment contract and auto loan portfolio, offset by decreases in the commercial loans and consumer loans secured by real estate portfolios.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nGeneral\nNon-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and leases (\"NPLs\"), which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, other real estate owned (\"OREO\") properties, and other repossessed assets. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is reversed, with accruals charged against earnings. The Company generally places all commercial loans and consumer loans secured by real estate on non-performing status at 90 days past due for interest, principal or maturity, or earlier if it is determined that the collection of principal or interest on the loan is in doubt. For certain individual portfolios, including the RIC portfolio, non-performing status will begin at 60 days past due. Personal unsecured loans, including credit cards, generally continue to accrue interest until they are 180 days delinquent, at which point they are charged-off and all interest is removed from interest income.\nIn general, when the borrower's ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer believed to be in doubt, the loan or lease is returned to accrual status. Generally, commercial loans categorized as non-performing remain in non-performing status until the payment status is current and an event occurs that fully remediates the impairment or the loan demonstrates a sustained period of performance without a past due event, and there is reasonable assurance as to the collectability of all amounts due. Within the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, the accrual status is generally systematically driven, so that if the customer makes a payment that brings the loan below 90 days past due, the loan automatically returns to accrual status.\nCommercial\nCommercial NPLs decreased $25.0 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, commercial NPLs accounted for 0.5% of total commercial loans, compared to 0.6% of total commercial loans at December 31, 2014. The decrease in commercial NPLs was primarily attributable to a decrease of NPLs in the CRE portfolio of $54.6 million, due to continued improvement in credit quality, and offset by an increase of $30.1 million in the C&I portfolio, due to the energy sector.\nConsumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\nThe following table shows NPLs compared to total loans outstanding for the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Residential mortgages (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Home equity loans and lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Residential mortgages (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Home equity loans and lines of credit\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,467,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,146,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,969,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,206,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPLs as a percentage of total loans\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPLs in foreclosure status\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes LHFS\nThe NPL ratio is significantly higher for the Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio compared to its consumer loans secured by real estate portfolio due to a number of factors, including: the prolonged workout and foreclosure resolution processes for residential mortgage loans; differences in risk profiles; and mortgage loans located outside the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States.\nResolution challenges with low foreclosure sales continue to impact both residential mortgage and consumer loans secured by real estate portfolio NPL balances, but foreclosure inventory decreased quarter-over-quarter. The foreclosure moratorium was lifted and activity resumed in the fourth quarter of 2011, but delays in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts limited the decline in NPL balances and contributed to a higher NPL ratio. As of December 31, 2015, foreclosures in all states except Delaware and Washington, D.C. were moving forward. Both Delaware and Washington, D.C. are delayed due to new legal complexities surrounding documentation required to initiate new foreclosure proceedings.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nA new foreclosure law was enacted in Massachusetts in August 2012, and the Massachusetts Division of Banks issued its final rules on the implementation of the new foreclosure law in June 2013. These final rules require lenders to offer loan modification terms to certain borrowers prior to proceeding with foreclosure, unless the lender is able to prove that the modification would result in greater losses for the bank or that the borrower has rejected the offer. Lenders are also required to send notice to borrowers regarding their right to request a modification. Breach notices for Massachusetts foreclosures recommenced in September 2013.\nThe following table represents the concentration of foreclosures by state as a percentage of total foreclosures at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Jersey\n</td> <td>17.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New York\n</td> <td>27.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pennsylvania\n</td> <td>22.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Massachusetts\n</td> <td>10.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other states\n</td> <td>22.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe foreclosure closings issue has a greater impact on the residential mortgage portfolio than the consumer real estate secured portfolio due to the larger volume of loans in first lien position in that portfolio which have equity upon which to foreclose. Exclusive of Chapter 7 bankruptcy NPL accounts, approximately 83.9% of the 90+ day delinquent loan balances in the residential mortgage portfolio are secured by a first lien, while only 50.7% of the 90+ day delinquent loan balances in the consumer real estate secured portfolio are secured by a first lien. Consumer real estate secured NPLs may get charged off more quickly due to the lack of equity to foreclose from a second lien position. The Alt-A segment consists of loans with limited documentation requirements and a portion of which were originated through independent parties (\"Brokers\") outside the Bank's geographic footprint. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the residential mortgage portfolio included the following Alt-A loans:\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>531,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A loans as a percentage of the residential mortgage portfolio(1)\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A loans in NPL status\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A loans in NPL status as a percentage of residential mortgage NPLs\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes residential mortgage HFS\nThe performance of the Alt-A segment has remained poor, averaging an 8.7% NPL ratio in 2015. Alt-A mortgage originations were discontinued in 2008 and have continued to run off at an average rate of 1.9% per month. Alt-A NPL balances represented 64.6% of the total residential mortgage loan portfolio NPL balance at the end of the first quarter of 2009, when the portfolio was placed in run-off, compared to 26.7% at December 31, 2015. As the Alt-A segment runs off and higher quality residential mortgages are added to the portfolio, the shift in product mix is expected to lower NPL balances.\nConsumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\nRICs and amortizing term personal loans are classified as non-performing when they are greater than 60 days past due with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the fair value option, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to a performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off.\nNPLs in the consumer loans not secured by real estate portfolio increased $140.9 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, non-performing consumer loans not secured by real estate accounted for 3.8% of total consumer loans not secured by real estate, compared to 3.7% of total consumer loans not secured by real estate at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio of $144.7 million. This NPL increase is due to the rise of nonprime loans, as a percentage of the portfolio, which have a higher default rate than prime loans.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (\"TDRs\")\nTDRs are loans that have been modified as the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of the customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferments of principal.\nTDRs are generally placed in nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, TDRs may return to accrual status after demonstrating at least six consecutive months of sustained payments following modification, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. For the RIC portfolio, loans may return to accrual status when the balance is remediated to current status. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status.\nThe following table summarizes TDRs at the dates indicated:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>134,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail installment contracts and auto loan\n</td> <td>3,454,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,697,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>90,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total performing\n</td> <td>3,807,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,041,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>66,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>66,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail installment contracts and auto loan\n</td> <td>422,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>48,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing\n</td> <td>603,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,411,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,385,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerforming TDRs totaled $3.8 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to December 31, 2014.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nCommercial\nPerforming commercial TDRs decreased from $186.7 million, or 71.5% of total commercial TDRs at December 31, 2014 to $128.1 million, or 66.0% of total commercial TDRs at December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to improving credit quality and performance among commercial borrowers in 2015, including payments on TDRs of $114.4 million exceeding new TDRs of $44.2 million.\nResidential Mortgages\nPerforming residential mortgage TDRs increased from $83.6 million, or 54.2% of total residential mortgage TDRs at December 31, 2014 to $134.4 million, or 66.9% of total residential TDRs at December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the Company receiving refreshed chapter 7 bankruptcy data related to the residential mortgage portfolio, which added $41.4 million to the TDR portfolio in 2015.\nRIC\nRICs were a new portfolio for the Company in 2014 as a result of the Change in Control. The RIC and auto loan portfolio is primarily comprised of nonprime loans (69.0% at December 31, 2015) which lead to a higher rate of modifications and deferrals, and thus a higher volume of TDRs, than other portfolios. Total RIC and auto loan portfolio TDRs (performing and non-performing) comprised 8.2% of the Company's total RIC and auto loan portfolio at December 31, 2014 and 15.1% at December 31, 2015. Loan portfolios acquired as part of a business combination like the Change in Control cannot be designated as TDRs under U.S. GAAP at the Change in Control date. As a result, the increase is primarily driven by RICs and auto loans originated prior to the Change in Control date which received their first modification, deferral greater than 90 days or second deferral subsequent to the Change in Control date during the reporting period. As a percentage of the RIC and auto loan portfolio recorded investment, there have been no significant increases in modification or deferral activity during the reporting period. The increased TDR activity at SHUSA may continue until the loan portfolios acquired as part of the Change in Control runoff.\nIn accordance with its policies and guidelines, the Company, at times, offer payment deferrals to borrowers on its retail installment contracts, under which the consumer is allowed to move up to three delinquent payments to the end of the loan. The policies and guidelines limit the number and frequency of deferrals that may be granted to one deferral every six months and eight months over the life of a loan. Additionally, the Company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received. During the deferral period, the Company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement.\nAt the time a deferral is granted, all delinquent amounts may be deferred or paid, resulting in the classification of the loan as current and therefore not considered a delinquent account. Thereafter, the account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account.\nThe Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio.\nChanges in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts for loans classified as TDRs used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and related provision for loan and lease losses. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan and lease losses and related provision for loan and lease losses.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nOther Consumer Loans\nPerforming other consumer loan TDRs increased from $74.7 million, or 59.1% of total other consumer loan TDRs at December 31, 2014 to $90.5 million, or 65.3% of total other consumer loan TDRs at December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio, including new TDRs of $31.8 million exceeding payments and charge-offs of $16.6 million. If a customer's financial difficulty is not temporary, the Company may agree, or be required by a bankruptcy court, to grant a modification involving one or a combination of the following: a reduction in interest rate, a reduction in the loan's principal balance, or an extension of the maturity date. The servicer also may grant concessions on the Company's revolving personal loans in the form of principal or interest rate reductions or payment plans.\nTDR activity in the personal loan and other consumer portfolios was negligible to overall TDR activity.\nDelinquencies\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's delinquencies consisted of the following:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(As Restated)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>Commercial Loans\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate\n</td> <td>Commercial Loans\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Delinquencies\n</td> <td>$390,714\n</td> <td>$3,904,809\n</td> <td>$159,501\n</td> <td>$4,455,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$488,911\n</td> <td>$3,589,648\n</td> <td>$175,459\n</td> <td>$4,254,018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loans(1)\n</td> <td>$12,614,668\n</td> <td>$29,350,173\n</td> <td>$40,709,731\n</td> <td>$82,674,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$13,176,289\n</td> <td>$26,467,316\n</td> <td>$36,640,761\n</td> <td>$76,284,366\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delinquencies as a % of Loans\n</td> <td>3.1%\n</td> <td>13.3%\n</td> <td>0.4%\n</td> <td>5.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7%\n</td> <td>13.6%\n</td> <td>0.5%\n</td> <td>5.6%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes LHFS\nOverall, total delinquencies have increased by $201.0 million or 4.7% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Consumer loans secured by real estate delinquencies have decreased $98.2 million primarily due to improvements in credit quality in the residential mortgage portfolio. Consumer loans not secured by real estate delinquencies have increased $315.2 million primarily due to the increase in nonprime accounts in the RIC and auto loan portfolio. Commercial delinquencies have decreased $16.0 million primarily due to overall improvements in credit quality.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (\"ACL\")\nThe ACL is maintained at levels that management considers adequate to provide for losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. Management's evaluation takes into consideration the risks inherent in the portfolio, past loan and lease loss experience, specific loans with loss potential, geographic and industry concentrations, delinquency trends, the level of originations, credit quality metrics such as Fair Isaac Corporation ( FICO\u201d) and combined loan-to-value ( CLTV\u201d), internal risk ratings, economic conditions and other relevant factors.

The increase in the overall ACL was primarily attributable to SC's personal unsecured loan portfolios being reclassified as held-for-sale, as well as the lower of cost or fair value adjustments on certain RICs and auto loans. This is also the primary driver behind the increase in the ACL attributed to consumer loans. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses allocated to commercial loans was, in part, attributed to additional reserves recorded on the Company's energy portfolio citing current economic conditions impacting this sector.\nManagement regularly monitors the condition of the Company's portfolio, considering factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquencies and NPLs, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, the experience and ability of staff, and regional and national economic conditions and trends.\nThe risk factors inherent in the ACL are continuously reviewed and revised by management when conditions indicate that the estimates initially applied are different from actual results. The Company also performs a comprehensive analysis of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In addition, a review of allowance levels based on nationally published statistics is conducted quarterly.\nThe factors supporting the ACL do not diminish the fact that the entire ACL is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio. The Company's principal focus is to ensure the adequacy of the total ACL.\nThe ACL is subject to review by banking regulators. The Company's primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the ACL and make assessments regarding its adequacy and the methodology employed in its determination.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nCommercial\nFor the commercial loan portfolio excluding small business loans (businesses with annual sales of up to $3.0 million), the Company has specialized credit officers, a monitoring unit, and workout units that identify and manage potential problem loans. Changes in management factors, financial and operating performance, company behavior, industry factors and external events and circumstances are evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine whether potential impairment is evident and additional analysis is needed. For the commercial loan portfolios, risk ratings are assigned to each loan to differentiate risk within the portfolio, reviewed on an ongoing basis by credit risk management and revised, if needed, to reflect the borrower's current risk profile and the related collateral position. The risk ratings consider factors such as financial condition, debt capacity and coverage ratios, market presence and quality of management. Generally, credit officers reassess a borrower's risk rating on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if warranted. This reassessment process is managed by credit officers and is overseen by the Credit Monitoring group to ensure consistency and accuracy in risk ratings, as well as the appropriate frequency of risk rating reviews by the Company's credit officers. The Company's Credit Risk Review Committee assesses whether the Company's Credit Risk Review Framework and, risk management guidelines established by the Company's Board and applicable laws and regulations are being followed, and reports key findings and relevant information to the Board. The Company's Credit Risk Review group regularly performs loan reviews and assesses the appropriateness of assigned risk ratings. When credits are downgraded below a certain level, the Company's Workout Department becomes responsible for managing the credit risk. Risk rating actions are generally reviewed formally by one or more credit committees depending on the size of the loan and the type of risk rating action being taken. Detailed analyses are completed that support the risk rating and management's strategies for the customer relationship going forward.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. An insignificant delay (e.g., less than 90 days) or insignificant shortfall in the amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired. Impaired commercial loans are comprised of all TDRs plus non-accrual loans in excess of $1 million that are not TDRs. In addition, the Company may perform a specific reserve analysis on loans that fail to meet this threshold if the nature of the collateral or business conditions warrant. The Company performs a specific reserve analysis on certain loans regardless of loan size. If a loan is identified as impaired and is collateral-dependent, an initial appraisal is obtained to provide a baseline to determine the property's fair market value. The frequency of appraisals depends on the type of collateral being appraised. If the collateral value is subject to significant volatility (due to location of the asset, obsolescence, etc.), an appraisal is obtained more frequently. At a minimum, updated appraisals for impaired loans are obtained within a 12-month period if the loan remains outstanding for that period of time.\nIf a loan is identified as impaired and is not collateral-dependent, impairment is measured based on a discounted cash flow methodology.\nWhen the Company determines that the value of an impaired loan is less than its carrying amount, the Company recognizes impairment through a provision estimate or a charge-off to the allowance. Management performs these assessments on at least a quarterly basis. For commercial loans, a charge-off is recorded when a loan, or a portion thereof, is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance on the Company's books as an asset is not warranted. Charge-offs are recorded on a monthly basis, and partially charged-off loans continue to be evaluated on at least a quarterly basis, with additional charge-offs or loan and lease loss provisions taken on the remaining loan balance, if warranted, utilizing the same criteria.\nThe portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses related to the commercial portfolio was $433.5 million at December 31, 2015 (1.1% of commercial loans held for investment)and $386.8 million at December 31, 2014 (1.1% of commercial loans held for investment). The primary factor resulting in the consistency of the allowance for loan and lease losses coverage is the result of continued improvement of credit quality in the portfolio, as evidenced by the decrease in delinquencies, non-accruals, and TDRs. The ACL allocated to the commercial portfolio increased, in part, due to current economic environment impacting our commercial customers in the energy sector. Management recorded additional reserves in relation to this portfolio during 2015.\nConsumer\nThe consumer loan and small business loan portfolios are monitored for credit risk and deterioration with statistical tools considering factors such as delinquency LTV ratios, and internal and external credit scores. Management evaluates the consumer portfolios throughout their life cycles on a portfolio basis. When problem loans are identified that are secured with collateral, management examines the loan files to evaluate the nature and type of collateral. Management documents the collateral type, the date of the most recent valuation, and whether any liens exist to determine the value to compare against the committed loan amount.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nResidential mortgages not adequately secured by collateral are generally charged-off when deemed to be uncollectible or are delinquent 180 days or more, whichever comes first, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that repayment will occur regardless of the delinquency status. Examples that would demonstrate repayment likelihood include: a loan that is secured by collateral and is in the process of collection; a loan supported by a valid guarantee or insurance; or a loan supported by a valid claim against a solvent estate.\nFor residential mortgage loans, loss severity assumptions are incorporated into the loan and lease loss reserve models to estimate loan balances that will ultimately charge-off. These assumptions are based on recent loss experience within various CLTV bands in these portfolios. CLTVs are refreshed quarterly by applying Federal Housing Finance Agency Home Price Index changes at a state-by-state level to the last known appraised value of the property to estimate the current CLTV. The Company's allowance for loan and lease losses incorporates the refreshed CLTV information to update the distribution of defaulted loans by CLTV as well as the associated loss given default for each CLTV band. Reappraisals at the individual property level are not considered cost-effective or necessary on a recurring basis; however, reappraisals are performed on certain higher risk accounts to support line management activities and default servicing decisions, or when other situations arise for which the Company believes the additional expense is warranted. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $561.8 million and $5.4 billion of consumer home equity loans and lines of credit, which included $240.6 million and $2.9 billion, or 42.8% and 53.0%, in junior lien positions, respectively. Loss severity rates on these consumer home equity loans and lines of credit in junior lien positions were 57.0% and 69.4%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.\nA home equity loan or line of credit not adequately secured by collateral is treated similarly to how residential mortgages are treated. A home equity loan or line of credit also incorporate loss severity assumptions into the loan and lease loss reserve model following the same methodology as residential mortgage loans. To ensure the Company has captured losses inherent in its home equity portfolios, the Company estimates its allowance for loan and lease losses for home equity loans and lines of credit by segmenting its portfolio into sub-segments based on the nature of the portfolio and certain risk characteristics such as product type, lien positions, and origination channels. Projected future defaulted loan balances are estimated within each portfolio sub-segment by incorporating risk parameters, including the current payment status as well as historical trends in delinquency rates. Other assumptions, including prepayment and attrition rates, are also calculated at the portfolio sub-segment level and incorporated into the estimation of the likely volume of defaulted loan balances. The projected default volume is stratified across CLTV ratio bands, and a loss severity rate for each CLTV band is applied based on the Company's historical net credit loss experience. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market, or industry conditions, or changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral.\nThe Company considers the delinquency status of its senior liens in cases in which the Company services the lien. The Company currently services the senior lien on 24.7% of junior lien home equity principal balances. Of the junior lien home equity loan and line of credit balances that are current, 0.8% have a senior lien that is one or more payments past due. When the senior lien is delinquent but the junior lien is current, allowance levels are adjusted to reflect loss estimates consistent with the delinquency status of the senior lien. The Company also extrapolates these impacts to the junior lien portfolio when the senior lien is serviced by another investor and the delinquency status of that senior lien is unknown.\nDepository and lending institutions in the U.S. generally are expected to experience a significant volume of home equity lines of credit that will be approaching the end of their draw periods over the next several years, following the growth in home equity lending experienced during 2003 through 2007. As a result, many of these home equity lines of credit will either convert to amortizing loans or have principal due as balloon payments. The percentage of the Company's current home equity lines of credit that are expected to reach the end of their draw periods prior to January 1, 2019 is approximately 2.7% and not considered significant. The Company's home equity lines of credit originated prior to 2007 are generally open-ended, revolving loans with fixed-rate lock options and draw periods of up to 15 years, along with amortizing repayment periods of up to 15 years. The Company's home equity lines of credit generated after 2007 are generally open-ended, revolving loans with fixed-rate lock options and draw periods of up to 10 years, along with amortizing repayment periods of up to 20 years. The Company currently monitors delinquency rates for amortizing and non-amortizing lines, as well as other credit quality metrics including FICO credit scoring model score and LTV ratio. The Company's home equity lines of credit are generally underwritten considering fully drawn and fully amortizing levels. As a result, the Company currently does not anticipate a significant deterioration in credit quality when these home equity lines of credit begin to amortize.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nFor RIC and personal unsecured loans at SC, the Company estimates the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. RICs and personal unsecured loans are considered separately in assessing the required allowance for loan and lease losses using product-specific allowance methodologies applied on pooled basis. For RICs, the Company segregates the portfolio based on homogeneity into pools based on source, then further stratifies each pool by vintage and custom loss forecasting score. For each vintage and risk segment, the Company's vintage model predicts timing of unit losses and the loan balances at time of default. Auto loans are charged off when an account becomes 120 days delinquent if the Company has not repossessed the vehicle. The Company writes the vehicle down to the estimated recovery amount of the collateral when the automobile is repossessed and legally available for disposition.\nThe Company considers changes in the used vehicle index when forecasting recovery rates to apply to the gross losses forecasted by the vintage model. Its models do not include other macro-economic factors. Instead, the allowance for loan and lease loss process considers factors such as unemployment rates and bankruptcy trends as potential qualitative overlays. Management reviews idiosyncratic and systemic risks facing the business. This qualitative overlay framework enables the allowance for loan and lease loss process to arrive at a provision that reflects all relevant information, including both quantitative model outputs and qualitative overlays.\nFor the personal unsecured loan portfolio at SC, as of December 31, 2015, there was no allowance associated with the portfolio as the portfolio was transferred to held for sale in the third quarter of 2015. In previous periods, including December 31, 2014, the Company employed product specific models in determining the required allowance for loan and lease losses. For the fixed rate installment loan portfolio, a vintage modeling approach was employed in which the models predicted the timing of losses and the loan balance at the time of default. As these were unsecured loans, the total loss was the loan balance at the time of default. For revolving loans, the model stratified the portfolio based on delinquency categories and age of account. Loss rates were derived from historical experience to determine the expected portfolio losses over the next 12 months.\nThe allowance for consumer loans was $2.7 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The allowance as a percentage of held for investment consumer loans was 7.0% at December 31, 2015 and 3.4% at December 31, 2014. The increase in the allowance for consumer loans is primarily attributable to SC's personal unsecured loan portfolios being reclassified as held-for-sale, as well as the lower of cost or fair value adjustments on certain RICs and auto loans, which were reflected as charge-offs of $451.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, SC determined that it no longer intended to hold its personal unsecured lending assets for investment. As a result, approximately $1.9 billion of personal unsecured loans were transferred to held-for-sale, net of a lower of cost or fair value adjustment of $377.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the lower of cost or fair value adjustments associated with RIC and auto loan sales was $73.4 million.\nWhen adjusting for these lower of cost or fair value adjustments, SC's consumer loan net charge-off rate did not change materially year-over-year. Future loan originations and purchases under SC's personal lending platform will also be classified as held-for-sale. Future lower of cost or fair value adjustments could impact the reported charge-off ratio; otherwise, the Company does not expect significant movements in its charge-off ratios.\nThe Company's allowance models and reserve levels are back-tested on a quarterly basis to ensure that both remain within appropriate ranges. As a result, management believes that the current allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb inherent losses in the consumer portfolios.\nUnallocated\nAdditionally, the Company reserves for certain inherent, but undetected, losses that are probable within the loan and lease portfolios. This is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models or to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the Company's entire loan and lease portfolios. These imprecisions may include loss factors inherent in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance, as well as potential variability in estimates. Period-to-period changes in the Company's historical unallocated allowance for loan and lease loss positions are considered in light of these factors. The unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses was $45.3 million at December 31, 2015 and $33.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Company estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments consists of two elements: (i) an allocated reserve, which is determined by an analysis of historical loss experience and risk factors, current economic conditions, performance trends within specific portfolio segments, and any other pertinent information, and (ii) an unallocated reserve to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Additions to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are made by charges to the provision for credit losses, and this reserve is classified within Other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Once an unfunded lending commitment becomes funded and is carried as a loan, the corresponding reserves are transferred to the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nThe reserve for unfunded lending commitments increased from $132.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $147.4 million at December 31, 2015. This increase was due to an increase in off-balance sheet lending commitments, which is a result of the overall increase in the Company's commercial lending business. As a result of these shifts, the net impact of the decrease in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to the overall ACL is immaterial.\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES\nInvestment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasuries, MBS, tax-free municipal securities, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities (\"ABS\") and stock in the FHLB and the FRB. MBS consist of pass-through, collateralized mortgage obligations, and adjustable rate mortgages issued by federal agencies. The Company's MBS are either guaranteed as to principal and interest by the issuer or have ratings of AAA\u201d by S&P and Moody's at the date of issuance. The Company's available-for-sale investment strategy is to purchase liquid fixed-rate and floating-rate investments to manage the Company's liquidity position and interest rate risk adequately.\nTotal investment securities available-for-sale increased $5.0 billion to $20.9 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $15.9 billion at December 31, 2014. During 2015, the composition of the Company's investment portfolio changed by decreases in ABS, corporate, and municipal securities which were offset by increases in High Quality Liquid Assets (\"HQLA\") such as U.S. Treasuries and MBS. HQLA are low risk assets that can easily and immediately be converted into cash at little or no loss of value such as cash or investment securities guaranteed by a sovereign entity. This increase was primarily driven by activity within the MBS portfolio, offset by activity within the state and municipal portfolio. MBS increased by $6.2 billion primarily due to $8.3 billion of investment purchases, offset by sales and maturities of $0.7 billion and normal principal amortization during 2015. The state and municipal portfolio decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to sales and maturities of $1.0 billion. During 2015, the Company began implementing a strategy to improve the Company's liquidity by selling non-high-quality liquid assets and reinvesting the funds into HQLA. For additional information with respect to the Company's investment securities, see Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal gross unrealized losses increased $33.2 million during 2015, primarily due to increases in interest rates. The majority of the increases in unrealized losses during the year were in the MBS portfolios and U.S. Treasury securities. The unrealized losses within the MBS portfolios increased by $28.1 million, and the unrealized losses within the U.S. Treasury securities increased by $5.6 million. Refer to Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nThere were no trading securities held at December 31, 2015, compared to $833.9 million at December 31, 2014.\nOther investments, which consists of FHLB stock and FRB stock, increased from $817.0 million at December 31, 2014 to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2015 primarily due to purchases of FHLB and FRB stock, partially offset by the FHLB's repurchase of its stock and adoption of ASU 2014-01 which resulted in the re-classification of $26.4 million in LIHTC investments into Other investments.\nThe average life of the available-for-sale investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at December 31, 2015 was approximately 3.94 years, compared to 4.11 years at December 31, 2014. The average effective duration of the investment portfolio (excluding certain ABS) at December 31, 2015 was approximately 2.95 years.

Consistent with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize goodwill and reviews the goodwill recorded for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2015, goodwill totaled $4.4 billion and represented 3.5% of total assets and 22.7% of total stockholder's equity. The following table shows goodwill by reportable segments at December 31, 2015:\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail Banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Auto Finance & Business Banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Real Estate and Commercial Banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Global Corporate Banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,550,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$445,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,297,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$131,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,019,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4,444,389\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the Company determined that the expiration of the direct lease origination agreement with SC constituted a potential impairment indicator in the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit. As a result, the Company conducted a Step 1 interim impairment test on the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit as of April 1, 2015. The Company conducted the interim impairment test in the same manner as its annual impairment test with key inputs and assumptions being updated as of the interim testing date. The results of the interim impairment test validated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit by over 25%. Based on these results, the Company did not consider the goodwill assigned to the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nAs of October 1, 2015, the Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test using the generally accepted valuation methods discussed in the Company's Critical Accounting Policies section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. After conducting a fair valuation analysis of each reporting unit as of the annual testing date, the Company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill identified as a result of the annual impairment analysis.\nFor the Retail Banking reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market approach (\"market approach\") and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. The projected tangible book value (TBV) of 1.5x was selected based on publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 9.5% which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 4.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Retail Banking reporting unit by 21.3%, indicating the Retail Banking reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.5x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 12.9% which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 4.0%were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit by 34.2%, indicating the Auto Finance & Business Banking reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the Commercial Real Estate reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.5x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 10.7% which is most representative of the business' cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates 3.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Commercial Real Estate reporting unit by 33.1% indicating the Commercial Real Estate reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the Corporate and Commercial Banking reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.5x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate 11.0% which is most representative of the business' cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 4.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the Corporate and Commercial Banking reporting unit by 45.3%, indicating the Corporate and Commercial Banking reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nFor the GCB reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market and income approach was applied. For the market approach, the Company selected a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. The projected TBV of 1.4x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit and was equally considered with the projected earnings multiples of 10.0x, 9.0x, and 8.0x which were applied to the reporting unit's 2015, 2016 and 2017 earnings. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 11.6% which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 4.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the GCB reporting unit by 94.9%, indicating the GCB reporting unit was not considered to be impaired or at risk for impairment.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nFor the SC reporting unit's fair valuation analysis, an equal weighting of the market approach, the market capitalization approach and the income approach was applied. For the market capitalization approach, SC's stock price from October 1, 2015 of $21.80 was used and a 35.0% control premium was used based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable. For the market approach, the projected TBV of 1.8x was selected based on the selected publicly traded peers of the reporting unit and was equally considered with the projected earnings multiple of 8.3x which was applied to reporting unit's 2015 earnings. For the income approach, the Company selected a discount rate of 9.9% which is most representative of the reporting unit's cost of equity at the time of the analysis. Long-term growth rates of 3.0% were applied in determining the terminal value. The results of the equally weighted fair value analyses exceeded the carrying value for the SC reporting unit by 11.7%, indicating the SC reporting unit was not considered to be impaired. By the time the annual impairment analysis was finalized, the share price of SC had declined from the $21.80 used in the annual impairment analysis. The Company continued to evaluate the decline of the stock price from the time the annual impairment test was complete through the end of the fourth quarter.\nAt December 31, 2015, given the decline in SC's stock price between the 2015 annual goodwill impairment analysis and year-end, the Company concluded that the fair value of the SC reporting unit was more likely than not less than its carrying value including goodwill. As a result, the Company conducted an interim impairment analysis for possible goodwill impairment of the SC reporting unit's goodwill as of December 31, 2015. For the Step 1 analysis, the Company utilized the market capitalization approach to determine the fair valuation of the reporting unit. The Company used SC's stock price of $15.85, which was the stock's price as of interim testing date. The Company utilized a 35.0% control premium based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the market place that was determined to be comparable.\nBased on the Company's interim Step 1 analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the SC reporting unit's goodwill exceeded the fair value. As a result, the Company moved onto a Step 2 analysis. For Step 2, the Company compared the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that is recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in Step 1 over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired. Considerable judgment is involved in the determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and as such, directly impact the fair value of the reporting unit calculation which is part of the Step 2 analysis. The most significant estimates related to the fair valuation of the loans and intangible assets.\nBased on the Company's interim Step 1 and Step 2 analyses, the Company concluded that goodwill related to the SC reporting unit was impaired at December 31, 2015. The Company recorded an impairment of goodwill of $4.4 billion. At December 31, 2015 the Company has $1.0 billion of goodwill allocated to the SC reporting unit. Also, as a result of the Company's interim Step 1 and Step 2 analyses, the Company concluded an indefinite-lived intangible asset trade name was impaired. As a result, the Company booked an impairment of $11.7 million. At the time the interim impairment test was complete, the share price of SC had declined from $15.85 used in the interim impairment analysis. The Company is currently evaluating the goodwill of the SC reporting unit for potential impairment for the first quarter of 2016.\nPREMISES AND EQUIPMENT\nTotal premises and equipment, net, was $942.4 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $854.7 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in total premises and equipment was primarily due to computer software implementations, purchases of furniture, office equipment and ATMs as well as leasehold improvements in both corporate and retail. In 2014, certain changes to the Company's IT strategy resulted in the Company conducting an assessment of its capitalized costs related to internally developed software classified as held and used. As part of that assessment, the Company identified a number of assets it determined to have no future service potential as well as assets whose carrying values were not considered recoverable in accordance with applicable accounting standards. This assessment resulted in the Company recording an impairment charge of $97.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 7 for details on premises and equipment.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nDEFERRED TAXES AND OTHER TAX ACTIVITY\nThe Company's net deferred tax balance was a liability of $0.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014. The $842.8 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $982.9 million decrease in the deferred tax liability related to the Company's investment in SC as a result of the goodwill impairment, partially offset by a $580.2 million increase in the deferred tax liability related to accelerated tax deprecation on leasing transactions. Other activity driving the reduction in the deferred tax liability included a $293.6 million increase in deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, a $167.5 million decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to purchase accounting adjustments for SC, and a net $21.0 million increase in the net deferred tax asset from other temporary differences.\nThe Company has a lawsuit pending against the United States in Federal District Court in Massachusetts relating to the proper tax consequences of two financing transactions with an international bank through which the Company borrowed $1.2 billion. As a result of these financing transactions, the Company paid foreign taxes of $264.0 million during the years 2003 through 2007 and claimed a corresponding foreign tax credit for foreign taxes paid during those years, which the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") disallowed. The IRS also disallowed the Company's deductions for interest expense and transaction costs, totaling $74.6 million in tax liability, and assessed penalties and interest totaling approximately $92.5 million. The Company has paid the taxes, penalties and interest associated with the IRS adjustments for all tax years, and the lawsuit will determine whether the Company is entitled to a refund of the amounts paid. The Company has recorded a receivable in the Other assets line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the amount of these payments, less a tax reserve of $230.1 million, as of December 31, 2015.\nOn November 13, 2015, the Federal District Court issued a written opinion in favor of the Company on all contested issues, and in a judgment issued on January 13, 2016, ordered amounts assessed by the IRS for years 2003 through 2005 to be refunded to the Company. On March 11, 2016, the IRS filed a notice of appeal. The appeal will be heard in the First Circuit.\nIn 2013, two different federal courts decided cases involving similar financing structures entered into by the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (\"BNY Mellon\") and BB&T Corp. (\"BB&T\") in favor of the IRS. BNY Mellon and BB&T each appealed. On May 14, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided BB&T's appeal by affirming the trial court's decision to disallow BB&T's foreign tax credits and to allow penalties, but reversing the trial court and allowed BB&T's entitlement to interest deductions. On September 9, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the trial court's decision in BNY Mellon's case, allowing BNY Mellon to claim interest deductions, but disallowing BNY Mellon's claimed foreign tax credits. On September 29, 2015, BB&T filed a petition requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its appeal of the Federal Circuit Court's decision. BNY Mellon filed a petition requesting the U.S. Supreme Court hear its appeal of the Second Circuit's decision on November 3, 2015. On March 7, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied BB&T's and BNY Mellon's petitions.\nWhile the Company remains confident in the legal merits of its position, the Company increased its reserve position as of December 31, 2015 by $104.2 million, and believes its reserve amount adequately provides for potential exposure to the IRS related to these items. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions could range from a decrease of $230.1 million to an increase of $201.9 million.\nOTHER ASSETS\nOther assets at December 31, 2015 were $1.8 billion, compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease in other assets was primarily due to activity in income tax receivables and miscellaneous assets and receivables, offset by an increase in other repossessed assets.\nIncome tax receivables decreased $328.5 million, primarily due to the decrease in accrued federal tax receivables.\nMiscellaneous assets and receivables decreased $730.8 million primarily due to investment trades unsettled at the end of 2014 that cleared subsequent to December 31, 2014. These unsettled trades were primarily related to $580.7 million in sales of trading securities liquidated in the first quarter of 2015.\nThe decreases above were offset by an increase in other repossessed assets of $67.3 million between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of the auto portfolio, maturities associated with the lease portfolio and the reclassification during 2015 of $31.7M of vehicle inventory previously included within miscellaneous other assets to other repossessed assets.\nSANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nDEPOSITS AND OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS\nThe Bank attracts deposits within its primary market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments, including demand and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, customer repurchase agreements, such as certificates of deposit (\"CDs\") and retirement savings plans. The Bank also issues wholesale deposit products such as brokered deposits and government deposits on a periodic basis, which serve as an additional source of liquidity for the Company.\n \nTotal deposits and other customer accounts increased $3.6 billion from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The increase in deposits was primarily due to increases in money market accounts, CDs and noninterest-bearing accounts, offset by a decrease in interest-bearing accounts. The increase in deposits was primarily comprised of increases in money market accounts of $2.8 billion, or 13.1% and CDs of $1.2 billion, or 16.4% due mainly to continuing better economic conditions encouraging movement from certain interest-bearing investments to money market accounts and CDs.\nInterest-bearing deposit accounts decreased $610.4 million, or 5.6%, primarily due to the shift in deposits to money market accounts. The Company continues to focus its efforts on attracting and increasing lower-cost deposits, however, the cost of deposits increased from 0.49% for the fourth quarter of 2014 to 0.60% for the fourth quarter of 2015.\nDemand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were $25.2 million and $51.3 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Time deposits of $250,000 or more totaled $1.5 billion and $993.4 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nBORROWINGS AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company has term loans and lines of credit with Santander and other third-party lenders. The Bank utilizes borrowings and other debt obligations as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset/liability management. Collateralized advances are available from the FHLB if certain standards related to creditworthiness are met. The Bank also utilizes repurchase agreements, which are short-term obligations collateralized by securities. In addition, SC has warehouse lines of credit and securitizes some of its retail installment contracts and operating leases, which are structured secured financings. Total borrowings and other debt obligations at December 31, 2015 were $49.1 billion, compared to $39.7 billion at December 31, 2014. Total borrowings increased $9.4 billion, primarily due to $3.1 billion of new debt issued by the Bank and the Holding Company, an increase of $4.4 billion in FHLB Advances, and net $2.5 billion of SC securitization activity, offset by maturing debt of $0.6 billion.
