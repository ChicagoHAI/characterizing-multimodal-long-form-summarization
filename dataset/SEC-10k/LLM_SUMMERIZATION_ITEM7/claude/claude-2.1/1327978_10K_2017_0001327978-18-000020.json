MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nBlack Creek Diversified Property Fund Inc. is a NAV-based perpetual life REIT that was formed on April 11, 2005, as a Maryland corporation. We are primarily focused on investing in and operating a diverse portfolio of real property. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and managed a real estate portfolio that included 48 properties totaling approximately 7.6 million square feet located in 19 markets throughout the U.S., with 471 tenants.\nWe have operated and elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2006, and we intend to continue to operate in accordance with the requirements for qualification as a REIT. We utilize an UPREIT organizational structure to hold all or substantially all of our assets through the Operating Partnership.\nAs a NAV-based perpetual life REIT, we intend to conduct ongoing public primary offerings of our common stock on a perpetual basis. We also intend to conduct an ongoing distribution reinvestment plan offering for our stockholders to reinvest distributions in our shares. From time to time, we intend to file new registration statements on Form S-11 with the SEC to register additional shares of common stock so that we may continuously offer shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In 2017, we raised $19.9 million from the sale of common stock in our ongoing public primary offering and $23.3 million from the sale of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information about our public offerings. Whenever we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates prior to the Restructuring Date, we are referring to our shares under our prior share structure, and whenever we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates on or after the Restructuring Date, we are referring to our shares under our new share structure.\nWe currently operate in three reportable segments: retail, office and industrial. The following table summarizes our real estate portfolio by segment as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ and square feet in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Markets (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rentable\nSquare Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aggregate\nFair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,148,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,065,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Reflects the number of unique markets by segment and in total. As such, the total number of markets does not equal the sum of the number of markets by segment as certain segments are located in the same market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We will continue to focus our investment activities on expanding a high-quality, diversified real estate portfolio throughout the U.S. Although we generally target investments in four primary property categories (office, retail, industrial and multifamily), our charter and bylaws do not preclude us from investing in other types of commercial property, real estate debt, or real estate-related equity securities. Our near-term, investment strategy is likely to prioritize new investments in the industrial and multifamily sectors due to attractive fundamental conditions. We have been focused on selling certain non-strategic office and retail assets. The disposition of these properties has helped us to increase our current allocation to industrial real estate assets and liquidity to pursue new investment opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this investment strategy, including with respect to any particular asset class. To a lesser extent we may invest in other types of real\nestate including, but not limited to, hospitality, medical offices, student housing and unimproved land. We currently do not intend in investing in these other types of real estate.\nReal Estate Outlook\nOverall, the U.S. economic environment has continued to improve and remains fundamentally sound. Gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) in the U.S. has continued to grow, and the U.S. unemployment rate is at a relatively low rate. Domestic wage growth has begun to increase, consumer confidence remains high, and tax reform is anticipated to boost corporate profits and reinvestment.\nWhile the U.S. commercial real estate market saw a decline in transaction volume and a slowing of price increases, low vacancy rates and rents continued to outpace inflation resulting in continued net operating income growth.\nThe capital markets outlook for commercial real estate is less clear. While still strong, property fundamentals are slowing and coupled with anticipated Fed tightening and increasing interest rates, price appreciation is moderating at this stage of the cycle. However, investment demand for the asset class remains high, bolstered by an abundance of domestic and foreign capital seeking increased allocations to the sector. With recent increases for inflation expectations, long-term return expectations may improve in the near term. Overall, while there seems to be more runway for real estate fundamentals to improve, there are uncertainties as to how real estate investors will price real estate investments in a rising interest rate environment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSummary of 2017 Activities\nDuring 2017, we completed the following activities:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We acquired two properties comprising 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $40.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We sold 10 properties aggregating 1.8 million square feet for net proceeds of $269.1 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We redeemed or repurchased 23.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted-average purchase price of $7.48 per share for an aggregate amount of $178.4 million.

We evaluate the performance of consolidated operating properties we own and manage using a same store analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of any material changes in the composition of the aggregate portfolio on performance measures. We have defined the same store portfolio to include consolidated operating properties owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods for which the operations had been stabilized. Other operating properties not meeting the same store criteria are reflected in the non-same store portfolio. The same store operating portfolio for the periods presented below include 45 properties totaling approximately 7.1 million square feet owned as of January 1, 2016, which portfolio represented 94.4% of total rentable square feet as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Rental revenues are comprised of base rent, straight-line rent, amortization of above- and below-market lease assets and liabilities, and tenant reimbursement revenue. Total rental revenues decreased by $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in our same store rental revenues as a result of: (i) a 6.2% decrease in average percentage leased, (ii) a $1.61 decrease in average annualized base rent per square foot and (iii) our Sybase Inc. ( Sybase\u201d) and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ( Schwab\u201d) lease expirations in January 2017 and September 2017, respectively. Average percentage leased and average annualized base rent per square foot for our same store portfolio decreased from 95.7% and $20.44, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 89.5% and $22.05, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. These decreases were primarily driven by the Sybase and Schwab lease expirations, which comprised approximately $12.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of our same store rental revenue decrease. Excluding the impact of the Sybase and Schwab lease expirations, same store rental revenues decreased approximately $0.8 million, or 0.5%, for the periods under comparison.\nThe remaining total rental revenue decrease is attributable to our non-same store portfolio, as we had significant net disposition activity during 2017, partially offset by an acquisition during 2016. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information concerning our real property dispositions and acquisition.\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated rental revenues: Table 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(246.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of above- and below-market intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant recovery income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues related to early lease terminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,709\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental Expenses. Rental expenses include certain property operating expenses typically reimbursed by our tenants, such as real estate taxes, property insurance, property management fees, repair and maintenance, and include certain non-recoverable expenses, such as consulting services and roof repairs. Total rental expenses increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in rental expenses in our same store portfolio. The Sybase lease expiration in January 2017 led to a $2.6 million increase in rental expenses, as certain rental expenses associated with the Sybase lease are no longer managed and paid directly by the tenant. Excluding the impact of the Sybase lease expiration, same store rental expenses decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 0.1%, to approximately $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $46.9 million for the same period in 2016.\nThe increase in same store rental expenses was partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in our non-same store rental expenses that was primarily attributable to our real property dispositions during 2017.

Total rental revenues decreased by $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to a decrease in our non-same store rental revenues. The decrease in our non-same store rental revenues was primarily due to the disposition of seven properties during 2016, which were partially offset by the acquisition eight properties during 2015. There was a slight decrease in our same store rental revenues that was driven by an increase in same store straight-line rent adjustments due to rent increases and the expiration of rental concessions, lease termination payments received during 2015, and a decrease in recoverable revenue due to a decrease in snow removal costs incurred by our properties in the Greater Boston market due to an unusually harsh winter in 2015. The decrease in same store rental revenues was partially offset by an increase in average percentage leased and average annualized base rent per square foot for our same store portfolio increased from 95.8% and $22.54, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 96.0% and $23.06, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated rental revenues: Table 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,743\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(976\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(287\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of above- and below-market intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant recovery income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues related to early lease terminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental Expenses.

We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because NOI reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties, such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, advisory fees, acquisition expenses, impairment charges, interest expense, gains on sale of properties, other income and expense, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt and noncontrolling interests. However, NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes such items, which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI. Therefore, we believe net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a reconciliation of our GAAP net loss to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nFunds From Operations ( FFO\u201d)\nWe believe that FFO, in addition to net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are useful supplemental performance measures that our management uses to evaluate our consolidated operating performance. However, this supplemental, non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our performance and is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. No single measure can provide users of financial information with sufficient information and only our disclosures read as a whole can be relied upon to adequately portray our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. In addition, other REITs may define FFO and similar measures differently and choose to treat acquisition-related costs and potentially other accounting line items in a manner different from us due to specific differences in investment and operating strategy or for other reasons.\nFFO. As defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), FFO is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization. We believe FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance that is useful to investors because depreciation and amortization in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. By excluding gains or losses on the sale of assets, we believe FFO provides a helpful additional measure of our consolidated operating performance on a comparative basis. We use FFO as an indication of our consolidated operating performance and as a guide to making decisions about future investments.\nThe following unaudited table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net income to NAREIT FFO:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income per common share-basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of GAAP net income to NAREIT FFO:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate-related depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of real estate property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests' share of net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests' share of NAREIT FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,090\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,509\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO attributable to OP Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding-basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding-diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO per common share-basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in NAREIT FFO per common share was primarily due to the expiration of the Sybase and Schwab leases in January 2017 and September 2017, respectively. See Results of Operations\u201d above for further detail.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of capital for meeting our cash requirements include debt financings, cash generated from operating activities, net proceeds from our public offerings, and asset sales. Our principal uses of funds are distributions to our stockholders, payments under our debt obligations, redemption payments, acquisition of properties and other investments, and capital expenditures. Over time, we intend to fund a majority of our cash needs, including the repayment of debt and capital expenditures, from operating cash flows and refinancings. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $277.4 million of borrowings maturing in the next 12 months. Of this amount, we have extended our $275.0 million term loan to January 2019, with another one year extension option. We expect to be able to repay our principal obligations over the next 12 months from operating cash flows and through refinancings, as well as satisfy the certain conditions regarding any future extension options.\nThe Advisor, subject to the oversight of our board of directors and, under certain circumstances, the investment committee or other committees established by our board of directors, will evaluate potential acquisitions and will engage in negotiations with sellers and lenders on our behalf. Pending investment in property, debt, or other investments, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from our public offerings in certain investments that are expected to yield lower returns than those earned on real estate assets. These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of assets, and undistributed funds from operations.\nWe believe that our cash on-hand, anticipated net offering proceeds, proceeds from our line of credit, and other financing and disposition activities should be sufficient to meet our anticipated future acquisition, operating, debt service and distribution and redemption requirements.\nCash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the following periods:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(172,762\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(214,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(178,643\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Cash Flows Compared to 2016 Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net operating income, components of which are discussed previously within Rental Revenues\u201d and Rental Expenses\u201d under Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\u201d.\nNet cash provided by investing activities decreased by approximately $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in cash received from real property dispositions and (ii) a decrease in restricted cash caused by a mortgage note repayment during 2016 that resulted in receipt of escrow restricted to specific capital expenditures, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for real property acquisitions.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to (i) an increase in mortgage note proceeds, (ii) a decrease in mortgage note repayments and (iii) a decrease in cash paid to redeem common stock, which were partially offset by (i) net repayments on our line of credit, (ii) net proceeds from our term loans during 2016, which had no activity during 2017, and (iii) a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\n2016 Cash Flows Compared to 2015 Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to (i) due to a decline in our net operating income, driven by the disposition of a portfolio of 12 office and industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, (ii) unfavorable changes in other assets and liabilities due to annual property tax payments and (iii) a decrease in interest payments received from our debt-related investments, partially offset by (i) a decrease in asset management fees primarily resulting from the common stock redemptions pursuant to our self-tender offers during 2015 and 2016 and (ii) a decrease in interest payments on borrowings.\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased approximately $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash paid to acquire operating properties partially offset by (i) a decrease in proceeds from disposition of real properties, and (ii) a decrease in principal collections on debt-related investments.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased approximately $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the repayment of nine mortgage note borrowings with an aggregate balance of approximately $326.2 million in 2016, partially offset by (i) a decrease in cash paid for redemption of common shares, (ii) an increase in cash received from the sale of our common shares and (ii) a decrease in distributions paid.\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents balances available, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:\nLine of Credit and Term Loans. As of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of $875.0 million of commitments under our credit agreements, including $400.0 million under our line of credit and $475.0 million under our two term loans. As of that date, we had: (i) approximately $142.0 million outstanding under our line of credit with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.27%; and (ii) $475.0 million outstanding under our term loans with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.54%, which includes the effect of the interest rate swap agreements related to $350.0 million in borrowings under our term loans. The unused and available portions under our line of credit were $258.0 million and $145.8 million, respectively. Our $400.0 million line of credit matures in January 2020, and may be extended pursuant to a one-year extension option, subject to\ncertain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. Our $275.0 million term loan matures in January 2019 and our $200.0 million term loan matures in February 2022. In January 2018, we exercised the first of two one-year extension options for our $275.0 million term loan and extended the maturity date to January 2019. Our line of credit and term loan borrowings are available for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to the refinancing of other debt, payment of redemptions, acquisition and operation of permitted investments. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our line of credit and term loans.\nMortgage Notes. As of December 31, 2017, we had property-level borrowings of approximately $401.9 million outstanding with a weighted-average remaining term of approximately 4.2 years. These borrowings are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust and related assignments and security interests in the collateralized properties, and had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.89%, which includes the effects of the interest rate swap agreement relating to our $33.0 million variable-rate mortgage note. The proceeds from our mortgage notes were used to partially finance certain of our acquisitions. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding the mortgage notes.\nDebt Covenants. Our line of credit, term loan and mortgage note agreements contain various property level covenants, including customary affirmative and negative covenants. In addition, our line of credit and term loan agreements contain certain corporate level financial covenants, including leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, and tangible net worth thresholds. These covenants may limit our ability to incur additional debt, to make borrowings under our line of credit, or to pay distributions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nOffering Proceeds. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of aggregate gross proceeds raised from our current public offerings (including shares issued pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan) was $172.0 million ($156.7 million net of direct selling costs).\nDistributions. To obtain the favorable tax treatment accorded to REITs, we normally will be required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for distributions paid and by excluding net capital gains. The payment of distributions is determined by our board of directors and may be adjusted at its discretion at any time. Distribution levels are set by our board of directors at a level it believes to be appropriate and sustainable based upon a review of a variety of factors including the current and anticipated market conditions, current and anticipated future performance and make-up of our investments, our overall financial projections and expected future cash needs. We intend to continue to make distributions on a quarterly basis.\nThe following table outlines sources used, as determined on a GAAP basis, to pay total gross distributions (which are paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock through our distribution reinvestment plan) for the periods indicated below:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The guidance specifically excludes revenue derived from lease contracts from its scope. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The effective date for the standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2018. Rental revenues and certain tenant reimbursement revenue earned from leasing our operating properties will be evaluated with the adoption of the lease accounting standard (as discussed below). The revised lease accounting standard includes a package of practical expedients that allows an entity to avoid reassessing the accounting for lease components, including the allocations between lease and nonlease components in contracts restated under ASU 2014-09. We expect to elect this package of practical expedients, and accordingly will not reallocate contract consideration to lease components within the scope of the existing lease guidance when we adopt ASU 2014-09. Based on our analysis, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Subtopic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which provides guidance for greater transparency in financial reporting by organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes and manufacturing equipment by requiring such organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The accounting for lessors will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP; however, the standard requires that lessors expense, on an as-incurred basis, certain initial direct costs that are not incremental in negotiating a lease. Under existing standards, certain of these costs are capitalizable and therefore this new standard will result in certain of these costs being expensed as incurred after adoption. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, and we expect to elect the practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. Under the practical expedients election, we would not be required to reassess: (i) whether an expired or existing contract meets the definition of a lease; (ii) the lease classification at the adoption date for expired or existing leases; and (iii) whether costs previously capitalized as initial direct costs would continue to be amortized. The standard also will require new disclosures within the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements, as well as result in the expensing of certain costs to negotiate and arrange lease agreements. Additionally, in January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases (Subtopic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842\u201d ( ASU 2018-01\u201d), which updates ASU 2016-02 to include land easements under the updated guidance, including the option to elect the practical expedient discussed above. We also plan to adopt ASU 2018-01 when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, and we expect to elect the practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. Our initial analysis of our lease contracts indicates that the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We are still in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02, primarily as it relates to the lease and non-lease components, as well as ASU 2018-01, and related amendments impacting the practical expedients.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which introduces a new model for recognizing credit losses for certain financial instruments, including loans, accounts receivable and debt securities. The new model requires an estimate of expected credit losses over the life of exposure to be recorded through the establishment of an allowance account, which is presented as an offset to the related financial asset. The expected credit loss is recorded upon the initial recognition of the financial asset. The guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with earlier adoption permitted. The guidance will generally be adopted on a modified retrospective basis, with exceptions for certain types of financial assets. We plan on adopting ASU 2016-13 as of the reporting period beginning on January 1, 2020. We do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)\u201d ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues and on reducing diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. Current GAAP does not include specific guidance on these eight cash flow classification issues. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\u201d ( ASU 2016-18\u201d) which requires companies to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 will require a disclosure of a reconciliation between the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows when the statement of financial position includes more than one line item for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents. Entities with material restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents balances will be required to disclose the nature of the restrictions. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We plan on adopting ASU 2016-15 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2018. We do not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-18, we will update the presentation of restricted cash in our current statement of cash flows to conform to the new requirements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\u201d The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align a company's financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. The transition guidance provides companies with the option of early adopting the new standard using a modified retrospective transition method in any interim period after issuance of the update, or alternatively requires adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This adoption method will require us to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that an entity adopts the update. While we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently expect adoption to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. We plan on adopting ASU 2017-12 as of the reporting period beginning on January 1, 2018.\nINFLATION\nIncreases in the costs of owning and operating our properties due to inflation could reduce our net operating income to the extent such increases are not paid or reimbursed by our tenants. Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense reimbursement escalations over a base amount. In addition, our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. As a result, most inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense reimbursement provisions or escalations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective, or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\nInvestment in Real Estate Properties\nWhen we acquire a property, we allocate the purchase price of the acquisition based upon our assessment of the fair value of various components, including to land, building, land and building improvements, and intangible lease assets and liabilities. Fair value determinations are based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as certain available market information. The fair value of land, building, and land and building improvements considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The fair value of intangible lease assets is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, current market conditions and market rates, the tenant's credit quality and costs to execute similar leases. The fair value of above- and below-market leases is calculated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and our estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired and measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider tenant improvements, leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses.\nImpairment of Real Estate Properties\nWe review our investment in real estate properties individually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value of the real estate property and the carrying amount when the estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of the real estate property are less than the real estate property carrying amount. Our estimates of future cash flows and liquidation value require us to make assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, costs to operate each property, and expected ownership periods that can be difficult to predict.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nBlack Creek Diversified Property Fund Inc. is a NAV-based perpetual life REIT that was formed on April 11, 2005, as a Maryland corporation. We are primarily focused on investing in and operating a diverse portfolio of real property. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and managed a real estate portfolio that included 48 properties totaling approximately 7.6 million square feet located in 19 markets throughout the U.S., with 471 tenants.\nWe have operated and elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2006, and we intend to continue to operate in accordance with the requirements for qualification as a REIT. We utilize an UPREIT organizational structure to hold all or substantially all of our assets through the Operating Partnership.\nAs a NAV-based perpetual life REIT, we intend to conduct ongoing public primary offerings of our common stock on a perpetual basis. We also intend to conduct an ongoing distribution reinvestment plan offering for our stockholders to reinvest distributions in our shares. From time to time, we intend to file new registration statements on Form S-11 with the SEC to register additional shares of common stock so that we may continuously offer shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In 2017, we raised $19.9 million from the sale of common stock in our ongoing public primary offering and $23.3 million from the sale of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information about our public offerings. Whenever we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates prior to the Restructuring Date, we are referring to our shares under our prior share structure, and whenever we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates on or after the Restructuring Date, we are referring to our shares under our new share structure.\nWe currently operate in three reportable segments: retail, office and industrial. The following table summarizes our real estate portfolio by segment as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ and square feet in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Markets (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rentable\nSquare Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aggregate\nFair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,148,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,065,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Reflects the number of unique markets by segment and in total. As such, the total number of markets does not equal the sum of the number of markets by segment as certain segments are located in the same market.  We will continue to focus our investment activities on expanding a high-quality, diversified real estate portfolio throughout the U.S. Although we generally target investments in four primary property categories (office, retail, industrial and multifamily), our charter and bylaws do not preclude us from investing in other types of commercial property, real estate debt, or real estate-related equity securities. Our near-term, investment strategy is likely to prioritize new investments in the industrial and multifamily sectors due to attractive fundamental conditions. We have been focused on selling certain non-strategic office and retail assets. The disposition of these properties has helped us to increase our current allocation to industrial real estate assets and liquidity to pursue new investment opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this investment strategy, including with respect to any particular asset class. To a lesser extent we may invest in other types of real\nestate including, but not limited to, hospitality, medical offices, student housing and unimproved land. We currently do not intend in investing in these other types of real estate.\nReal Estate Outlook\nOverall, the U.S. economic environment has continued to improve and remains fundamentally sound. Gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) in the U.S. has continued to grow, and the U.S. unemployment rate is at a relatively low rate. Domestic wage growth has begun to increase, consumer confidence remains high, and tax reform is anticipated to boost corporate profits and reinvestment.\nWhile the U.S. commercial real estate market saw a decline in transaction volume and a slowing of price increases, low vacancy rates and rents continued to outpace inflation resulting in continued net operating income growth.\nThe capital markets outlook for commercial real estate is less clear. While still strong, property fundamentals are slowing and coupled with anticipated Fed tightening and increasing interest rates, price appreciation is moderating at this stage of the cycle. However, investment demand for the asset class remains high, bolstered by an abundance of domestic and foreign capital seeking increased allocations to the sector. With recent increases for inflation expectations, long-term return expectations may improve in the near term. Overall, while there seems to be more runway for real estate fundamentals to improve, there are uncertainties as to how real estate investors will price real estate investments in a rising interest rate environment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSummary of 2017 Activities\nDuring 2017, we completed the following activities:\n \u2022 We acquired two properties comprising 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $40.7 million. \n \u2022 We sold 10 properties aggregating 1.8 million square feet for net proceeds of $269.1 million. \n \u2022 We redeemed or repurchased 23.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted-average purchase price of $7.48 per share for an aggregate amount of $178.4 million. We funded these repurchases with proceeds from dispositions and borrowings under our line of credit. \n \u2022 We entered into three mortgage notes for an aggregate amount of $300.6 million with a weighted-average interest rate spread of 2.41% over one-month LIBOR. \n \u2022 We fully repaid five fixed-rate mortgage notes and one variable-rate mortgage note with an aggregate balance of $165.5 million and $75.0 million, respectively, and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.73% and 3.49%, respectively. We funded the repayment with proceeds from our line of credit, new mortgage note borrowings and real property dispositions discussed above. \n \u2022 We leased 1.2 million square feet, which included 644,000 square feet of new and 592,000 square feet of renewals.  Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We evaluate the performance of consolidated operating properties we own and manage using a same store analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of any material changes in the composition of the aggregate portfolio on performance measures. We have defined the same store portfolio to include consolidated operating properties owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods for which the operations had been stabilized. Other operating properties not meeting the same store criteria are reflected in the non-same store portfolio. The same store operating portfolio for the periods presented below include 45 properties totaling approximately 7.1 million square feet owned as of January 1, 2016, which portfolio represented 94.4% of total rentable square feet as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Rental revenues are comprised of base rent, straight-line rent, amortization of above- and below-market lease assets and liabilities, and tenant reimbursement revenue. Total rental revenues decreased by $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in our same store rental revenues as a result of: (i) a 6.2% decrease in average percentage leased, (ii) a $1.61 decrease in average annualized base rent per square foot and (iii) our Sybase Inc. ( Sybase\u201d) and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ( Schwab\u201d) lease expirations in January 2017 and September 2017, respectively. Average percentage leased and average annualized base rent per square foot for our same store portfolio decreased from 95.7% and $20.44, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 89.5% and $22.05, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. These decreases were primarily driven by the Sybase and Schwab lease expirations, which comprised approximately $12.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of our same store rental revenue decrease. Excluding the impact of the Sybase and Schwab lease expirations, same store rental revenues decreased approximately $0.8 million, or 0.5%, for the periods under comparison.\nThe remaining total rental revenue decrease is attributable to our non-same store portfolio, as we had significant net disposition activity during 2017, partially offset by an acquisition during 2016.

Rental expenses include certain property operating expenses typically reimbursed by our tenants, such as real estate taxes, property insurance, property management fees, repair and maintenance, and include certain non-recoverable expenses, such as consulting services and roof repairs. Total rental expenses increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in rental expenses in our same store portfolio. The Sybase lease expiration in January 2017 led to a $2.6 million increase in rental expenses, as certain rental expenses associated with the Sybase lease are no longer managed and paid directly by the tenant. Excluding the impact of the Sybase lease expiration, same store rental expenses decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 0.1%, to approximately $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $46.9 million for the same period in 2016.\nThe increase in same store rental expenses was partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in our non-same store rental expenses that was primarily attributable to our real property dispositions during 2017.

Total rental revenues decreased by $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to a decrease in our non-same store rental revenues. The decrease in our non-same store rental revenues was primarily due to the disposition of seven properties during 2016, which were partially offset by the acquisition eight properties during 2015. There was a slight decrease in our same store rental revenues that was driven by an increase in same store straight-line rent adjustments due to rent increases and the expiration of rental concessions, lease termination payments received during 2015, and a decrease in recoverable revenue due to a decrease in snow removal costs incurred by our properties in the Greater Boston market due to an unusually harsh winter in 2015. The decrease in same store rental revenues was partially offset by an increase in average percentage leased and average annualized base rent per square foot for our same store portfolio increased from 95.8% and $22.54, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 96.0% and $23.06, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated rental revenues: Table 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,743\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(976\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(287\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of above- and below-market intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant recovery income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues related to early lease terminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental Expenses.

Other expenses increased by $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease of $88.6 million in gain on sale of real estate property largely driven by the disposition of a portfolio of 12 office and industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2015; \n \u2022 a decrease of $6.7 million in interest expense primarily due to: (i) the repayment of nine mortgage notes during 2016 and (ii) a lower aggregate weighted-average interest rate of 3.42% as of December 31, 2016, as compared to 4.07% as of December 31, 2015; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $6.0 million in debt-related income as a result of eight debt-related investment repayments during 2015. We received approximately $81.5 million and $2.6 million from principal repayments and early repayment fees, respectively, in 2015; \n \u2022 partially offset by: \n \u2022 a 2016 gain on extinguishment of debt related to a contingently payable mortgage note that was not ultimately required to be repaid upon the disposition of the related property; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $5.4 million in impairment of real estate property. \nSegment Summary for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nOur segments are based on our internal reporting of operating results used to assess performance based on the type of our properties. Our markets are aggregated into three reportable segments: office, retail and industrial. These segments are comprised of the markets by which management and their operating teams conduct and monitor business. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information on our segments. Management considers rental revenues and net operating income ( NOI\u201d) aggregated by segment to be the appropriate way to analyze performance.

Office Segment NOI decreased by approximately $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of:\n \u2022 $18.5 million decrease in Office Segment rental revenues, driven by the Sybase and Schwab lease expirations, as described above, and our Colshire Drive disposition in February 2016. \n \u2022 $2.0 million increase in Office Segment rental expenses as a result of the Sybase lease expiration, as further detailed above.  Office Segment NOI decreased by approximately $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of a $13.0 million decrease in NOI largely due to the disposition of Colshire Drive.\nRetail Segment. Retail Segment NOI increased by approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of our Suniland Shopping Center acquisition in May 2016.\nRetail Segment NOI increased by approximately $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of:\n \u2022 $9.8 million and $3.7 million increase in rental revenues and rental expenses, respectively, resulting from our four retail property acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015.  Industrial Segment. Industrial Segment NOI increased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of:\n \u2022 our Vasco Road and Northgate acquisitions during 2017, partially offset by our dispositions during the same period.  Industrial Segment NOI decreased by approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of:\n \u2022 the disposition of an industrial portfolio during 2015 consisting of six properties. \nADDITIONAL MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE\nNet Income and NOI\nWe define NOI as GAAP rental revenues less GAAP rental expenses. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because NOI reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties, such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, advisory fees, acquisition expenses, impairment charges, interest expense, gains on sale of properties, other income and expense, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt and noncontrolling interests. However, NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes such items, which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI. Therefore, we believe net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a reconciliation of our GAAP net loss to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nFunds From Operations ( FFO\u201d)\nWe believe that FFO, in addition to net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are useful supplemental performance measures that our management uses to evaluate our consolidated operating performance. However, this supplemental, non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our performance and is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. No single measure can provide users of financial information with sufficient information and only our disclosures read as a whole can be relied upon to adequately portray our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. In addition, other REITs may define FFO and similar measures differently and choose to treat acquisition-related costs and potentially other accounting line items in a manner different from us due to specific differences in investment and operating strategy or for other reasons.\nFFO. As defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), FFO is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization. We believe FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance that is useful to investors because depreciation and amortization in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. By excluding gains or losses on the sale of assets, we believe FFO provides a helpful additional measure of our consolidated operating performance on a comparative basis. We use FFO as an indication of our consolidated operating performance and as a guide to making decisions about future investments.\nThe following unaudited table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net income to NAREIT FFO:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income per common share-basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of GAAP net income to NAREIT FFO:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate-related depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of real estate property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests' share of net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests' share of NAREIT FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,090\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,509\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO attributable to OP Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding-basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding-diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO per common share-basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in NAREIT FFO per common share was primarily due to the expiration of the Sybase and Schwab leases in January 2017 and September 2017, respectively. See Results of Operations\u201d above for further detail.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of capital for meeting our cash requirements include debt financings, cash generated from operating activities, net proceeds from our public offerings, and asset sales. Our principal uses of funds are distributions to our stockholders, payments under our debt obligations, redemption payments, acquisition of properties and other investments, and capital expenditures. Over time, we intend to fund a majority of our cash needs, including the repayment of debt and capital expenditures, from operating cash flows and refinancings. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $277.4 million of borrowings maturing in the next 12 months. Of this amount, we have extended our $275.0 million term loan to January 2019, with another one year extension option. We expect to be able to repay our principal obligations over the next 12 months from operating cash flows and through refinancings, as well as satisfy the certain conditions regarding any future extension options.\nThe Advisor, subject to the oversight of our board of directors and, under certain circumstances, the investment committee or other committees established by our board of directors, will evaluate potential acquisitions and will engage in negotiations with sellers and lenders on our behalf. Pending investment in property, debt, or other investments, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from our public offerings in certain investments that are expected to yield lower returns than those earned on real estate assets. These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of assets, and undistributed funds from operations.\nWe believe that our cash on-hand, anticipated net offering proceeds, proceeds from our line of credit, and other financing and disposition activities should be sufficient to meet our anticipated future acquisition, operating, debt service and distribution and redemption requirements.\nCash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the following periods:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(172,762\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(214,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(178,643\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Cash Flows Compared to 2016 Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net operating income, components of which are discussed previously within Rental Revenues\u201d and Rental Expenses\u201d under Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\u201d.\nNet cash provided by investing activities decreased by approximately $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in cash received from real property dispositions and (ii) a decrease in restricted cash caused by a mortgage note repayment during 2016 that resulted in receipt of escrow restricted to specific capital expenditures, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for real property acquisitions.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to (i) an increase in mortgage note proceeds, (ii) a decrease in mortgage note repayments and (iii) a decrease in cash paid to redeem common stock, which were partially offset by (i) net repayments on our line of credit, (ii) net proceeds from our term loans during 2016, which had no activity during 2017, and (iii) a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\n2016 Cash Flows Compared to 2015 Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to (i) due to a decline in our net operating income, driven by the disposition of a portfolio of 12 office and industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, (ii) unfavorable changes in other assets and liabilities due to annual property tax payments and (iii) a decrease in interest payments received from our debt-related investments, partially offset by (i) a decrease in asset management fees primarily resulting from the common stock redemptions pursuant to our self-tender offers during 2015 and 2016 and (ii) a decrease in interest payments on borrowings.\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased approximately $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash paid to acquire operating properties partially offset by (i) a decrease in proceeds from disposition of real properties, and (ii) a decrease in principal collections on debt-related investments.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased approximately $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the repayment of nine mortgage note borrowings with an aggregate balance of approximately $326.2 million in 2016, partially offset by (i) a decrease in cash paid for redemption of common shares, (ii) an increase in cash received from the sale of our common shares and (ii) a decrease in distributions paid.\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents balances available, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:\nLine of Credit and Term Loans. As of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of $875.0 million of commitments under our credit agreements, including $400.0 million under our line of credit and $475.0 million under our two term loans. As of that date, we had: (i) approximately $142.0 million outstanding under our line of credit with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.27%; and (ii) $475.0 million outstanding under our term loans with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.54%, which includes the effect of the interest rate swap agreements related to $350.0 million in borrowings under our term loans. The unused and available portions under our line of credit were $258.0 million and $145.8 million, respectively. Our $400.0 million line of credit matures in January 2020, and may be extended pursuant to a one-year extension option, subject to\ncertain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. Our $275.0 million term loan matures in January 2019 and our $200.0 million term loan matures in February 2022. In January 2018, we exercised the first of two one-year extension options for our $275.0 million term loan and extended the maturity date to January 2019. Our line of credit and term loan borrowings are available for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to the refinancing of other debt, payment of redemptions, acquisition and operation of permitted investments. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our line of credit and term loans.\nMortgage Notes. As of December 31, 2017, we had property-level borrowings of approximately $401.9 million outstanding with a weighted-average remaining term of approximately 4.2 years. These borrowings are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust and related assignments and security interests in the collateralized properties, and had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.89%, which includes the effects of the interest rate swap agreement relating to our $33.0 million variable-rate mortgage note. The proceeds from our mortgage notes were used to partially finance certain of our acquisitions. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding the mortgage notes.\nDebt Covenants. Our line of credit, term loan and mortgage note agreements contain various property level covenants, including customary affirmative and negative covenants. In addition, our line of credit and term loan agreements contain certain corporate level financial covenants, including leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, and tangible net worth thresholds. These covenants may limit our ability to incur additional debt, to make borrowings under our line of credit, or to pay distributions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nOffering Proceeds. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of aggregate gross proceeds raised from our current public offerings (including shares issued pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan) was $172.0 million ($156.7 million net of direct selling costs).\nDistributions. To obtain the favorable tax treatment accorded to REITs, we normally will be required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for distributions paid and by excluding net capital gains. The payment of distributions is determined by our board of directors and may be adjusted at its discretion at any time. Distribution levels are set by our board of directors at a level it believes to be appropriate and sustainable based upon a review of a variety of factors including the current and anticipated market conditions, current and anticipated future performance and make-up of our investments, our overall financial projections and expected future cash needs. We intend to continue to make distributions on a quarterly basis.\nThe following table outlines sources used, as determined on a GAAP basis, to pay total gross distributions (which are paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock through our distribution reinvestment plan) for the periods indicated below:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Amount reflects the total quarterly distribution rate, subject to adjustment for class-specific fees. \n (2) Includes other cash distributions consisting of: (i) distributions paid to OP Unit holders; (ii) regular distributions made to our former joint venture partners; and (iii) ongoing distribution fees paid to the Dealer Manager with respect to Class T, Class S and Class D shares. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detail regarding the ongoing distribution fees. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our FFO was $65.4 million, or 117.5% of our total distributions, and $90.8 million, or 146.1% of our total distributions, respectively. FFO is a non-GAAP operating metric and should not be used as a liquidity measure. However, management believes the relationship between FFO and distributions may be meaningful for investors to better understand the sustainability of our operating performance compared to distributions made. Refer to Additional Measures of Performance\u201d above for the definition of FFO, as well as a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP net income to FFO.\nRedemptions.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\u201d The standard is based on the principle that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance specifically excludes revenue derived from lease contracts from its scope. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The effective date for the standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2018. Rental revenues and certain tenant reimbursement revenue earned from leasing our operating properties will be evaluated with the adoption of the lease accounting standard (as discussed below). The revised lease accounting standard includes a package of practical expedients that allows an entity to avoid reassessing the accounting for lease components, including the allocations between lease and nonlease components in contracts restated under ASU 2014-09. We expect to elect this package of practical expedients, and accordingly will not reallocate contract consideration to lease components within the scope of the existing lease guidance when we adopt ASU 2014-09. Based on our analysis, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Subtopic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which provides guidance for greater transparency in financial reporting by organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes and manufacturing equipment by requiring such organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The accounting for lessors will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP; however, the standard requires that lessors expense, on an as-incurred basis, certain initial direct costs that are not incremental in negotiating a lease. Under existing standards, certain of these costs are capitalizable and therefore this new standard will result in certain of these costs being expensed as incurred after adoption. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, and we expect to elect the practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. Under the practical expedients election, we would not be required to reassess: (i) whether an expired or existing contract meets the definition of a lease; (ii) the lease classification at the adoption date for expired or existing leases; and (iii) whether costs previously capitalized as initial direct costs would continue to be amortized. The standard also will require new disclosures within the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements, as well as result in the expensing of certain costs to negotiate and arrange lease agreements. Additionally, in January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases (Subtopic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842\u201d ( ASU 2018-01\u201d), which updates ASU 2016-02 to include land easements under the updated guidance, including the option to elect the practical expedient discussed above. We also plan to adopt ASU 2018-01 when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, and we expect to elect the practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. Our initial analysis of our lease contracts indicates that the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We are still in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02, primarily as it relates to the lease and non-lease components, as well as ASU 2018-01, and related amendments impacting the practical expedients.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which introduces a new model for recognizing credit losses for certain financial instruments, including loans, accounts receivable and debt securities. The new model requires an estimate of expected credit losses over the life of exposure to be recorded through the establishment of an allowance account, which is presented as an offset to the related financial asset. The expected credit loss is recorded upon the initial recognition of the financial asset. The guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with earlier adoption permitted. The guidance will generally be adopted on a modified retrospective basis, with exceptions for certain types of financial assets. We plan on adopting ASU 2016-13 as of the reporting period beginning on January 1, 2020. We do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)\u201d ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues and on reducing diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. Current GAAP does not include specific guidance on these eight cash flow classification issues. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\u201d ( ASU 2016-18\u201d) which requires companies to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 will require a disclosure of a reconciliation between the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows when the statement of financial position includes more than one line item for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents. Entities with material restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents balances will be required to disclose the nature of the restrictions. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We plan on adopting ASU 2016-15 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2018. We do not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-18, we will update the presentation of restricted cash in our current statement of cash flows to conform to the new requirements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\u201d The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align a company's financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. The transition guidance provides companies with the option of early adopting the new standard using a modified retrospective transition method in any interim period after issuance of the update, or alternatively requires adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This adoption method will require us to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that an entity adopts the update. While we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently expect adoption to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. We plan on adopting ASU 2017-12 as of the reporting period beginning on January 1, 2018.\nINFLATION\nIncreases in the costs of owning and operating our properties due to inflation could reduce our net operating income to the extent such increases are not paid or reimbursed by our tenants. Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense reimbursement escalations over a base amount. In addition, our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. As a result, most inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense reimbursement provisions or escalations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective, or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\nInvestment in Real Estate Properties\nWhen we acquire a property, we allocate the purchase price of the acquisition based upon our assessment of the fair value of various components, including to land, building, land and building improvements, and intangible lease assets and liabilities. Fair value determinations are based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as certain available market information. The fair value of land, building, and land and building improvements considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The fair value of intangible lease assets is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, current market conditions and market rates, the tenant's credit quality and costs to execute similar leases. The fair value of above- and below-market leases is calculated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and our estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired and measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider tenant improvements, leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses.\nImpairment of Real Estate Properties\nWe review our investment in real estate properties individually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value of the real estate property and the carrying amount when the estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of the real estate property are less than the real estate property carrying amount. Our estimates of future cash flows and liquidation value require us to make assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, costs to operate each property, and expected ownership periods that can be difficult to predict.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nBlack Creek Diversified Property Fund Inc. is a NAV-based perpetual life REIT that was formed on April 11, 2005, as a Maryland corporation. We are primarily focused on investing in and operating a diverse portfolio of real property. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and managed a real estate portfolio that included 48 properties totaling approximately 7.6 million square feet located in 19 markets throughout the U.S., with 471 tenants.\nWe have operated and elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2006, and we intend to continue to operate in accordance with the requirements for qualification as a REIT. We utilize an UPREIT organizational structure to hold all or substantially all of our assets through the Operating Partnership.\nAs a NAV-based perpetual life REIT, we intend to conduct ongoing public primary offerings of our common stock on a perpetual basis. We also intend to conduct an ongoing distribution reinvestment plan offering for our stockholders to reinvest distributions in our shares. From time to time, we intend to file new registration statements on Form S-11 with the SEC to register additional shares of common stock so that we may continuously offer shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In 2017, we raised $19.9 million from the sale of common stock in our ongoing public primary offering and $23.3 million from the sale of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information about our public offerings. Whenever we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates prior to the Restructuring Date, we are referring to our shares under our prior share structure, and whenever we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates on or after the Restructuring Date, we are referring to our shares under our new share structure.\nWe currently operate in three reportable segments: retail, office and industrial. The following table summarizes our real estate portfolio by segment as of December 31, 2017:\n\n \n (1) Reflects the number of unique markets by segment and in total. As such, the total number of markets does not equal the sum of the number of markets by segment as certain segments are located in the same market.  We will continue to focus our investment activities on expanding a high-quality, diversified real estate portfolio throughout the U.S. Although we generally target investments in four primary property categories (office, retail, industrial and multifamily), our charter and bylaws do not preclude us from investing in other types of commercial property, real estate debt, or real estate-related equity securities. Our near-term, investment strategy is likely to prioritize new investments in the industrial and multifamily sectors due to attractive fundamental conditions. We have been focused on selling certain non-strategic office and retail assets. The disposition of these properties has helped us to increase our current allocation to industrial real estate assets and liquidity to pursue new investment opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this investment strategy, including with respect to any particular asset class. To a lesser extent we may invest in other types of real\nestate including, but not limited to, hospitality, medical offices, student housing and unimproved land. We currently do not intend in investing in these other types of real estate.\nReal Estate Outlook\nOverall, the U.S. economic environment has continued to improve and remains fundamentally sound. Gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) in the U.S. has continued to grow, and the U.S. unemployment rate is at a relatively low rate. Domestic wage growth has begun to increase, consumer confidence remains high, and tax reform is anticipated to boost corporate profits and reinvestment.\nWhile the U.S. commercial real estate market saw a decline in transaction volume and a slowing of price increases, low vacancy rates and rents continued to outpace inflation resulting in continued net operating income growth.\nThe capital markets outlook for commercial real estate is less clear. While still strong, property fundamentals are slowing and coupled with anticipated Fed tightening and increasing interest rates, price appreciation is moderating at this stage of the cycle. However, investment demand for the asset class remains high, bolstered by an abundance of domestic and foreign capital seeking increased allocations to the sector. With recent increases for inflation expectations, long-term return expectations may improve in the near term. Overall, while there seems to be more runway for real estate fundamentals to improve, there are uncertainties as to how real estate investors will price real estate investments in a rising interest rate environment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSummary of 2017 Activities\nDuring 2017, we completed the following activities:\n \u2022 We acquired two properties comprising 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $40.7 million. \n \u2022 We sold 10 properties aggregating 1.8 million square feet for net proceeds of $269.1 million. \n \u2022 We redeemed or repurchased 23.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted-average purchase price of $7.48 per share for an aggregate amount of $178.4 million. We funded these repurchases with proceeds from dispositions and borrowings under our line of credit. \n \u2022 We entered into three mortgage notes for an aggregate amount of $300.6 million with a weighted-average interest rate spread of 2.41% over one-month LIBOR. \n \u2022 We fully repaid five fixed-rate mortgage notes and one variable-rate mortgage note with an aggregate balance of $165.5 million and $75.0 million, respectively, and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.73% and 3.49%, respectively. We funded the repayment with proceeds from our line of credit, new mortgage note borrowings and real property dispositions discussed above. \n \u2022 We leased 1.2 million square feet, which included 644,000 square feet of new and 592,000 square feet of renewals.  Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We evaluate the performance of consolidated operating properties we own and manage using a same store analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of any material changes in the composition of the aggregate portfolio on performance measures. We have defined the same store portfolio to include consolidated operating properties owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods for which the operations had been stabilized. Other operating properties not meeting the same store criteria are reflected in the non-same store portfolio. The same store operating portfolio for the periods presented below include 45 properties totaling approximately 7.1 million square feet owned as of January 1, 2016, which portfolio represented 94.4% of total rentable square feet as of December 31, 2017.\n\nRental Revenues. Rental revenues are comprised of base rent, straight-line rent, amortization of above- and below-market lease assets and liabilities, and tenant reimbursement revenue. Total rental revenues decreased by $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in our same store rental revenues as a result of: (i) a 6.2% decrease in average percentage leased, (ii) a $1.61 decrease in average annualized base rent per square foot and (iii) our Sybase Inc. ( Sybase\u201d) and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ( Schwab\u201d) lease expirations in January 2017 and September 2017, respectively. Average percentage leased and average annualized base rent per square foot for our same store portfolio decreased from 95.7% and $20.44, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 89.5% and $22.05, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. These decreases were primarily driven by the Sybase and Schwab lease expirations, which comprised approximately $12.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of our same store rental revenue decrease. Excluding the impact of the Sybase and Schwab lease expirations, same store rental revenues decreased approximately $0.8 million, or 0.5%, for the periods under comparison.\nThe remaining total rental revenue decrease is attributable to our non-same store portfolio, as we had significant net disposition activity during 2017, partially offset by an acquisition during 2016. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information concerning our real property dispositions and acquisition.\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated rental revenues: \nRental Expenses. Rental expenses include certain property operating expenses typically reimbursed by our tenants, such as real estate taxes, property insurance, property management fees, repair and maintenance, and include certain non-recoverable expenses, such as consulting services and roof repairs. Total rental expenses increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in rental expenses in our same store portfolio. The Sybase lease expiration in January 2017 led to a $2.6 million increase in rental expenses, as certain rental expenses associated with the Sybase lease are no longer managed and paid directly by the tenant. Excluding the impact of the Sybase lease expiration, same store rental expenses decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 0.1%, to approximately $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $46.9 million for the same period in 2016.\nThe increase in same store rental expenses was partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in our non-same store rental expenses that was primarily attributable to our real property dispositions during 2017. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information concerning our real property dispositions.\nThe following table presents the various components of our rental expenses:\n\nOther Expenses. Other expenses decreased by $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase of $37.4 million in gain on sale of real estate property as a result of more dispositions in 2017; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $12.0 million in real estate-related depreciation and amortization primarily due to our dispositions during 2017; \n \u2022 partially offset by a gain on extinguishment of debt of $5.1 million in 2016 related to a contingently payable mortgage note that was not ultimately required to be repaid upon the disposition of the related property. \nResults for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The same store operating portfolio for the periods presented below include 37 properties totaling approximately 5.7 million square feet owned as of January 1, 2015, which portfolio represented 63.8% of total rentable square feet as of December 31, 2016. \nRental Revenues. Total rental revenues decreased by $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to a decrease in our non-same store rental revenues. The decrease in our non-same store rental revenues was primarily due to the disposition of seven properties during 2016, which were partially offset by the acquisition eight properties during 2015. There was a slight decrease in our same store rental revenues that was driven by an increase in same store straight-line rent adjustments due to rent increases and the expiration of rental concessions, lease termination payments received during 2015, and a decrease in recoverable revenue due to a decrease in snow removal costs incurred by our properties in the Greater Boston market due to an unusually harsh winter in 2015. The decrease in same store rental revenues was partially offset by an increase in average percentage leased and average annualized base rent per square foot for our same store portfolio increased from 95.8% and $22.54, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 96.0% and $23.06, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated rental revenues: \nRental Expenses. Total rental expenses increased by $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, which was primarily driven by the increase in our non-same store rental expenses due to the acquisition of eight multi-tenant properties during 2015 that typically included gross leases whereby we managed and paid rental expenses as compared to the properties sold in 2015 that typically included net leases with most rental expenses managed and paid by the tenant directly.\nThe following table presents the various components of our rental expenses:\n\nOther Expenses. Other expenses increased by $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease of $88.6 million in gain on sale of real estate property largely driven by the disposition of a portfolio of 12 office and industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2015; \n \u2022 a decrease of $6.7 million in interest expense primarily due to: (i) the repayment of nine mortgage notes during 2016 and (ii) a lower aggregate weighted-average interest rate of 3.42% as of December 31, 2016, as compared to 4.07% as of December 31, 2015; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $6.0 million in debt-related income as a result of eight debt-related investment repayments during 2015. We received approximately $81.5 million and $2.6 million from principal repayments and early repayment fees, respectively, in 2015; \n \u2022 partially offset by: \n \u2022 a 2016 gain on extinguishment of debt related to a contingently payable mortgage note that was not ultimately required to be repaid upon the disposition of the related property; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $5.4 million in impairment of real estate property. \nSegment Summary for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nOur segments are based on our internal reporting of operating results used to assess performance based on the type of our properties. Our markets are aggregated into three reportable segments: office, retail and industrial. These segments are comprised of the markets by which management and their operating teams conduct and monitor business. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information on our segments. Management considers rental revenues and net operating income ( NOI\u201d) aggregated by segment to be the appropriate way to analyze performance. See Additional Measures of Performance\u201d below for detail regarding the use of NOI.\nThe following table summarizes certain operating trends in our consolidated properties by segment:\n\nOffice Segment. Office Segment NOI decreased by approximately $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of:\n \u2022 $18.5 million decrease in Office Segment rental revenues, driven by the Sybase and Schwab lease expirations, as described above, and our Colshire Drive disposition in February 2016. \n \u2022 $2.0 million increase in Office Segment rental expenses as a result of the Sybase lease expiration, as further detailed above.  Office Segment NOI decreased by approximately $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of a $13.0 million decrease in NOI largely due to the disposition of Colshire Drive.\nRetail Segment. Retail Segment NOI increased by approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of our Suniland Shopping Center acquisition in May 2016.\nRetail Segment NOI increased by approximately $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of:\n \u2022 $9.8 million and $3.7 million increase in rental revenues and rental expenses, respectively, resulting from our four retail property acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015.  Industrial Segment. Industrial Segment NOI increased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of:\n \u2022 our Vasco Road and Northgate acquisitions during 2017, partially offset by our dispositions during the same period.  Industrial Segment NOI decreased by approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of:\n \u2022 the disposition of an industrial portfolio during 2015 consisting of six properties. \nADDITIONAL MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE\nNet Income and NOI\nWe define NOI as GAAP rental revenues less GAAP rental expenses. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because NOI reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties, such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, advisory fees, acquisition expenses, impairment charges, interest expense, gains on sale of properties, other income and expense, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt and noncontrolling interests. However, NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes such items, which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI. Therefore, we believe net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a reconciliation of our GAAP net loss to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nFunds From Operations ( FFO\u201d)\nWe believe that FFO, in addition to net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are useful supplemental performance measures that our management uses to evaluate our consolidated operating performance. However, this supplemental, non-GAAP measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our performance and is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. No single measure can provide users of financial information with sufficient information and only our disclosures read as a whole can be relied upon to adequately portray our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. In addition, other REITs may define FFO and similar measures differently and choose to treat acquisition-related costs and potentially other accounting line items in a manner different from us due to specific differences in investment and operating strategy or for other reasons.\nFFO. As defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), FFO is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization. We believe FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance that is useful to investors because depreciation and amortization in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. By excluding gains or losses on the sale of assets, we believe FFO provides a helpful additional measure of our consolidated operating performance on a comparative basis. We use FFO as an indication of our consolidated operating performance and as a guide to making decisions about future investments.\nThe following unaudited table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net income to NAREIT FFO:\n\nThe decrease in NAREIT FFO per common share was primarily due to the expiration of the Sybase and Schwab leases in January 2017 and September 2017, respectively. See Results of Operations\u201d above for further detail.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of capital for meeting our cash requirements include debt financings, cash generated from operating activities, net proceeds from our public offerings, and asset sales. Our principal uses of funds are distributions to our stockholders, payments under our debt obligations, redemption payments, acquisition of properties and other investments, and capital expenditures. Over time, we intend to fund a majority of our cash needs, including the repayment of debt and capital expenditures, from operating cash flows and refinancings. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $277.4 million of borrowings maturing in the next 12 months. Of this amount, we have extended our $275.0 million term loan to January 2019, with another one year extension option. We expect to be able to repay our principal obligations over the next 12 months from operating cash flows and through refinancings, as well as satisfy the certain conditions regarding any future extension options.\nThe Advisor, subject to the oversight of our board of directors and, under certain circumstances, the investment committee or other committees established by our board of directors, will evaluate potential acquisitions and will engage in negotiations with sellers and lenders on our behalf. Pending investment in property, debt, or other investments, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from our public offerings in certain investments that are expected to yield lower returns than those earned on real estate assets. These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of assets, and undistributed funds from operations.\nWe believe that our cash on-hand, anticipated net offering proceeds, proceeds from our line of credit, and other financing and disposition activities should be sufficient to meet our anticipated future acquisition, operating, debt service and distribution and redemption requirements.\nCash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the following periods:\n\n2017 Cash Flows Compared to 2016 Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net operating income, components of which are discussed previously within Rental Revenues\u201d and Rental Expenses\u201d under Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\u201d.\nNet cash provided by investing activities decreased by approximately $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in cash received from real property dispositions and (ii) a decrease in restricted cash caused by a mortgage note repayment during 2016 that resulted in receipt of escrow restricted to specific capital expenditures, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for real property acquisitions.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to (i) an increase in mortgage note proceeds, (ii) a decrease in mortgage note repayments and (iii) a decrease in cash paid to redeem common stock, which were partially offset by (i) net repayments on our line of credit, (ii) net proceeds from our term loans during 2016, which had no activity during 2017, and (iii) a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\n2016 Cash Flows Compared to 2015 Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to (i) due to a decline in our net operating income, driven by the disposition of a portfolio of 12 office and industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, (ii) unfavorable changes in other assets and liabilities due to annual property tax payments and (iii) a decrease in interest payments received from our debt-related investments, partially offset by (i) a decrease in asset management fees primarily resulting from the common stock redemptions pursuant to our self-tender offers during 2015 and 2016 and (ii) a decrease in interest payments on borrowings.\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased approximately $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash paid to acquire operating properties partially offset by (i) a decrease in proceeds from disposition of real properties, and (ii) a decrease in principal collections on debt-related investments.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased approximately $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the repayment of nine mortgage note borrowings with an aggregate balance of approximately $326.2 million in 2016, partially offset by (i) a decrease in cash paid for redemption of common shares, (ii) an increase in cash received from the sale of our common shares and (ii) a decrease in distributions paid.\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents balances available, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:\nLine of Credit and Term Loans. As of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of $875.0 million of commitments under our credit agreements, including $400.0 million under our line of credit and $475.0 million under our two term loans. As of that date, we had: (i) approximately $142.0 million outstanding under our line of credit with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.27%; and (ii) $475.0 million outstanding under our term loans with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.54%, which includes the effect of the interest rate swap agreements related to $350.0 million in borrowings under our term loans. The unused and available portions under our line of credit were $258.0 million and $145.8 million, respectively. Our $400.0 million line of credit matures in January 2020, and may be extended pursuant to a one-year extension option, subject to\ncertain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. Our $275.0 million term loan matures in January 2019 and our $200.0 million term loan matures in February 2022. In January 2018, we exercised the first of two one-year extension options for our $275.0 million term loan and extended the maturity date to January 2019. Our line of credit and term loan borrowings are available for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to the refinancing of other debt, payment of redemptions, acquisition and operation of permitted investments. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our line of credit and term loans.\nMortgage Notes. As of December 31, 2017, we had property-level borrowings of approximately $401.9 million outstanding with a weighted-average remaining term of approximately 4.2 years. These borrowings are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust and related assignments and security interests in the collateralized properties, and had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.89%, which includes the effects of the interest rate swap agreement relating to our $33.0 million variable-rate mortgage note. The proceeds from our mortgage notes were used to partially finance certain of our acquisitions. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding the mortgage notes.\nDebt Covenants. Our line of credit, term loan and mortgage note agreements contain various property level covenants, including customary affirmative and negative covenants. In addition, our line of credit and term loan agreements contain certain corporate level financial covenants, including leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, and tangible net worth thresholds. These covenants may limit our ability to incur additional debt, to make borrowings under our line of credit, or to pay distributions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nOffering Proceeds. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of aggregate gross proceeds raised from our current public offerings (including shares issued pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan) was $172.0 million ($156.7 million net of direct selling costs).\nDistributions. To obtain the favorable tax treatment accorded to REITs, we normally will be required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for distributions paid and by excluding net capital gains. The payment of distributions is determined by our board of directors and may be adjusted at its discretion at any time. Distribution levels are set by our board of directors at a level it believes to be appropriate and sustainable based upon a review of a variety of factors including the current and anticipated market conditions, current and anticipated future performance and make-up of our investments, our overall financial projections and expected future cash needs. We intend to continue to make distributions on a quarterly basis.\nThe following table outlines sources used, as determined on a GAAP basis, to pay total gross distributions (which are paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock through our distribution reinvestment plan) for the periods indicated below:\n\n \n (1) Amount reflects the total quarterly distribution rate, subject to adjustment for class-specific fees. \n (2) Includes other cash distributions consisting of: (i) distributions paid to OP Unit holders; (ii) regular distributions made to our former joint venture partners; and (iii) ongoing distribution fees paid to the Dealer Manager with respect to Class T, Class S and Class D shares. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detail regarding the ongoing distribution fees. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our FFO was $65.4 million, or 117.5% of our total distributions, and $90.8 million, or 146.1% of our total distributions, respectively. FFO is a non-GAAP operating metric and should not be used as a liquidity measure. However, management believes the relationship between FFO and distributions may be meaningful for investors to better understand the sustainability of our operating performance compared to distributions made. Refer to Additional Measures of Performance\u201d above for the definition of FFO, as well as a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP net income to FFO.\nRedemptions. Below is a summary of redemptions and repurchases pursuant to our share redemption program and self-tender offers for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our board of directors may modify, suspend or terminate our current share redemption programs if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders. Refer to Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchasers of Equity Securities-Share Redemption Program\u201d for detail regarding our share redemption program.\n\nIn addition, refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for detail regarding our redemption activity relating to OP Units.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes future obligations, due by period, as of December 31, 2017, under our various contractual obligations and commitments:\n\n \n (1) Includes principal and interest on our borrowings. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more detail. \n (2) Includes a ground lease at an office property and lease payments pursuant to the DST Program.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\u201d The standard is based on the principle that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance specifically excludes revenue derived from lease contracts from its scope. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The effective date for the standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2018. Rental revenues and certain tenant reimbursement revenue earned from leasing our operating properties will be evaluated with the adoption of the lease accounting standard (as discussed below). The revised lease accounting standard includes a package of practical expedients that allows an entity to avoid reassessing the accounting for lease components, including the allocations between lease and nonlease components in contracts restated under ASU 2014-09. We expect to elect this package of practical expedients, and accordingly will not reallocate contract consideration to lease components within the scope of the existing lease guidance when we adopt ASU 2014-09. Based on our analysis, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Subtopic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which provides guidance for greater transparency in financial reporting by organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes and manufacturing equipment by requiring such organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The accounting for lessors will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP; however, the standard requires that lessors expense, on an as-incurred basis, certain initial direct costs that are not incremental in negotiating a lease. Under existing standards, certain of these costs are capitalizable and therefore this new standard will result in certain of these costs being expensed as incurred after adoption. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, and we expect to elect the practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. Under the practical expedients election, we would not be required to reassess: (i) whether an expired or existing contract meets the definition of a lease; (ii) the lease classification at the adoption date for expired or existing leases; and (iii) whether costs previously capitalized as initial direct costs would continue to be amortized. The standard also will require new disclosures within the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements, as well as result in the expensing of certain costs to negotiate and arrange lease agreements. Additionally, in January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases (Subtopic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842\u201d ( ASU 2018-01\u201d), which updates ASU 2016-02 to include land easements under the updated guidance, including the option to elect the practical expedient discussed above. We also plan to adopt ASU 2018-01 when it becomes effective for us, as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, and we expect to elect the practical expedients available for implementation under the standard. Our initial analysis of our lease contracts indicates that the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We are still in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02, primarily as it relates to the lease and non-lease components, as well as ASU 2018-01, and related amendments impacting the practical expedients.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which introduces a new model for recognizing credit losses for certain financial instruments, including loans, accounts receivable and debt securities. The new model requires an estimate of expected credit losses over the life of exposure to be recorded through the establishment of an allowance account, which is presented as an offset to the related financial asset. The expected credit loss is recorded upon the initial recognition of the financial asset. The guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with earlier adoption permitted. The guidance will generally be adopted on a modified retrospective basis, with exceptions for certain types of financial assets. We plan on adopting ASU 2016-13 as of the reporting period beginning on January 1, 2020. We do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)\u201d ( ASU 2016-15\u201d), which provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues and on reducing diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. Current GAAP does not include specific guidance on these eight cash flow classification issues. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\u201d ( ASU 2016-18\u201d) which requires companies to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 will require a disclosure of a reconciliation between the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows when the statement of financial position includes more than one line item for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents. Entities with material restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents balances will be required to disclose the nature of the restrictions. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We plan on adopting ASU 2016-15 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2018. We do not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-18, we will update the presentation of restricted cash in our current statement of cash flows to conform to the new requirements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\u201d The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align a company's financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. The transition guidance provides companies with the option of early adopting the new standard using a modified retrospective transition method in any interim period after issuance of the update, or alternatively requires adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This adoption method will require us to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that an entity adopts the update. While we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently expect adoption to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. We plan on adopting ASU 2017-12 as of the reporting period beginning on January 1, 2018.\nINFLATION\nIncreases in the costs of owning and operating our properties due to inflation could reduce our net operating income to the extent such increases are not paid or reimbursed by our tenants. Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense reimbursement escalations over a base amount. In addition, our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. As a result, most inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense reimbursement provisions or escalations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective, or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\nInvestment in Real Estate Properties\nWhen we acquire a property, we allocate the purchase price of the acquisition based upon our assessment of the fair value of various components, including to land, building, land and building improvements, and intangible lease assets and liabilities. Fair value determinations are based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as certain available market information. The fair value of land, building, and land and building improvements considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The fair value of intangible lease assets is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, current market conditions and market rates, the tenant's credit quality and costs to execute similar leases. The fair value of above- and below-market leases is calculated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and our estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired and measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider tenant improvements, leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses.\nImpairment of Real Estate Properties\nWe review our investment in real estate properties individually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value of the real estate property and the carrying amount when the estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of the real estate property are less than the real estate property carrying amount. Our estimates of future cash flows and liquidation value require us to make assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, costs to operate each property, and expected ownership periods that can be difficult to predict.", "item_7_tables": "Table 93: <table><tr><td> </td>
