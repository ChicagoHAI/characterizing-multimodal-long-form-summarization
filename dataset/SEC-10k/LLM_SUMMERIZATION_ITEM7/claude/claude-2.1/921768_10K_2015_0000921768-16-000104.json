BBX Capital Corporation's principal asset until July 31, 2012 was its ownership of BankAtlantic and its subsidiaries. BankAtlantic was a federal savings bank headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and provided traditional retail banking services and a wide range of commercial banking products and related financial services through a broad network of community branches located in Florida. On July 31, 2012, BBX Capital completed the sale to BB&T of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of BankAtlantic (the BB&T Transaction\u201d).\nBBX Capital's activities subsequent to the consummation of the BB&T Transaction involve the ownership, acquisition, investment and management of real estate and real estate development projects as well as its investments in operating businesses.\nBBX Capital's investments in real estate joint ventures generally were arrangements with developers for residential and commercial development projects in which BBX Capital has funded its equity investment in joint ventures through cash investments or by contributing real estate properties.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nBBX Capital reports its consolidated results of operations in three reportable segments, BBX, Renin and Sweet Holdings.\nIncome (loss) from each of BBX Capital's reportable segments was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBBX\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>33,334 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>3,224 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>48,659 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRenin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,058) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(2,044) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(941) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSweet Holdings\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(8,767) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>23 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(38) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReconciling item (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>773 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23,282 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,203 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>47,680 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(245) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(3,101) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>20 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>23,527 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>4,304 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>47,660 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRepresents capitalized interest on real estate development and joint venture activities in excess of interest expense incurred in the BBX reportable segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nBBX Reportable Segment\nThe increase in BBX reportable segment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from a $25.6 million increase in net gains on the sales of assets, $6.3 million of higher recoveries from loan losses and a $6.7 million reduction in asset impairments. The above improvements in BBX reportable segment income were partially offset by $10.3 million of lower equity in earnings from BBX Capital's investment in Woodbridge.\nGains on sales of assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $31.1 million compared to $5.5 million during the comparable 2014 period. The gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2015 resulted primarily from the sales of four properties. Two of the properties were located in West Palm Beach, Florida, a third property was located in the Bonterra master-planned community and the fourth property was acquired through a loan participation and sold by the lead bank. BBX recognized aggregate gains of $31.4 million in connection with sales of these four properties.\nRecoveries for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $13.5 million compared to $7.2 million during the comparable 2014 period. The improvement in recoveries during 2015 was mainly due to lower charge-offs and higher recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015 charge-offs were $1.0 million compared to $7.2 million during the same 2014 period.\nThe lower asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from $8.6 million of impairments on two student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a $1.8 million additional impairment on one of the student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe $10.3 million decline in the equity in earnings of Woodbridge resulted primarily from Woodbridge's $36.5 million settlement of litigation brought by Bluegreen's former shareholders related to Woodbridge's April 2013 acquisition of Bluegreen as described in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. As BBX has a 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge, the $36.5 million settlement reduced BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge by $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The reduction in BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge as a consequence of the litigation settlement was partially offset by improved earnings at Bluegreen. Bluegreen's net income attributable to shareholder was $68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $54.5 million during the comparable 2014 period.\nThe decline in BBX reportable segment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same 2013 period resulted primarily from $36.7 million of lower recoveries from loan losses and a $18.9 million decline in interest income recoveries associated with the repayment of non-accrual loans. The above declines in BBX reportable segment income were partially offset by $11.8 million of higher equity earnings from BBX Capital's investment in Woodbridge and lower interest expense associated with BB&T's preferred interest in FAR.\nRecoveries from loan losses and interest income recognized on non-accrual loans were $7.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $43.9 million and $24.3 million during the same 2013 period, respectively. The significant loan loss recoveries and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from a settlement with a borrower which resulted in reversals of previously charged-off commercial loans of $20.1 million and interest income recoveries of $13.6 million.\nBBX Capital's equity in earnings of Woodbridge was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $13.5 million during the same 2013 period. Equity in earnings of Woodbridge for the year ended December 31, 2013 were from the date of the investment (April 2, 2013) through December 31, 2013.\nRenin Reportable Segment\nRenin's reportable segment loss during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from $1.0 million of foreign exchange losses and expenses associated with the hiring of additional sales representatives and advertising expenditures for sales initiatives during 2015 as well as consulting expenditures to achieve product development and manufacturing efficiencies. Renin's new members of management include its CEO hired in June 2015 and a Vice President of Sales hired in September 2015. Renin incurred severance costs associated with the reorganization of its marketing and corporate personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015. Renin improved its gross margin and gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period as a greater proportion of Renin's trade sales were higher margin hardware products. Renin's interest expense was lower during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period as Renin refinanced its notes payable in June 2014 at lower interest rates.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRenin's reportable segment loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from a $0.7 million loss on foreign currency exchange and $0.9 million of costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in Canada.\nRenin's reportable segment loss for the two months ended December 31, 2013 included $1.0 million of acquisition related costs offset by a $1.0 million bargain purchase gain. Management believes that it was able to acquire Renin for a bargain purchase gain because Renin Corp. was a distressed company.\nSweet Holdings Reportable Segment\nThe higher Sweet Holdings reportable segment loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, inventory markdowns as well as lower acquisition bargain purchase gains partially offset by an increase in trade sales associated with acquired companies.\nThe higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects operating expenses associated with companies acquired and costs to integrate these companies as well as increased compensation expense related to the hiring of industry professionals and fees to consultants. Executives hired during the first quarter of 2015 included a President for BBX Sweet Holdings and a President for Hoffman's. Also contributing to higher selling, general and administrative expenses were costs associated with relocating the Helen Grace California manufacturing facilities to Kencraft's manufacturing facilities in Utah and costs associated with Hoffman's retail store expansion initiatives. Hoffman's opened one retail location during the third quarter of 2014 as well as three retail locations during the year ended December 31, 2015 and anticipates opening additional retail locations in 2016. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.3 million of employee severance expenses and costs to relocate the Helen Grace manufacturing facilities to Utah.\nThe gross margin was adversely affected for the year ended December 31, 2015 by $600,000 of inventory markdowns and the relocation of Helen Grace's manufacturing facilities from California to Utah in September 2015.\nThe bargain purchase gain of $254,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 was associated with the Kencraft acquisition and the bargain purchase gain of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was associated with the Helen Grace acquisition.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe benefit for income taxes of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from acquisition re-measurement adjustments and a reduction in BBX Capital's deferred tax valuation allowance as a result of net taxable temporary differences that Sweet Holdings recognized in connection with the Kencraft acquisition.\nThe $3.1 million benefit for income taxes represents the reduction in BBX Capital's deferred tax valuation allowance as a result of net taxable temporary differences that Sweet Holdings recognized in connection with its 2014 acquisitions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBBX Reportable Segment Results of Operations\nThe following table is a

December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects higher interest income recognized on a cash basis from the payoffs of nonaccrual loans partially offset by lower interest income recognized on accruing loans associated with declining accruing loan balances due primarily to loan repayments and loan sales. Accruing loan balances declined from $23.0 million as of December 31, 2013 to $6.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, $5.8 million of interest income was recognized on the payoff of two commercial loans.\nThe decline in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower interest income recognized on a cash basis from the settlement of non-accrual loans and secondarily from lower interest income recognized on accruing loans due primarily to lower accruing loan balances.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, $13.6 million of interest income was recovered in connection with the repayment of non-accrual loans pursuant to a settlement agreement with respect to litigation between CAM and Daniel S. Catalfumo and certain members of his family and affiliated entities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNet Gains on the Sales of Assets\nThe net gains on the sales of assets during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were primarily gains on the sales of real estate properties.\nGains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the sales of four properties. Two of the properties were located in West Palm Beach, Florida. One of the properties, which was purchased by the JRG/BBX Development joint venture for $10.8 million, was sold to a third party developer for $20.0 million. A second property, which had a $3.2 million carrying value at the date of sale, was acquired by BBX through foreclosure and sold for $11.0 million. A third property was located in the Bonterra master-planned community in Hialeah, Florida, had a carrying value of $13.9 million and sold for $26.2 million. The fourth property was acquired through foreclosure in Las Vegas, Nevada, had a carrying value of $2.6 million and sold for $6.0 million. BBX recognized gains of $31.4 million in the aggregate in connection with these four property sales.\nIncluded in net gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2014 was a $2.5 million gain on the sale of one property, the sale of first lien consumer and residential loans for a $0.6 million gain and gains of $1.3 million on the sales of various real estate properties.\nIncluded in net gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2013 was a $1.5 million gain from the sale of rental property, $0.9 million of gains associated with the sale of tax certificates, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a storage facility and a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale commercial real estate loan.\nIncome from Real Estate Operations\nIncome from real estate operations consists of rental income from foreclosed properties.\nThe lower income from real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from the sales of rental properties and one operating property during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe increase in income from real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same 2013 period reflects an increase in the number of income producing foreclosed properties which resulted in higher rental income during 2014 compared to 2013. The additional foreclosed properties included two student housing facilities that BBX acquired through settlements with borrowers in September 2013 and January 2014.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted mainly of $1.5 million of rental income from a public storage operating facility that was acquired through foreclosure in April 2013, $0.4 million of office facilities revenues paid by BFC for use of its office space and $0.4 million of management fees recognized from Sweet Holdings. The Sweet Holdings management fees were eliminated in consolidation.\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted mainly of $1.2 million of rental income associated with a public storage operating facility, $0.6 million of income associated with a foreclosed loan, $0.4 million of office facilities revenues from BFC and $0.2 million of management fees from Sweet Holdings.\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted mainly of $0.7 million of rental income associated with the public storage operating facility, $0.9 million of income associated with a foreclosed loan, $0.7 million of recoveries on loans in excess of contractual principal, $0.2 million of deposit overdraft recoveries associated with the charged off deposit overdraft portfolio retained in the BB&T Transaction and $0.4 million of office facilities revenues from BFC.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBB&Ts Priority Return in FAR Distributions\nBB&T's priority return in FAR distributions during the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 represented the priority return paid to BB&T pursuant to its preferred membership interests in FAR. The required priority return was set at LIBOR + 200 basis points per annum on the unpaid preferred membership interest preference amount. The preferred membership interest preference amount was reduced from $196.9 million as of December 31, 2012 to $72.1 million as of December 31, 2013 to $12.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and was paid in full in May 2015. FAR utilized cash receipts primarily from loan repayments and the sales of assets to repay the preference amount and fund the priority return.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 $0.4 million of BBX reportable segment interest expense was capitalized in connection with real estate development and joint venture activities. The capitalized interest expense for year ended December 31, 2015 was incurred in connection with the Woodbridge promissory note. The Woodbridge promissory note was repaid in full during September 2015.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from $0.6 million of interest expense recognized on the Woodbridge promissory note and $0.2 million of interest expense recognized on the Florida Community Bank mortgage. The $8.3 million Florida Community Bank mortgage was assumed by the Hialeah Communities joint venture in June 2014.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted from two notes payable aggregating $10.3 million issued as of December 31, 2012. The notes were issued to two third party participants in loans for which BBX Capital was the lead lender in connection with BBX Capital's acquisition of the participants' interest in a loan and certain real estate property. One note payable in the amount of $2.5 million was repaid in December 2013.\nReal Estate Operating Expenses\nReal estate operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 represent real estate holding costs, including taxes and insurance, associated with real estate acquired through foreclosure.\nThe decline in real estate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the sale of properties and the transfer of properties to real estate joint ventures.\nThe increase in real estate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from loan foreclosures.\nRecoveries from Loan Losses\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for Loan Losses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>977 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>2,713 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>5,311 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCharge-offs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,037) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(7,189) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(10,867) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecoveries\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,517 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>12,608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>52,134 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecoveries from loan losses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(13,457) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(7,155) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(43,865) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance, end of period\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>977 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>2,713 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were mainly second-lien consumer loans.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLoan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of a charge-off of a $1.9 million commercial non-mortgage business loan, $2.7 million of charge-offs associated with the transfer of performing second lien consumer loans to loans held-for-sale and $0.7 million of charge-offs due to initial charge downs on loans past due greater than 120 days and first lien foreclosures. The remaining charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2014 related primarily to updated valuations on collateral dependent loans.\nLoan charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of consumer and residential loan charge-offs of $3.3 million and charge-offs of $0.7 million upon the transfer of the loans to loans held-for-sale. The remaining charge-offs reflect updated valuations on non-accrual loans and initial charge downs on loans past due greater than 120 days.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to settlements on charged off commercial loans of $5.3 million and recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2014 related primarily to $6.1 million of cash collected on certain previously charged-off commercial loans and related judgments which were transferred from BankAtlantic to CAM in connection with the BB&T Transaction, $1.6 million of recoveries from non-accrual loan payoffs, $1.4 million of property tax refunds on a charged off commercial land loan and a $1.9 million recovery from the transfer of a commercial land loan to real estate held-for-investment.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2013 related primarily to the repayment of non-accrual commercial loans including two nonaccrual loans that were previously charged down by $9.5 million and the Catalfumo settlement agreement which resulted in reversals of previously charged-off commercial real estate and commercial non-real estate loans of $10.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Additionally, BBX foreclosed on a residential commercial real estate property resulting in an $11.0 million recovery as the fair value of the collateral based on an updated valuation was greater than the recorded investment in the loan. The remaining recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2013 related primarily to cash collected on certain previously charged-off loans and related judgments and recoveries from foreclosures as the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell was greater than the recorded investment on certain loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of a $1.0 million specific valuation allowances on two commercial non-real estate loans with an aggregate recorded investment of $3.0 million and $1.5 million allowance on consumer loans. The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2014, consisted primarily of consumer second-lien loans greater than 120 days past due and $0.1 million on commercial real estate loans. The majority of BBX's commercial loans receivable were collateral dependent and charged down to the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. There was no allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015 as the consumer second-lien loans greater than 120 days past due were deemed uncollectible and charged-off.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from valuation allowance adjustments of $3.6 million on foreclosed real estate properties to reflect updated valuations partially offset by recoveries of previously written down loans in connection with short sales and payoffs of residential loans held-for-sale.\nAsset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily the result of $8.6 million of impairments on two student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida. The impairments reflected a decline in occupancy rates and rents per unit. The student housing impairments were partially offset by $1.6 million of loans held-for-sale valuation allowance recoveries associated with loan repayments, short sales and updated valuations.\nAsset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of $2.7 million of net impairments on real estate to reflect updated valuations, a $1.6 million increase in the loans held-for-sale valuation allowance and a $0.2 million increase in the provision for tax certificate losses. The real estate impairments were primarily associated with a $2.0 million impairment on an office warehouse property based on an updated valuation. The increase in the valuation allowance for loans held-for-sale resulted from a decline in small business loan valuations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>18,490 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>15,951 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>14,437 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,539 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,514 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOccupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>2,063 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,690 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>252 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>373 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProfessional fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8,331 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>7,578 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>7,172 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>753 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>406 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSEC Civil Penalty\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,550 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,550 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,000 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,964 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>4,396 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>5,518 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,432) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(1,122) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset servicing expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>600 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,763 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>2,765 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,163) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(1,002) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>36,250 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>32,751 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>31,582 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,499 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,169 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nThe increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of higher share based compensation associated with the issuance of restricted stock awards and higher salaries and bonuses. Share based compensation increased $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the granting of 419,492, 396,082 and 430,000 shares of Class A restricted common stock awards in September 2015, October 2014 and October 2013, respectively. The higher salaries and bonuses were mainly due to new hires and annual salary increases.\nOccupancy and Equipment\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of increased rent associated with leasing additional corporate office space.\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 relate primarily to the operations of a public storage rental facility that was acquired through foreclosure in April 2013.\nProfessional Fees\nThe increase in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from higher accounting and consulting fees. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the insurance carrier reimbursed $1.7 million of legal fees in connection with the SEC civil action compared to no reimbursements of legal fees during the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher professional and accounting fees were mainly due to the BFC tender offer and higher audit fees associated with acquired businesses, real estate joint venture investments and the SEC civil action.\nThe increase in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from higher legal and consulting fees associated with the termination of the merger agreement with BFC and the SEC civil action. The SEC civil action trial commenced on November 3, 2014 and lasted six weeks.\nSEC Civil Penalty\nThe SEC civil penalty assessed against BBX Capital in connection with the SEC action was $4.6 million. While the penalty is being appealed, BBX Capital recognized $1.0 million of the civil penalty as an accrual during\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe year ended December 31, 2014 with the balance of the civil penalty of $3.6 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther\nThe decrease in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects $1.1 million of lower foreclosure costs. Foreclosure expenses consisted primarily of real estate taxes on delinquent collateral dependent loans in foreclosure. The decline in foreclosure expenses resulted primarily from a significant decrease in the number of loans in BBX's loan portfolio.\nThe decrease in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower foreclosure expenses. The significant decline in foreclosure expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 reflects $0.8 million of bankruptcy trustee and accounting fees associated with the foreclosure of two related properties during 2013 and a decision to pay delinquent real estate taxes on residential loans during 2013.\nAsset Servicing Expense\nAsset servicing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were fees to third party management companies who service loans and real estate. The significant decline in asset servicing costs reflects loan repayments and sales, real estate liquidations and the renegotiation of the servicing contract at lower rates as well as BBX taking back the servicing of certain commercial loans and real estate from a third party servicer.\nEquity in Earnings of Woodbridge\nBBX recognized equity in earnings of Woodbridge during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $15.0 million, $25.3 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Woodbridge's earnings for year ended December 31, 2015 included a $36.5 million settlement of litigation brought by Bluegreen's former shareholders related to Woodbridge's April 2013 acquisition of Bluegreen as described in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. As BBX has a 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge, the $36.5 million liability reduced BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge by $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Equity in earnings of Woodbridge for the year ended December 31, 2013 were from the date of the investment (April 2, 2013) through December 31, 2013. Woodbridge's earnings consisted primarily of the operations of Bluegreen.\nBluegreen Corporation is a sales, marketing, and management company focused on the vacation ownership industry. Bluegreen Vacations markets, sells and manages vacation ownership interests in resorts, which are generally located in popular, high-volume, drive-to\u201d vacation destinations. The resorts in which Bluegreen Vacations markets, sells or manages VOIs were either developed or acquired by Bluegreen, or were developed and are owned by third parties. Bluegreen Vacations earns fees for providing sales and marketing services to these third party developers. Bluegreen Vacations also earns fees by providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and property owners' associations, mortgage servicing, VOI title services, reservation services, and construction design and development services. In addition, Bluegreen Vacations provides financing to FICO\u00ae score-qualified individual purchasers of VOIs, which generates significant interest income.\nIn addition to Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership operations, Bluegreen has in recent years pursued a business strategy, referred to herein as the capital-light\u201d business strategy, involving activities that typically do not require the significant costs and capital investments generally incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of VOIs under Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen believes its capital-light business strategy enables it to leverage its expertise and existing infrastructure in resort management, sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, title services, and construction management to generate recurring revenues from third parties. Bluegreen's goal is for its capital-light business activities to become an increasing portion of its business over time; however, these efforts may not be successful. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen's capital-light business activities consisted of the following: fee-based sales and marketing arrangements; just-in-time\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninventory acquisition arrangements; secondary market arrangements; and other fee-based services. Each of these categories is described below.\nFee-Based Sales and Marketing Arrangements\nIn 2009, Bluegreen began offering sales and marketing services to third-party developers for a fee. Under these arrangements, Bluegreen sells third-party VOIs as Bluegreen Vacation Club interests through its distribution network of sales offices, typically on a non-committed basis. Bluegreen seeks to structure its fee for these services to cover its selling and marketing costs, plus an operating profit. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects and Bluegreen has little to no capital requirements. Notes receivable originated in connection with Bluegreen's sale of third party VOIs under commission-based arrangements are held by the third party developer, and in certain cases are serviced by Bluegreen for a fee. Bluegreen refers to sales made on behalf of third-party developers as FBS Sales\u201d.\nJust-In-Time Arrangements\nIn 2013, Bluegreen began entering into agreements with third-party developers that allow Bluegreen to buy VOI inventory from time to time in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Bluegreen strives to enter into such arrangements on a non-committed basis, although Bluegreen may engage in committed arrangements under certain circumstances. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects. Unlike FBS Sales, receivables originated in connection with sales of just-in-time inventory are held by Bluegreen. Bluegreen refers to sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements as Just-In-Time Sales\u201d.\nSecondary Market Arrangements\nIn 2012, Bluegreen began a program to acquire VOI inventory from POAs and other third parties on a non-committed basis, in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Such VOIs are typically obtained by the POAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults, and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a significant discount. Bluegreen refers to sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements as Secondary Market Sales\u201d.\nOther Fee-Based Services\nBluegreen also earns fees for providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and to certain POAs. In connection with the management services provided to the Bluegreen Vacation Club, Bluegreen manages the club reservation system and provides owner services as well as billing and collection services. In connection with Bluegreen's management of POAs, Bluegreen provides day-to-day management services, including oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance, and certain accounting and administrative services. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen provided management services to 46 timeshare resort properties and hotels. Other fee-based services also include the processing of sales of VOIs through Bluegreen's wholly-owned title company subsidiary, which earns title fees in connection with the closing of the VOI transactions.\nBluegreen's Operating Results\nBluegreen's net income attributable to Woodbridge was $70.3 million, $57.5 million and $37.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The higher Bluegreen net income in each year during the three year period ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from increased sales of VOIs sold on behalf of third parties on a commission basis and higher commissions earned on these commission based sales. The increase in VOI sales primarily reflected the results of an increased number of tours. Bluegreen's management believes that the increase in tours mainly resulted from efforts to expand marketing initiatives to new sales prospects as well as expanded marketing programs targeting existing owners. The increase in sales was partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses associated with these marketing initiatives. Sales to existing owners\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngenerally involve lower marketing expenses than sales to new prospects. Bluegreen expects to continue to increase its focus on sales to new prospects and, as a result, sales and marketing expenses may continue to increase.\nEquity in Losses of Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures\nBBX recognized equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.6 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are generally real estate joint ventures that develop properties for residential and commercial use. The joint ventures are currently in the entitlement and construction phases and the losses during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 mainly represent marketing and management fees.\nRenin Reportable Segment Results of Operations\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Two\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMonths Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nEnded December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrade sales\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>56,461 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>57,839 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,300 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(42,122) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(43,888) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(7,227) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,339 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,951 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,073 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>308 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>551 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>144 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15,051 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,729 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,515 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBargain purchase gain\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,001) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange loss\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,038 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>715 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>356 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>16,397 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15,995 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,014 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,058) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,044) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(941) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBenefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(2,054) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,050) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(941) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>25.40 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24.12 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.29 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSG&A as a percent of trade sales\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>26.66 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>25.47 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37.80 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTrade sales declined for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period due to the discontinuation by a major customer of the wall d\u00e9cor product partially offset by increased sales of newly designed hardware products.\nThe improvement in the gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31 2015 compared to the same 2014 period reflects increased sales of higher margin hardware products and lower sales of lower margin wall d\u00e9cor products. Also contributing to the improved gross margin percentage was the consolidation of manufacturing facilities during the second half of 2014.\nRenin's interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from the Bluegreen notes payable. Renin refinanced the Bluegreen notes payable with a financial institution in June 2014 under a facility with lower interest rates and outstanding balances. The decline in average notes payable balances was the result of BBX Capital and BFC contributing $2.0 million and $0.5 million of capital, respectively, to repay a portion of the Bluegreen notes payable in connection with the refinancing transaction.\nIncluded in Renin's selling, general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2015 were salaries and recruitment fees associated with the hiring of additional sales representatives and advertising expenditures for sales initiatives as well as consulting expenditures associated with identifying ways to enhance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nproduct development and improve manufacturing efficiencies. Renin's new members of management include its CEO hired in June 2015 and a Vice President of Sales hired in September 2015. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was severance associated with the reorganization of Renin's marketing and corporate personnel.\nIncluded in Renin's selling, general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.9 million of costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in Canada. Renin also incurred $0.1 million of acquisition related expenses and $0.2 million of process improvement professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe loss on foreign currency exchange for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 resulted from the decrease in value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate declined from 94.02 as of December 31, 2013 to 86.2 as of December 31, 2014 to 72.09 at December 31, 2015.\nRenin's trade sales and gross margin as a percent of trade sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were consistent with prior quarters during 2014. The improvement in the gross margin from 22.29% during the two months end December 31, 2013 to 24.12% during the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects the consolidation of the Concord manufacturing facility into the Brampton facility and higher average trade sales volume during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the two months ended December 31, 2013.\nRenin's interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $0.3 million of interest expense associated with the Bluegreen notes payable. Renin refinanced the Bluegreen notes payable with a financial institution in June 2014 at lower interest rates and outstanding balances.\nIncluded in selling, general and administrative expenses during the two months ended December 31, 2013 were $1.0 million of acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the Renin acquisition.\nSweet Holdings Reportable Segment Results of Operations\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the One\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMonth Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nEnded December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrade sales\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,837 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>16,257 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>966 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(20,585) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(10,794) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(633) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,252 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,463 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>333 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>949 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>440 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBargain purchase gain\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(254) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,237) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15,324 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,237 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>347 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>16,019 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,440 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>371 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(8,767) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(38) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBenefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(329) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3,107) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(8,438) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,130 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(38) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>26.05 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>33.60 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34.47 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSG&A as a percent of trade sales\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>55.05 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>38.37 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>35.92 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Sweet Holdings results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of the activities of Hoffman's, Williams & Bennett, Helen Grace Chocolates, Jer's Chocolates and Anastasia Confections for the entire year and the operations of Kencraft for the nine months ended December 31, 2015.\nSweet Holdings results of operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the activities of Hoffman's and Williams and Bennett for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the activities of Jer's, Helen Grace and Anastasia from their respective dates of acquisition, July 1, 2014, July 21, 2014 and October 1, 2014.\nSweet Holdings results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the activities of Hoffman's for the month of December 2013.\nThe lower gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a higher percent of wholesale trade sales compared to retail trade sales and secondarily from approximately $725,000 of inventory markdowns related to Helen Grace and Williams & Bennett obsolete inventory. The majority of Sweet Holdings acquisitions subsequent to September 30, 2014 were acquisitions of manufacturers selling to wholesale customers. Trade sales to wholesale customers typically have lower gross margins than trade sales to retail customers.\nThe increase in interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from additional borrowings for working capital lines-of-credit and acquisition promissory notes.\nThe bargain purchase gain for the year ended December 31, 2015 was associated with the Kencraft acquisition and the bargain purchase gain for the year ended December 31, 2014 was associated with the Helen Grace acquisition. The bargain purchase gain represents the amount by which the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeded the purchase consideration. Management believes that it was able to acquire Kencraft and Helen Grace for bargain purchase gains because Kencraft and Helen Grace were distressed companies.\nThe higher selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects operating expenses associated with companies acquired and costs to integrate these companies as well as increased compensation expense related to the hiring of industry professionals and fees to consultants. Executives hired during the first quarter of 2015 included a President for BBX Sweet Holdings and a President for Hoffman's. Also contributing to higher selling, general and administrative expenses were costs associated with relocating the Helen Grace California manufacturing facilities to Kencraft's manufacturing facilities in Utah and costs associated with Hoffman's retail store expansion initiatives. Hoffman's opened one retail location during the third quarter of 2014 as well as three retail locations during the year ended December 31, 2015 and anticipates opening additional retail locations in 2016. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.3 million of employee severance expenses and costs to relocate the Helen Grace manufacturing facilities to Utah.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBBX Capital Corporation Consolidated Financial Condition\nBBX Capital's total assets as of December 31, 2015 were $393.5 million compared to $392.9 million as of December 31, 2014.

This does not include $18.0 million of current assets held in Renin. BBX Capital had $19.8 million of current liabilities as of December 31, 2015. This does not include $7.5 million of current liabilities of Renin. BBX Capital's principal sources of liquidity are its cash holdings, funds obtained from scheduled\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npayments on loans, loan recoveries, sales of its loans, loan payoffs, sales of real estate, income from income producing real estate, revenues from BBX Sweet Holdings' operations and distributions received from Woodbridge. Management believes that BBX Capital has sufficient liquidity to fund future operations.\nBluegreen's former public shareholders brought an action against Bluegreen, the directors of Bluegreen, BFC, Woodbridge, certain directors and officers of BFC and others, challenging the terms of the merger pursuant to which Bluegreen merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodbridge and Bluegreen's shareholders (other than Woodbridge) were paid $10.00 in cash for each share of Bluegreen's common stock that they held immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and on June 5, 2015 the plaintiffs and defendants agreed to a settlement of the litigation. Pursuant to the settlement, Woodbridge paid $36.5 million, which amounts to approximately $2.50 per share, into a settlement fund for the benefit of former shareholders of Bluegreen whose shares were acquired in connection with the merger. The amount to be received by such former Bluegreen shareholders will be reduced by administrative costs and attorneys' fees and costs. In connection with the settlement, BBX Capital repaid its $11.75 million promissory note to Woodbridge and BBX Capital and BFC made additional capital contributions to Woodbridge of $11.4 million and $13.4 million, respectively, based on their respective 46% and 54% ownership interests in Woodbridge.\nBBX Capital expects that it will receive dividends from time to time from its 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge. Distributions must be declared by Woodbridge and approved in advance by both BFC and BBX Capital. Dividends from Woodbridge will be dependent on and subject to Bluegreen's results of operations, cash flows and business of Bluegreen, as well as restrictions contained in Bluegreen's debt facilities. Additionally, in April 2015, BFC borrowed $80 million from Bluegreen to finance the purchase of 4,771,221 shares of BBX Capital's Class A common stock in BFC's completed tender offer. As a consequence, BBX Capital may not receive dividends from Woodbridge consistent with prior periods or in the time frames or amounts anticipated, or at all. BBX Capital may also receive funds from BFC in connection with its tax sharing agreement to the extent BFC utilizes BBX Capital's tax benefits in BFC's consolidated tax return. BBX Capital also expects to obtain funds in subsequent periods from cash flows on its loans, real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. BBX Capital also may seek to obtain funds through borrowings or the issuance of equity securities. BBX Capital anticipates utilizing these funds for general corporate purposes, including selling, general and administrative expenses, loan servicing costs, real estate operating expenses, Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings operating expenses and, to the extent of available liquidity, to pursue its business strategy of investing, directly or through joint ventures, in real estate (which may include the acquisition and/or development of real estate) and operating businesses. BBX Sweet Holdings currently intends to continue to pursue acquisitions in the candy and confections industry.\nA significant source of BBX Capital's liquidity is proceeds from the liquidation of loans and real estate, recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio, cash proceeds from the contribution of properties to real estate joint ventures and dividends from Woodbridge. During the year ended December 31, 2015, proceeds from principal repayments of loans and sales of real estate were approximately $30.2 million and $72.2 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, BBX Capital received $23.8 million of dividends from Woodbridge. There is no assurance that BBX Capital will realize proceeds from these sources in future periods in similar amounts or on similar timeframes.\nBBX Capital's real estate activities include hiring property managers to operate income producing properties, making protective expenditures (including the payment of property taxes) in an effort to maintain the value of properties and undertaking the zoning and entitlement, development or improvement of properties to position the properties for sale or potential joint venture arrangements. There is no assurance that BBX Capital will realize proceeds from these sources in future periods in similar amounts or on similar timeframes.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNotes payable as of December 31, 2015 consisted of a term loan and revolving credit advances issued by Renin with an aggregate balance of $8.1 million, $6.7 million of promissory notes and holdback amounts owed by BBX Sweet Holdings in connection with its acquisitions, $5.0 million revolving line of credit to BBX Sweet Holdings and a $1.6 million note payable issued by a subsidiary of BBX Sweet Holdings.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including the valuation of collateral dependent loans, the valuation of loans held-for-sale, the impairment of long-lived assets including amortizable intangible assets, real estate held-for-sale and held-for-investment, the determination of lower of cost or market for inventories, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business, the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting for uncertain tax positions and accounting for contingencies. The three accounting policies that BBX Capital has identified as critical accounting policies are allowance for loan losses, inventory reserves and impairment of long-lived assets. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPolicies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, for a detailed discussion of BBX Capital's significant accounting policies.\nAllowance for loan losses, valuation of collateral dependent loans and loans-held-for-sale\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount that is believed by its management to be a reasonable estimate of probable losses inherent in BBX Capital's loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements presented. BBX Capital has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the allowance for loan losses which considers all available information. However, BBX Capital relies on estimates and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown. As a consequence, if circumstances differ from BBX Capital's estimates and judgments, the allowance for loan losses may decrease or increase significantly and the amount of losses actually realized in BBX Capital's loan portfolio could be significantly higher or lower. There was no allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015. BBX Capital's loans receivable as of December 31, 2015 was $34.0 million and were primarily collateralized by real estate. Declines in real estate market condition in geographical areas where BBX Capital's collateral is located may result in material changes to BBX Capital's allowance for loan losses.\nIn June 2015, BBX Capital transferred its small business, residential and second-lien consumer loans from loans held-for-sale to loans receivable measured at the lower of cost or fair value at the transfer date. The difference between the carrying amount of the loans and the fair value was recognized as a discount. The discount on the transferred loans was greater than the calculated allowance for loan loss. As a consequence there was no allowance for loan losses assigned to these loans as of December 31, 2015.\nCommercial loans were evaluated individually and were either written down to the fair value of the collateral or based on the primary source of repayment and pier group analysis management determined no allowance for loan losses should be assigned to the commercial loan portfolio.\nValuation allowances or charge downs on collateral dependent loans and the fair value of loans held-for-sale are established using management estimates of the fair value of collateral or based on valuation models that present value estimated expected future cash flows. The outstanding balance of collateral dependent loans and loans held-for-sale was $9.6 million and $21.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.\nThese valuations are based on available information and require estimates and subjective judgments about fair values of the collateral or expected future cash flows. Most of BBX Capital's loans do not have an observable market price, and an estimate of the collection of contractual cash flows is based on the judgment of management. BBX Capital generally utilizes broker price opinions and third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value of collateral. The appraisers or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral. It is likely that the results would materially differ if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. As a consequence of the estimates and assumptions required to calculate the valuation allowance, charge downs on collateral dependent loans or the fair value of loans held-for-sale, a change in these highly uncertain estimates could have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on BBX Capital's financial condition and results of operations.\nBBX Capital analyzes its loan portfolio quarterly by monitoring credit quality, loan-to-value ratios, delinquency trends, collateral valuations and economic conditions. As a consequence, BBX Capital's allowance for loan losses and fair value estimates will change from period to period. BBX Capital believes that its performance in subsequent periods will be highly sensitive to changes in the Florida real estate market and availability of mortgage financing in Florida. If real estate and economic conditions deteriorate, BBX Capital is likely to experience increased credit losses and valuation allowance adjustments.\nInventory lower of cost or market\nInventories consisted of $8.4 million at Renin and $7.9 million at BBX Sweet Holdings as of December 31, 2015. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Fluctuations in the market price of raw materials and labor costs may affect the value of inventory and may have a favorable or unfavorable effect on\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncosts of goods sold and gross margin. For the Renin inventory, when expected market sales prices move below costs, or when BBX Capital identifies slow moving or obsolete inventory, BBX Capital records adjustments to write down the carrying values of inventories. Renin recognized $0.1 million of inventory adjustment write downs during the year ended December 31, 2015. BBX Sweet Holdings evaluates its inventory periodically and recognized $1.7 million of inventory adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2015. Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings maintain inventories of bulk raw materials and included in BBX Sweet Holdings inventory was paper goods and packaging material. For Renin, quantities were determined based upon its inventory systems and are subject to periodic verification techniques including observation, weighing and other methods. For BBX Sweet Holdings inventory quantities were determined by period-end observation and weighing. The quantities and costs are generally subject to change in estimates based on market sales prices and general economic conditions in the industry. As a consequence, if raw material or labor costs increase or if market sales prices decline, BBX Capital will likely experience higher amounts of obsolete inventory, higher inventory reserves with a corresponding increase cost of goods sold and lower gross margins.\nImpairment of long lived assets including amortizable intangible assets\nLong-lived assets such as properties and equipment, amortizable intangible assets and real estate held-for-investment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When testing a long-lived asset for recoverability, it may be necessary to review estimated lives and adjust the depreciation or amortization period. Changes in circumstances and the estimates of future cash flows, as well as evaluating estimated lives of long-lived assets, are subjective and involve a significant amount of judgment. A change in the estimated life of a long-lived asset may substantially change depreciation and amortization expense in subsequent periods.\nReal estate held-for-sale is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Fair values are not available for many of BBX Capital's long-lived assets, and estimates must be based on available information, including prices of similar assets and present value valuation techniques.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, BBX Capital recognized impairments on real estate of $3.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively. BBX Capital generally utilizes broker price opinions and third party appraisals to assist in determining the fair value of real estate. The appraisers or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the properties and BBX Capital may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the valuation date when current appraisals are not available.\nThe assumptions used to calculate the fair values are highly subjective and extremely sensitive to changes in market conditions. The assumptions used are representative of assumptions that BBX Capital believes market participants would use in fair valuing these assets, but different assumptions may result in significantly different results. BBX Capital validates assumptions by comparing completed transactions with prior period fair value estimates and BBX Capital may check its assumptions against multiple valuation sources.\nThe outstanding balance of real estate held-for-sale, real estate held-for-investment, amortizable intangible assets and properties and equipment was $46.3 million, $31.3 million, $8.2 million and $18.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The amount ultimately realized upon the sale or operation of these properties may be significantly different than the recorded amounts. Future events, including volatility in real estate values, may result in additional impairments or recoveries of long-lived assets in the foreseeable future.\nDividends\nBBX Capital has historically not paid dividends. While BBX Capital currently expects to continue to utilize its available cash to pursue opportunities in accordance with its business strategies, it may consider the payment of dividends in the future depending upon its results of operations, liquidity needs and other factors considered by its board of directors.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpact of Inflation\nThe financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nBBX Capital Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Florida in 1994. BBX Capital Corporation's principal asset until July 31, 2012 was its ownership of BankAtlantic and its subsidiaries. BankAtlantic was a federal savings bank headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and provided traditional retail banking services and a wide range of commercial banking products and related financial services through a broad network of community branches located in Florida. On July 31, 2012, BBX Capital completed the sale to BB&T of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of BankAtlantic (the BB&T Transaction\u201d).\nBBX Capital's activities subsequent to the consummation of the BB&T Transaction involve the ownership, acquisition, investment and management of real estate and real estate development projects as well as its investments in operating businesses.\nBBX Capital's investments in real estate joint ventures generally were arrangements with developers for residential and commercial development projects in which BBX Capital has funded its equity investment in joint ventures through cash investments or by contributing real estate properties.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nBBX Capital reports its consolidated results of operations in three reportable segments, BBX, Renin and Sweet Holdings.\nIncome (loss) from each of BBX Capital's reportable segments was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBBX\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>33,334 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>3,224 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>48,659 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRenin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,058) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(2,044) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(941) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSweet Holdings\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(8,767) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>23 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(38) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReconciling item (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>773 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23,282 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,203 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>47,680 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(245) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(3,101) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>20 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>23,527 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>4,304 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>47,660 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents capitalized interest on real estate development and joint venture activities in excess of interest expense incurred in the BBX reportable segment. \nOverview\nBBX Reportable Segment\nThe increase in BBX reportable segment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from a $25.6 million increase in net gains on the sales of assets, $6.3 million of higher recoveries from loan losses and a $6.7 million reduction in asset impairments. The above improvements in BBX reportable segment income were partially offset by $10.3 million of lower equity in earnings from BBX Capital's investment in Woodbridge.\nGains on sales of assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $31.1 million compared to $5.5 million during the comparable 2014 period. The gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2015 resulted primarily from the sales of four properties. Two of the properties were located in West Palm Beach, Florida, a third property was located in the Bonterra master-planned community and the fourth property was acquired through a loan participation and sold by the lead bank. BBX recognized aggregate gains of $31.4 million in connection with sales of these four properties.\nRecoveries for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $13.5 million compared to $7.2 million during the comparable 2014 period. The improvement in recoveries during 2015 was mainly due to lower charge-offs and higher recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015 charge-offs were $1.0 million compared to $7.2 million during the same 2014 period.\nThe lower asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from $8.6 million of impairments on two student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a $1.8 million additional impairment on one of the student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe $10.3 million decline in the equity in earnings of Woodbridge resulted primarily from Woodbridge's $36.5 million settlement of litigation brought by Bluegreen's former shareholders related to Woodbridge's April 2013 acquisition of Bluegreen as described in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. As BBX has a 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge, the $36.5 million settlement reduced BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge by $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The reduction in BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge as a consequence of the litigation settlement was partially offset by improved earnings at Bluegreen. Bluegreen's net income attributable to shareholder was $68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $54.5 million during the comparable 2014 period.\nThe decline in BBX reportable segment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same 2013 period resulted primarily from $36.7 million of lower recoveries from loan losses and a $18.9 million decline in interest income recoveries associated with the repayment of non-accrual loans. The above declines in BBX reportable segment income were partially offset by $11.8 million of higher equity earnings from BBX Capital's investment in Woodbridge and lower interest expense associated with BB&T's preferred interest in FAR.\nRecoveries from loan losses and interest income recognized on non-accrual loans were $7.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $43.9 million and $24.3 million during the same 2013 period, respectively. The significant loan loss recoveries and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from a settlement with a borrower which resulted in reversals of previously charged-off commercial loans of $20.1 million and interest income recoveries of $13.6 million.\nBBX Capital's equity in earnings of Woodbridge was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $13.5 million during the same 2013 period. Equity in earnings of Woodbridge for the year ended December 31, 2013 were from the date of the investment (April 2, 2013) through December 31, 2013.\nRenin Reportable Segment\nRenin's reportable segment loss during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from $1.0 million of foreign exchange losses and expenses associated with the hiring of additional sales representatives and advertising expenditures for sales initiatives during 2015 as well as consulting expenditures to achieve product development and manufacturing efficiencies. Renin's new members of management include its CEO hired in June 2015 and a Vice President of Sales hired in September 2015. Renin incurred severance costs associated with the reorganization of its marketing and corporate personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015. Renin improved its gross margin and gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period as a greater proportion of Renin's trade sales were higher margin hardware products. Renin's interest expense was lower during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period as Renin refinanced its notes payable in June 2014 at lower interest rates.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRenin's reportable segment loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from a $0.7 million loss on foreign currency exchange and $0.9 million of costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in Canada.\nRenin's reportable segment loss for the two months ended December 31, 2013 included $1.0 million of acquisition related costs offset by a $1.0 million bargain purchase gain. Management believes that it was able to acquire Renin for a bargain purchase gain because Renin Corp. was a distressed company.\nSweet Holdings Reportable Segment\nThe higher Sweet Holdings reportable segment loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, inventory markdowns as well as lower acquisition bargain purchase gains partially offset by an increase in trade sales associated with acquired companies.\nThe higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects operating expenses associated with companies acquired and costs to integrate these companies as well as increased compensation expense related to the hiring of industry professionals and fees to consultants. Executives hired during the first quarter of 2015 included a President for BBX Sweet Holdings and a President for Hoffman's. Also contributing to higher selling, general and administrative expenses were costs associated with relocating the Helen Grace California manufacturing facilities to Kencraft's manufacturing facilities in Utah and costs associated with Hoffman's retail store expansion initiatives. Hoffman's opened one retail location during the third quarter of 2014 as well as three retail locations during the year ended December 31, 2015 and anticipates opening additional retail locations in 2016. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.3 million of employee severance expenses and costs to relocate the Helen Grace manufacturing facilities to Utah.\nThe gross margin was adversely affected for the year ended December 31, 2015 by $600,000 of inventory markdowns and the relocation of Helen Grace's manufacturing facilities from California to Utah in September 2015.\nThe bargain purchase gain of $254,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 was associated with the Kencraft acquisition and the bargain purchase gain of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was associated with the Helen Grace acquisition.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe benefit for income taxes of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from acquisition re-measurement adjustments and a reduction in BBX Capital's deferred tax valuation allowance as a result of net taxable temporary differences that Sweet Holdings

December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects higher interest income recognized on a cash basis from the payoffs of nonaccrual loans partially offset by lower interest income recognized on accruing loans associated with declining accruing loan balances due primarily to loan repayments and loan sales. Accruing loan balances declined from $23.0 million as of December 31, 2013 to $6.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, $5.8 million of interest income was recognized on the payoff of two commercial loans.\nThe decline in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower interest income recognized on a cash basis from the settlement of non-accrual loans and secondarily from lower interest income recognized on accruing loans due primarily to lower accruing loan balances.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, $13.6 million of interest income was recovered in connection with the repayment of non-accrual loans pursuant to a settlement agreement with respect to litigation between CAM and Daniel S. Catalfumo and certain members of his family and affiliated entities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNet Gains on the Sales of Assets\nThe net gains on the sales of assets during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were primarily gains on the sales of real estate properties.\nGains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the sales of four properties. Two of the properties were located in West Palm Beach, Florida. One of the properties, which was purchased by the JRG/BBX Development joint venture for $10.8 million, was sold to a third party developer for $20.0 million. A second property, which had a $3.2 million carrying value at the date of sale, was acquired by BBX through foreclosure and sold for $11.0 million. A third property was located in the Bonterra master-planned community in Hialeah, Florida, had a carrying value of $13.9 million and sold for $26.2 million. The fourth property was acquired through foreclosure in Las Vegas, Nevada, had a carrying value of $2.6 million and sold for $6.0 million. BBX recognized gains of $31.4 million in the aggregate in connection with these four property sales.\nIncluded in net gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2014 was a $2.5 million gain on the sale of one property, the sale of first lien consumer and residential loans for a $0.6 million gain and gains of $1.3 million on the sales of various real estate properties.\nIncluded in net gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2013 was a $1.5 million gain from the sale of rental property, $0.9 million of gains associated with the sale of tax certificates, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a storage facility and a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale commercial real estate loan.\nIncome from Real Estate Operations\nIncome from real estate operations consists of rental income from foreclosed properties.\nThe lower income from real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from the sales of rental properties and one operating property during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe increase in income from real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same 2013 period reflects an increase in the number of income producing foreclosed properties which resulted in higher rental income during 2014 compared to 2013. The additional foreclosed properties included two student housing facilities that BBX acquired through settlements with borrowers in September 2013 and January 2014.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted mainly of $1.5 million of rental income from a public storage operating facility that was acquired through foreclosure in April 2013, $0.4 million of office facilities revenues paid by BFC for use of its office space and $0.4 million of management fees recognized from Sweet Holdings. The Sweet Holdings management fees were eliminated in consolidation.\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted mainly of $1.2 million of rental income associated with a public storage operating facility, $0.6 million of income associated with a foreclosed loan, $0.4 million of office facilities revenues from BFC and $0.2 million of management fees from Sweet Holdings.\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted mainly of $0.7 million of rental income associated with the public storage operating facility, $0.9 million of income associated with a foreclosed loan, $0.7 million of recoveries on loans in excess of contractual principal, $0.2 million of deposit overdraft recoveries associated with the charged off deposit overdraft portfolio retained in the BB&T Transaction and $0.4 million of office facilities revenues from BFC.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBB&Ts Priority Return in FAR Distributions\nBB&T's priority return in FAR distributions during the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 represented the priority return paid to BB&T pursuant to its preferred membership interests in FAR. The required priority return was set at LIBOR + 200 basis points per annum on the unpaid preferred membership interest preference amount. The preferred membership interest preference amount was reduced from $196.9 million as of December 31, 2012 to $72.1 million as of December 31, 2013 to $12.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and was paid in full in May 2015. FAR utilized cash receipts primarily from loan repayments and the sales of assets to repay the preference amount and fund the priority return.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 $0.4 million of BBX reportable segment interest expense was capitalized in connection with real estate development and joint venture activities. The capitalized interest expense for year ended December 31, 2015 was incurred in connection with the Woodbridge promissory note. The Woodbridge promissory note was repaid in full during September 2015.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from $0.6 million of interest expense recognized on the Woodbridge promissory note and $0.2 million of interest expense recognized on the Florida Community Bank mortgage. The $8.3 million Florida Community Bank mortgage was assumed by the Hialeah Communities joint venture in June 2014.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted from two notes payable aggregating $10.3 million issued as of December 31, 2012. The notes were issued to two third party participants in loans for which BBX Capital was the lead lender in connection with BBX Capital's acquisition of the participants' interest in a loan and certain real estate property. One note payable in the amount of $2.5 million was repaid in December 2013.\nReal Estate Operating Expenses\nReal estate operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 represent real estate holding costs, including taxes and insurance, associated with real estate acquired through foreclosure.\nThe decline in real estate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the sale of properties and the transfer of properties to real estate joint ventures.\nThe increase in real estate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from loan foreclosures.\nRecoveries from Loan Losses\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for Loan Losses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>977 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>2,713 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>5,311 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCharge-offs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,037) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(7,189) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(10,867) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecoveries\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,517 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>12,608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>52,134 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecoveries from loan losses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(13,457) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(7,155) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(43,865) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance, end of period\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>977 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>2,713 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were mainly second-lien consumer loans.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLoan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of a charge-off of a $1.9 million commercial non-mortgage business loan, $2.7 million of charge-offs associated with the transfer of performing second lien consumer loans to loans held-for-sale and $0.7 million of charge-offs due to initial charge downs on loans past due greater than 120 days and first lien foreclosures. The remaining charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2014 related primarily to updated valuations on collateral dependent loans.\nLoan charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of consumer and residential loan charge-offs of $3.3 million and charge-offs of $0.7 million upon the transfer of the loans to loans held-for-sale. The remaining charge-offs reflect updated valuations on non-accrual loans and initial charge downs on loans past due greater than 120 days.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to settlements on charged off commercial loans of $5.3 million and recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2014 related primarily to $6.1 million of cash collected on certain previously charged-off commercial loans and related judgments which were transferred from BankAtlantic to CAM in connection with the BB&T Transaction, $1.6 million of recoveries from non-accrual loan payoffs, $1.4 million of property tax refunds on a charged off commercial land loan and a $1.9 million recovery from the transfer of a commercial land loan to real estate held-for-investment.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2013 related primarily to the repayment of non-accrual commercial loans including two nonaccrual loans that were previously charged down by $9.5 million and the Catalfumo settlement agreement which resulted in reversals of previously charged-off commercial real estate and commercial non-real estate loans of $10.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Additionally, BBX foreclosed on a residential commercial real estate property resulting in an $11.0 million recovery as the fair value of the collateral based on an updated valuation was greater than the recorded investment in the loan. The remaining recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2013 related primarily to cash collected on certain previously charged-off loans and related judgments and recoveries from foreclosures as the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell was greater than the recorded investment on certain loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of a $1.0 million specific valuation allowances on two commercial non-real estate loans with an aggregate recorded investment of $3.0 million and $1.5 million allowance on consumer loans. The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2014, consisted primarily of consumer second-lien loans greater than 120 days past due and $0.1 million on commercial real estate loans. The majority of BBX's commercial loans receivable were collateral dependent and charged down to the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. There was no allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015 as the consumer second-lien loans greater than 120 days past due were deemed uncollectible and charged-off.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from valuation allowance adjustments of $3.6 million on foreclosed real estate properties to reflect updated valuations partially offset by recoveries of previously written down loans in connection with short sales and payoffs of residential loans held-for-sale.\nAsset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily the result of $8.6 million of impairments on two student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida. The impairments reflected a decline in occupancy rates and rents per unit. The student housing impairments were partially offset by $1.6 million of loans held-for-sale valuation allowance recoveries associated with loan repayments, short sales and updated valuations.\nAsset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of $2.7 million of net impairments on real estate to reflect updated valuations, a $1.6 million increase in the loans held-for-sale valuation allowance and a $0.2 million increase in the provision for tax certificate losses. The real estate impairments were primarily associated with a $2.0 million impairment on an office warehouse property based on an updated valuation. The increase in the valuation allowance for loans held-for-sale resulted from a decline in small business loan valuations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>18,490 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>15,951 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>14,437 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,539 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,514 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOccupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,315 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>2,063 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,690 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>252 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>373 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProfessional fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8,331 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>7,578 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>7,172 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>753 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>406 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSEC Civil Penalty\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,550 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,550 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,000 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,964 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>4,396 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>5,518 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,432) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(1,122) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset servicing expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>600 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,763 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>2,765 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,163) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>(1,002) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>36,250 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>32,751 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>31,582 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,499 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>1,169 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nThe increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of higher share based compensation associated with the issuance of restricted stock awards and higher salaries and bonuses. Share based compensation increased $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the granting of 419,492, 396,082 and 430,000 shares of Class A restricted common stock awards in September 2015, October 2014 and October 2013, respectively. The higher salaries and bonuses were mainly due to new hires and annual salary increases.\nOccupancy and Equipment\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of increased rent associated with leasing additional corporate office space.\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 relate primarily to the operations of a public storage rental facility that was acquired through foreclosure in April 2013.\nProfessional Fees\nThe increase in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from higher accounting and consulting fees. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the insurance carrier reimbursed $1.7 million of legal fees in connection with the SEC civil action compared to no reimbursements of legal fees during the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher professional and accounting fees were mainly due to the BFC tender offer and higher audit fees associated with acquired businesses, real estate joint venture investments and the SEC civil action.\nThe increase in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from higher legal and consulting fees associated with the termination of the merger agreement with BFC and the SEC civil action. The SEC civil action trial commenced on November 3, 2014 and lasted six weeks.\nSEC Civil Penalty\nThe SEC civil penalty assessed against BBX Capital in connection with the SEC action was $4.6 million. While the penalty is being appealed, BBX Capital recognized $1.0 million of the civil penalty as an accrual during\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe year ended December 31, 2014 with the balance of the civil penalty of $3.6 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther\nThe decrease in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects $1.1 million of lower foreclosure costs. Foreclosure expenses consisted primarily of real estate taxes on delinquent collateral dependent loans in foreclosure. The decline in foreclosure expenses resulted primarily from a significant decrease in the number of loans in BBX's loan portfolio.\nThe decrease in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower foreclosure expenses. The significant decline in foreclosure expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 reflects $0.8 million of bankruptcy trustee and accounting fees associated with the foreclosure of two related properties during 2013 and a decision to pay delinquent real estate taxes on residential loans during 2013.\nAsset Servicing Expense\nAsset servicing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were fees to third party management companies who service loans and real estate. The significant decline in asset servicing costs reflects loan repayments and sales, real estate liquidations and the renegotiation of the servicing contract at lower rates as well as BBX taking back the servicing of certain commercial loans and real estate from a third party servicer.\nEquity in Earnings of Woodbridge\nBBX recognized equity in earnings of Woodbridge during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $15.0 million, $25.3 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Woodbridge's earnings for year ended December 31, 2015 included a $36.5 million settlement of litigation brought by Bluegreen's former shareholders related to Woodbridge's April 2013 acquisition of Bluegreen as described in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. As BBX has a 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge, the $36.5 million liability reduced BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge by $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Equity in earnings of Woodbridge for the year ended December 31, 2013 were from the date of the investment (April 2, 2013) through December 31, 2013. Woodbridge's earnings consisted primarily of the operations of Bluegreen.\nBluegreen Corporation is a sales, marketing, and management company focused on the vacation ownership industry. Bluegreen Vacations markets, sells and manages vacation ownership interests in resorts, which are generally located in popular, high-volume, drive-to\u201d vacation destinations. The resorts in which Bluegreen Vacations markets, sells or manages VOIs were either developed or acquired by Bluegreen, or were developed and are owned by third parties. Bluegreen Vacations earns fees for providing sales and marketing services to these third party developers. Bluegreen Vacations also earns fees by providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and property owners' associations, mortgage servicing, VOI title services, reservation services, and construction design and development services. In addition, Bluegreen Vacations provides financing to FICO\u00ae score-qualified individual purchasers of VOIs, which generates significant interest income.\nIn addition to Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership operations, Bluegreen has in recent years pursued a business strategy, referred to herein as the capital-light\u201d business strategy, involving activities that typically do not require the significant costs and capital investments generally incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of VOIs under Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen believes its capital-light business strategy enables it to leverage its expertise and existing infrastructure in resort management, sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, title services, and construction management to generate recurring revenues from third parties. Bluegreen's goal is for its capital-light business activities to become an increasing portion of its business over time; however, these efforts may not be successful. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen's capital-light business activities consisted of the following: fee-based sales and marketing arrangements; just-in-time\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninventory acquisition arrangements; secondary market arrangements; and other fee-based services. Each of these categories is described below.\nFee-Based Sales and Marketing Arrangements\nIn 2009, Bluegreen began offering sales and marketing services to third-party developers for a fee. Under these arrangements, Bluegreen sells third-party VOIs as Bluegreen Vacation Club interests through its distribution network of sales offices, typically on a non-committed basis. Bluegreen seeks to structure its fee for these services to cover its selling and marketing costs, plus an operating profit. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects and Bluegreen has little to no capital requirements. Notes receivable originated in connection with Bluegreen's sale of third party VOIs under commission-based arrangements are held by the third party developer, and in certain cases are serviced by Bluegreen for a fee. Bluegreen refers to sales made on behalf of third-party developers as FBS Sales\u201d.\nJust-In-Time Arrangements\nIn 2013, Bluegreen began entering into agreements with third-party developers that allow Bluegreen to buy VOI inventory from time to time in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Bluegreen strives to enter into such arrangements on a non-committed basis, although Bluegreen may engage in committed arrangements under certain circumstances. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects. Unlike FBS Sales, receivables originated in connection with sales of just-in-time inventory are held by Bluegreen. Bluegreen refers to sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements as Just-In-Time Sales\u201d.\nSecondary Market Arrangements\nIn 2012, Bluegreen began a program to acquire VOI inventory from POAs and other third parties on a non-committed basis, in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Such VOIs are typically obtained by the POAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults, and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a significant discount. Bluegreen refers to sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements as Secondary Market Sales\u201d.\nOther Fee-Based Services\nBluegreen also earns fees for providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and to certain POAs. In connection with the management services provided to the Bluegreen Vacation Club, Bluegreen manages the club reservation system and provides owner services as well as billing and collection services. In connection with Bluegreen's management of POAs, Bluegreen provides day-to-day management services, including oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance, and certain accounting and administrative services. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen provided management services to 46 timeshare resort properties and hotels. Other fee-based services also include the processing of sales of VOIs through Bluegreen's wholly-owned title company subsidiary, which earns title fees in connection with the closing of the VOI transactions.\nBluegreen's Operating Results\nBluegreen's net income attributable to Woodbridge was $70.3 million, $57.5 million and $37.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The higher Bluegreen net income in each year during the three year period ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from increased sales of VOIs sold on behalf of third parties on a commission basis and higher commissions earned on these commission based sales. The increase in VOI sales primarily reflected the results of an increased number of tours. Bluegreen's management believes that the increase in tours mainly resulted from efforts to expand marketing initiatives to new sales prospects as well as expanded marketing programs targeting existing owners. The increase in sales was partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses associated with these marketing initiatives. Sales to existing owners\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngenerally involve lower marketing expenses than sales to new prospects. Bluegreen expects to continue to increase its focus on sales to new prospects and, as a result, sales and marketing expenses may continue to increase.\nEquity in Losses of Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures\nBBX recognized equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.6 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are generally real estate joint ventures that develop properties for residential and commercial use. The joint ventures are currently in the entitlement and construction phases and the losses during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 mainly represent marketing and management fees.\nRenin Reportable Segment Results of Operations\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Two\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMonths Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nEnded December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrade sales\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>56,461 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>57,839 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,300 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(42,122) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(43,888) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(7,227) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,339 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,951 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,073 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>308 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>551 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>144 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15,051 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,729 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,515 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBargain purchase gain\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,001) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange loss\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,038 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>715 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>356 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>16,397 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15,995 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,014 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,058) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,044) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(941) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBenefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(2,054) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,050) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(941) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>25.40 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24.12 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.29 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSG&A as a percent of trade sales\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>26.66 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>25.47 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>37.80 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTrade sales declined for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period due to the discontinuation by a major customer of the wall d\u00e9cor product partially offset by increased sales of newly designed hardware products.\nThe improvement in the gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31 2015 compared to the same 2014 period reflects increased sales of higher margin hardware products and lower sales of lower margin wall d\u00e9cor products. Also contributing to the improved gross margin percentage was the consolidation of manufacturing facilities during the second half of 2014.\nRenin's interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from the Bluegreen notes payable. Renin refinanced the Bluegreen notes payable with a financial institution in June 2014 under a facility with lower interest rates and outstanding balances. The decline in average notes payable balances was the result of BBX Capital and BFC contributing $2.0 million and $0.5 million of capital, respectively, to repay a portion of the Bluegreen notes payable in connection with the refinancing transaction.\nIncluded in Renin's selling, general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2015 were salaries and recruitment fees associated with the hiring of additional sales representatives and advertising expenditures for sales initiatives as well as consulting expenditures associated with identifying ways to enhance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nproduct development and improve manufacturing efficiencies. Renin's new members of management include its CEO hired in June 2015 and a Vice President of Sales hired in September 2015. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was severance associated with the reorganization of Renin's marketing and corporate personnel.\nIncluded in Renin's selling, general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.9 million of costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in Canada. Renin also incurred $0.1 million of acquisition related expenses and $0.2 million of process improvement professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe loss on foreign currency exchange for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 resulted from the decrease in value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate declined from 94.02 as of December 31, 2013 to 86.2 as of December 31, 2014 to 72.09 at December 31, 2015.\nRenin's trade sales and gross margin as a percent of trade sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were consistent with prior quarters during 2014. The improvement in the gross margin from 22.29% during the two months end December 31, 2013 to 24.12% during the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects the consolidation of the Concord manufacturing facility into the Brampton facility and higher average trade sales volume during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the two months ended December 31, 2013.\nRenin's interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $0.3 million of interest expense associated with the Bluegreen notes payable. Renin refinanced the Bluegreen notes payable with a financial institution in June 2014 at lower interest rates and outstanding balances.\nIncluded in selling, general and administrative expenses during the two months ended December 31, 2013 were $1.0 million of acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the Renin acquisition.\nSweet Holdings Reportable Segment Results of Operations\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the One\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMonth Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nEnded December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTrade sales\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,837 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>16,257 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>966 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(20,585) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(10,794) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(633) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,252 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,463 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>333 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>949 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>440 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>24 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBargain purchase gain\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(254) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,237) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15,324 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,237 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>347 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>16,019 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,440 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>371 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(8,767) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(38) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBenefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(329) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3,107) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(8,438) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,130 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(38) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>26.05 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>33.60 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34.47 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSG&A as a percent of trade sales\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>55.05 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>38.37 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>35.92 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Sweet Holdings results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of the activities of Hoffman's, Williams & Bennett, Helen Grace Chocolates, Jer's Chocolates and Anastasia Confections for the entire year and the operations of Kencraft for the nine months ended December 31, 2015.\nSweet Holdings results of operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the activities of Hoffman's and Williams and Bennett for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the activities of Jer's, Helen Grace and Anastasia from their respective dates of acquisition, July 1, 2014, July 21, 2014 and October 1, 2014.\nSweet Holdings results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the activities of Hoffman's for the month of December 2013.\nThe lower gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a higher percent of wholesale trade sales compared to retail trade sales and secondarily from approximately $725,000 of inventory markdowns related to Helen Grace and Williams & Bennett obsolete inventory. The majority of Sweet Holdings acquisitions subsequent to September 30, 2014 were acquisitions of manufacturers selling to wholesale customers. Trade sales to wholesale customers typically have lower gross margins than trade sales to retail customers.\nThe increase in interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from additional borrowings for working capital lines-of-credit and acquisition promissory notes.\nThe bargain purchase gain for the year ended December 31, 2015 was associated with the Kencraft acquisition and the bargain purchase gain for the year ended December 31, 2014 was associated with the Helen Grace acquisition. The bargain purchase gain represents the amount by which the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeded the purchase consideration. Management believes that it was able to acquire Kencraft and Helen Grace for bargain purchase gains because Kencraft and Helen Grace were distressed companies.\nThe higher selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects operating expenses associated with companies acquired and costs to integrate these companies as well as increased compensation expense related to the hiring of industry professionals and fees to consultants. Executives hired during the first quarter of 2015 included a President for BBX Sweet Holdings and a President for Hoffman's. Also contributing to higher selling, general and administrative expenses were costs associated with relocating the Helen Grace California manufacturing facilities to Kencraft's manufacturing facilities in Utah and costs associated with Hoffman's retail store expansion initiatives. Hoffman's opened one retail location during the third quarter of 2014 as well as three retail locations during the year ended December 31, 2015 and anticipates opening additional retail locations in 2016. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.3 million of employee severance expenses and costs to relocate the Helen Grace manufacturing facilities to Utah.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBBX Capital Corporation Consolidated Financial Condition\nBBX Capital's total assets as of December 31, 2015 were $393.5 million compared to $392.9 million as of December 31, 2014. The changes in the components of total assets from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 are summarized below:\n \u00b7 Increase in cash resulting primarily from sales of real estate and dividends from Woodbridge partially offset by land development and improvement costs, repayment of BB&T's preferred interest in FAR, notes payable scheduled payments, repayment of the Woodbridge note payable, investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, additional investment in Woodbridge and operating expenses. \n \u00b7 Increase in trade receivables due to acquisitions by BBX Sweet Holdings partially offset by $0.8 million of lower Renin trade receivables, \n \u00b7 Decrease in real estate held-for-investment due primarily to the transfer of $41.8 million of real estate held-for-investment to real estate held-for-sale and the contribution of $19.4 million of real estate to joint ventures partially offset by $16.0 million of property improvements, \n \u00b7 Increase in real estate held-for-sale due primarily to $41.8 million of properties transferred from real estate held-for-investment, $13.9 million of real estate purchases and property improvements and $3.2 million of real estate acquired through foreclosure partially offset by $51.0 million of real estate sales and $3.2 million in impairments, \n \u00b7 Increase in investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures reflecting $8.0 million of cash investments in real estate joint ventures and $19.4 million of property contributed to joint ventures in exchange for joint venture membership interests, \n \u00b7 Increase investment in Woodbridge reflecting an additional investment in Woodbridge of $11.4 million and the recognition of $15.0 million of equity in Woodbridge's earnings partially offset by $23.8 million of dividends received from Woodbridge, \n \u00b7 Increase in properties and equipment associated with the opening of Hoffman stores and corporate headquarter renovations partially offset by $2.1 million of depreciation expense, \n \u00b7 Increase in inventory resulting primarily from acquisitions by BBX Sweet Holdings, \n \u00b7 Increase in goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions by BBX Sweet Holdings, and \n \u00b7 Increase in other asset balances resulting primarily from $1.2 million of investments in securities and a $1.1 million escrow balance associated with land sales. \nBBX Capital's total liabilities at December 31, 2015 were $57.6 million compared to $81.7 million at December 31, 2014. The changes in the components of total liabilities from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 are summarized below:\n \u00b7 Higher accounts payable balances due primarily to an increase in trade accounts payable at Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings, \n \u00b7 Payment in full of BB&T's preferred interest in FAR using proceeds from the monetization of FAR's assets, \n \u00b7 Decrease in note payable to Woodbridge as the note was paid-in-full in September 2015, and \n \u00b7 Increase in notes payable reflecting $1.4 million of promissory notes issued in connection with the Kencraft acquisition, a $5.0 million line-of-credit from a financial institution issued to fund BBX Sweet Holdings working capital, partially offset by $3.6 million of notes payable scheduled principal repayments. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBBX Capital's current assets at December 31, 2015 consisted of cash, inventory and trade receivables aggregating $81.3 million. This does not include $18.0 million of current assets held in Renin. BBX Capital had $19.8 million of current liabilities as of December 31, 2015. This does not include $7.5 million of current liabilities of Renin. BBX Capital's principal sources of liquidity are its cash holdings, funds obtained from scheduled\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npayments on loans, loan recoveries, sales of its loans, loan payoffs, sales of real estate, income from income producing real estate, revenues from BBX Sweet Holdings' operations and distributions received from Woodbridge. Management believes that BBX Capital has sufficient liquidity to fund future operations.\nBluegreen's former public shareholders brought an action against Bluegreen, the directors of Bluegreen, BFC, Woodbridge, certain directors and officers of BFC and others, challenging the terms of the merger pursuant to which Bluegreen merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodbridge and Bluegreen's shareholders (other than Woodbridge) were paid $10.00 in cash for each share of Bluegreen's common stock that they held immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and on June 5, 2015 the plaintiffs and defendants agreed to a settlement of the litigation. Pursuant to the settlement, Woodbridge paid $36.5 million, which amounts to approximately $2.50 per share, into a settlement fund for the benefit of former shareholders of Bluegreen whose shares were acquired in connection with the merger. The amount to be received by such former Bluegreen shareholders will be reduced by administrative costs and attorneys' fees and costs. In connection with the settlement, BBX Capital repaid its $11.75 million promissory note to Woodbridge and BBX Capital and BFC made additional capital contributions to Woodbridge of $11.4 million and $13.4 million, respectively, based on their respective 46% and 54% ownership interests in Woodbridge.\nBBX Capital expects that it will receive dividends from time to time from its 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge. Distributions must be declared by Woodbridge and approved in advance by both BFC and BBX Capital. Dividends from Woodbridge will be dependent on and subject to Bluegreen's results of operations, cash flows and business of Bluegreen, as well as restrictions contained in Bluegreen's debt facilities. Additionally, in April 2015, BFC borrowed $80 million from Bluegreen to finance the purchase of 4,771,221 shares of BBX Capital's Class A common stock in BFC's completed tender offer. As a consequence, BBX Capital may not receive dividends from Woodbridge consistent with prior periods or in the time frames or amounts anticipated, or at all. BBX Capital may also receive funds from BFC in connection with its tax sharing agreement to the extent BFC utilizes BBX Capital's tax benefits in BFC's consolidated tax return. BBX Capital also expects to obtain funds in subsequent periods from cash flows on its loans, real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. BBX Capital also may seek to obtain funds through borrowings or the issuance of equity securities. BBX Capital anticipates utilizing these funds for general corporate purposes, including selling, general and administrative expenses, loan servicing costs, real estate operating expenses, Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings operating expenses and, to the extent of available liquidity, to pursue its business strategy of investing, directly or through joint ventures, in real estate (which may include the acquisition and/or development of real estate) and operating businesses. BBX Sweet Holdings currently intends to continue to pursue acquisitions in the candy and confections industry.\nA significant source of BBX Capital's liquidity is proceeds from the liquidation of loans and real estate, recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio, cash proceeds from the contribution of properties to real estate joint ventures and dividends from Woodbridge. During the year ended December 31, 2015, proceeds from principal repayments of loans and sales of real estate were approximately $30.2 million and $72.2 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, BBX Capital received $23.8 million of dividends from Woodbridge. There is no assurance that BBX Capital will realize proceeds from these sources in future periods in similar amounts or on similar timeframes.\nBBX Capital's real estate activities include hiring property managers to operate income producing properties, making protective expenditures (including the payment of property taxes) in an effort to maintain the value of properties and undertaking the zoning and entitlement, development or improvement of properties to position the properties for sale or potential joint venture arrangements. There is no assurance that BBX Capital will realize proceeds from these sources in future periods in similar amounts or on similar timeframes.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNotes payable as of December 31, 2015 consisted of a term loan and revolving credit advances issued by Renin with an aggregate balance of $8.1 million, $6.7 million of promissory notes and holdback amounts owed by BBX Sweet Holdings in connection with its acquisitions, $5.0 million revolving line of credit to BBX Sweet Holdings and a $1.6 million note payable issued by a subsidiary of BBX Sweet Holdings.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including the valuation of collateral dependent loans, the valuation of loans held-for-sale, the impairment of long-lived assets including amortizable intangible assets, real estate held-for-sale and held-for-investment, the determination of lower of cost or market for inventories, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business, the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting for uncertain tax positions and accounting for contingencies. The three accounting policies that BBX Capital has identified as critical accounting policies are allowance for loan losses, inventory reserves and impairment of long-lived assets. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPolicies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, for a detailed discussion of BBX Capital's significant accounting policies.\nAllowance for loan losses, valuation of collateral dependent loans and loans-held-for-sale\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount that is believed by its management to be a reasonable estimate of probable losses inherent in BBX Capital's loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements presented. BBX Capital has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the allowance for loan losses which considers all available information. However, BBX Capital relies on estimates and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown. As a consequence, if circumstances differ from BBX Capital's estimates and judgments, the allowance for loan losses may decrease or increase significantly and the amount of losses actually realized in BBX Capital's loan portfolio could be significantly higher or lower. There was no allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015. BBX Capital's loans receivable as of December 31, 2015 was $34.0 million and were primarily collateralized by real estate. Declines in real estate market condition in geographical areas where BBX Capital's collateral is located may result in material changes to BBX Capital's allowance for loan losses.\nIn June 2015, BBX Capital transferred its small business, residential and second-lien consumer loans from loans held-for-sale to loans receivable measured at the lower of cost or fair value at the transfer date. The difference between the carrying amount of the loans and the fair value was recognized as a discount. The discount on the transferred loans was greater than the calculated allowance for loan loss. As a consequence there was no allowance for loan losses assigned to these loans as of December 31, 2015.\nCommercial loans were evaluated individually and were either written down to the fair value of the collateral or based on the primary source of repayment and pier group analysis management determined no allowance for loan losses should be assigned to the commercial loan portfolio.\nValuation allowances or charge downs on collateral dependent loans and the fair value of loans held-for-sale are established using management estimates of the fair value of collateral or based on valuation models that present value estimated expected future cash flows. The outstanding balance of collateral dependent loans and loans held-for-sale was $9.6 million and $21.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.\nThese valuations are based on available information and require estimates and subjective judgments about fair values of the collateral or expected future cash flows. Most of BBX Capital's loans do not have an observable market price, and an estimate of the collection of contractual cash flows is based on the judgment of management. BBX Capital generally utilizes broker price opinions and third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value of collateral. The appraisers or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral. It is likely that the results would materially differ if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. As a consequence of the estimates and assumptions required to calculate the valuation allowance, charge downs on collateral dependent loans or the fair value of loans held-for-sale, a change in these highly uncertain estimates could have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on BBX Capital's financial condition and results of operations.\nBBX Capital analyzes its loan portfolio quarterly by monitoring credit quality, loan-to-value ratios, delinquency trends, collateral valuations and economic conditions. As a consequence, BBX Capital's allowance for loan losses and fair value estimates will change from period to period. BBX Capital believes that its performance in subsequent periods will be highly sensitive to changes in the Florida real estate market and availability of mortgage financing in Florida. If real estate and economic conditions deteriorate, BBX Capital is likely to experience increased credit losses and valuation allowance adjustments.\nInventory lower of cost or market\nInventories consisted of $8.4 million at Renin and $7.9 million at BBX Sweet Holdings as of December 31, 2015. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Fluctuations in the market price of raw materials and labor costs may affect the value of inventory and may have a favorable or unfavorable effect on\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncosts of goods sold and gross margin. For the Renin inventory, when expected market sales prices move below costs, or when BBX Capital identifies slow moving or obsolete inventory, BBX Capital records adjustments to write down the carrying values of inventories. Renin recognized $0.1 million of inventory adjustment write downs during the year ended December 31, 2015. BBX Sweet Holdings evaluates its inventory periodically and recognized $1.7 million of inventory adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2015. Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings maintain inventories of bulk raw materials and included in BBX Sweet Holdings inventory was paper goods and packaging material. For Renin, quantities were determined based upon its inventory systems and are subject to periodic verification techniques including observation, weighing and other methods. For BBX Sweet Holdings inventory quantities were determined by period-end observation and weighing. The quantities and costs are generally subject to change in estimates based on market sales prices and general economic conditions in the industry. As a consequence, if raw material or labor costs increase or if market sales prices decline, BBX Capital will likely experience higher amounts of obsolete inventory, higher inventory reserves with a corresponding increase cost of goods sold and lower gross margins.\nImpairment of long lived assets including amortizable intangible assets\nLong-lived assets such as properties and equipment, amortizable intangible assets and real estate held-for-investment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When testing a long-lived asset for recoverability, it may be necessary to review estimated lives and adjust the depreciation or amortization period. Changes in circumstances and the estimates of future cash flows, as well as evaluating estimated lives of long-lived assets, are subjective and involve a significant amount of judgment. A change in the estimated life of a long-lived asset may substantially change depreciation and amortization expense in subsequent periods.\nReal estate held-for-sale is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Fair values are not available for many of BBX Capital's long-lived assets, and estimates must be based on available information, including prices of similar assets and present value valuation techniques.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, BBX Capital recognized impairments on real estate of $3.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively. BBX Capital generally utilizes broker price opinions and third party appraisals to assist in determining the fair value of real estate. The appraisers or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the properties and BBX Capital may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the valuation date when current appraisals are not available.\nThe assumptions used to calculate the fair values are highly subjective and extremely sensitive to changes in market conditions. The assumptions used are representative of assumptions that BBX Capital believes market participants would use in fair valuing these assets, but different assumptions may result in significantly different results. BBX Capital validates assumptions by comparing completed transactions with prior period fair value estimates and BBX Capital may check its assumptions against multiple valuation sources.\nThe outstanding balance of real estate held-for-sale, real estate held-for-investment, amortizable intangible assets and properties and equipment was $46.3 million, $31.3 million, $8.2 million and $18.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The amount ultimately realized upon the sale or operation of these properties may be significantly different than the recorded amounts. Future events, including volatility in real estate values, may result in additional impairments or recoveries of long-lived assets in the foreseeable future.\nDividends\nBBX Capital has historically not paid dividends. While BBX Capital currently expects to continue to utilize its available cash to pursue opportunities in accordance with its business strategies, it may consider the payment of dividends in the future depending upon its results of operations, liquidity needs and other factors considered by its board of directors.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpact of Inflation\nThe financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nBBX Capital Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Florida in 1994. BBX Capital Corporation's principal asset until July 31, 2012 was its ownership of BankAtlantic and its subsidiaries. BankAtlantic was a federal savings bank headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and provided traditional retail banking services and a wide range of commercial banking products and related financial services through a broad network of community branches located in Florida. On July 31, 2012, BBX Capital completed the sale to BB&T of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of BankAtlantic (the BB&T Transaction\u201d).\nBBX Capital's activities subsequent to the consummation of the BB&T Transaction involve the ownership, acquisition, investment and management of real estate and real estate development projects as well as its investments in operating businesses.\nBBX Capital's investments in real estate joint ventures generally were arrangements with developers for residential and commercial development projects in which BBX Capital has funded its equity investment in joint ventures through cash investments or by contributing real estate properties.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nBBX Capital reports its consolidated results of operations in three reportable segments, BBX, Renin and Sweet Holdings.\nIncome (loss) from each of BBX Capital's reportable segments was as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Represents capitalized interest on real estate development and joint venture activities in excess of interest expense incurred in the BBX reportable segment. \nOverview\nBBX Reportable Segment\nThe increase in BBX reportable segment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from a $25.6 million increase in net gains on the sales of assets, $6.3 million of higher recoveries from loan losses and a $6.7 million reduction in asset impairments. The above improvements in BBX reportable segment income were partially offset by $10.3 million of lower equity in earnings from BBX Capital's investment in Woodbridge.\nGains on sales of assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $31.1 million compared to $5.5 million during the comparable 2014 period. The gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2015 resulted primarily from the sales of four properties. Two of the properties were located in West Palm Beach, Florida, a third property was located in the Bonterra master-planned community and the fourth property was acquired through a loan participation and sold by the lead bank. BBX recognized aggregate gains of $31.4 million in connection with sales of these four properties.\nRecoveries for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $13.5 million compared to $7.2 million during the comparable 2014 period. The improvement in recoveries during 2015 was mainly due to lower charge-offs and higher recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015 charge-offs were $1.0 million compared to $7.2 million during the same 2014 period.\nThe lower asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from $8.6 million of impairments on two student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a $1.8 million additional impairment on one of the student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe $10.3 million decline in the equity in earnings of Woodbridge resulted primarily from Woodbridge's $36.5 million settlement of litigation brought by Bluegreen's former shareholders related to Woodbridge's April 2013 acquisition of Bluegreen as described in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. As BBX has a 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge, the $36.5 million settlement reduced BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge by $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The reduction in BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge as a consequence of the litigation settlement was partially offset by improved earnings at Bluegreen. Bluegreen's net income attributable to shareholder was $68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $54.5 million during the comparable 2014 period.\nThe decline in BBX reportable segment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same 2013 period resulted primarily from $36.7 million of lower recoveries from loan losses and a $18.9 million decline in interest income recoveries associated with the repayment of non-accrual loans. The above declines in BBX reportable segment income were partially offset by $11.8 million of higher equity earnings from BBX Capital's investment in Woodbridge and lower interest expense associated with BB&T's preferred interest in FAR.\nRecoveries from loan losses and interest income recognized on non-accrual loans were $7.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $43.9 million and $24.3 million during the same 2013 period, respectively. The significant loan loss recoveries and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from a settlement with a borrower which resulted in reversals of previously charged-off commercial loans of $20.1 million and interest income recoveries of $13.6 million.\nBBX Capital's equity in earnings of Woodbridge was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $13.5 million during the same 2013 period. Equity in earnings of Woodbridge for the year ended December 31, 2013 were from the date of the investment (April 2, 2013) through December 31, 2013.\nRenin Reportable Segment\nRenin's reportable segment loss during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from $1.0 million of foreign exchange losses and expenses associated with the hiring of additional sales representatives and advertising expenditures for sales initiatives during 2015 as well as consulting expenditures to achieve product development and manufacturing efficiencies. Renin's new members of management include its CEO hired in June 2015 and a Vice President of Sales hired in September 2015. Renin incurred severance costs associated with the reorganization of its marketing and corporate personnel during the year ended December 31, 2015. Renin improved its gross margin and gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period as a greater proportion of Renin's trade sales were higher margin hardware products. Renin's interest expense was lower during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period as Renin refinanced its notes payable in June 2014 at lower interest rates.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRenin's reportable segment loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from a $0.7 million loss on foreign currency exchange and $0.9 million of costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in Canada.\nRenin's reportable segment loss for the two months ended December 31, 2013 included $1.0 million of acquisition related costs offset by a $1.0 million bargain purchase gain. Management believes that it was able to acquire Renin for a bargain purchase gain because Renin Corp. was a distressed company.\nSweet Holdings Reportable Segment\nThe higher Sweet Holdings reportable segment loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, inventory markdowns as well as lower acquisition bargain purchase gains partially offset by an increase in trade sales associated with acquired companies.\nThe higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects operating expenses associated with companies acquired and costs to integrate these companies as well as increased compensation expense related to the hiring of industry professionals and fees to consultants. Executives hired during the first quarter of 2015 included a President for BBX Sweet Holdings and a President for Hoffman's. Also contributing to higher selling, general and administrative expenses were costs associated with relocating the Helen Grace California manufacturing facilities to Kencraft's manufacturing facilities in Utah and costs associated with Hoffman's retail store expansion initiatives. Hoffman's opened one retail location during the third quarter of 2014 as well as three retail locations during the year ended December 31, 2015 and anticipates opening additional retail locations in 2016. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.3 million of employee severance expenses and costs to relocate the Helen Grace manufacturing facilities to Utah.\nThe gross margin was adversely affected for the year ended December 31, 2015 by $600,000 of inventory markdowns and the relocation of Helen Grace's manufacturing facilities from California to Utah in September 2015.\nThe bargain purchase gain of $254,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 was associated with the Kencraft acquisition and the bargain purchase gain of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was associated with the Helen Grace acquisition.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe benefit for income taxes of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from acquisition re-measurement adjustments and a reduction in BBX Capital's deferred tax valuation allowance as a result of net taxable temporary differences that Sweet Holdings recognized in connection with the Kencraft acquisition.\nThe $3.1 million benefit for income taxes represents the reduction in BBX Capital's deferred tax valuation allowance as a result of net taxable temporary differences that Sweet Holdings recognized in connection with its 2014 acquisitions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBBX Reportable Segment Results of Operations\nThe following table is a condensed income statement summarizing the results of operations of the BBX reportable segment ( BBX\u201d) (in thousands):\n\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects higher interest income recognized on a cash basis from the payoffs of nonaccrual loans partially offset by lower interest income recognized on accruing loans associated with declining accruing loan balances due primarily to loan repayments and loan sales. Accruing loan balances declined from $23.0 million as of December 31, 2013 to $6.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, $5.8 million of interest income was recognized on the payoff of two commercial loans.\nThe decline in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower interest income recognized on a cash basis from the settlement of non-accrual loans and secondarily from lower interest income recognized on accruing loans due primarily to lower accruing loan balances.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, $13.6 million of interest income was recovered in connection with the repayment of non-accrual loans pursuant to a settlement agreement with respect to litigation between CAM and Daniel S. Catalfumo and certain members of his family and affiliated entities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNet Gains on the Sales of Assets\nThe net gains on the sales of assets during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were primarily gains on the sales of real estate properties.\nGains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the sales of four properties. Two of the properties were located in West Palm Beach, Florida. One of the properties, which was purchased by the JRG/BBX Development joint venture for $10.8 million, was sold to a third party developer for $20.0 million. A second property, which had a $3.2 million carrying value at the date of sale, was acquired by BBX through foreclosure and sold for $11.0 million. A third property was located in the Bonterra master-planned community in Hialeah, Florida, had a carrying value of $13.9 million and sold for $26.2 million. The fourth property was acquired through foreclosure in Las Vegas, Nevada, had a carrying value of $2.6 million and sold for $6.0 million. BBX recognized gains of $31.4 million in the aggregate in connection with these four property sales.\nIncluded in net gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2014 was a $2.5 million gain on the sale of one property, the sale of first lien consumer and residential loans for a $0.6 million gain and gains of $1.3 million on the sales of various real estate properties.\nIncluded in net gains on the sales of assets during the year ended December 31, 2013 was a $1.5 million gain from the sale of rental property, $0.9 million of gains associated with the sale of tax certificates, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a storage facility and a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale commercial real estate loan.\nIncome from Real Estate Operations\nIncome from real estate operations consists of rental income from foreclosed properties.\nThe lower income from real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period resulted primarily from the sales of rental properties and one operating property during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe increase in income from real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same 2013 period reflects an increase in the number of income producing foreclosed properties which resulted in higher rental income during 2014 compared to 2013. The additional foreclosed properties included two student housing facilities that BBX acquired through settlements with borrowers in September 2013 and January 2014.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted mainly of $1.5 million of rental income from a public storage operating facility that was acquired through foreclosure in April 2013, $0.4 million of office facilities revenues paid by BFC for use of its office space and $0.4 million of management fees recognized from Sweet Holdings. The Sweet Holdings management fees were eliminated in consolidation.\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted mainly of $1.2 million of rental income associated with a public storage operating facility, $0.6 million of income associated with a foreclosed loan, $0.4 million of office facilities revenues from BFC and $0.2 million of management fees from Sweet Holdings.\nOther revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted mainly of $0.7 million of rental income associated with the public storage operating facility, $0.9 million of income associated with a foreclosed loan, $0.7 million of recoveries on loans in excess of contractual principal, $0.2 million of deposit overdraft recoveries associated with the charged off deposit overdraft portfolio retained in the BB&T Transaction and $0.4 million of office facilities revenues from BFC.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBB&Ts Priority Return in FAR Distributions\nBB&T's priority return in FAR distributions during the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 represented the priority return paid to BB&T pursuant to its preferred membership interests in FAR. The required priority return was set at LIBOR + 200 basis points per annum on the unpaid preferred membership interest preference amount. The preferred membership interest preference amount was reduced from $196.9 million as of December 31, 2012 to $72.1 million as of December 31, 2013 to $12.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and was paid in full in May 2015. FAR utilized cash receipts primarily from loan repayments and the sales of assets to repay the preference amount and fund the priority return.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 $0.4 million of BBX reportable segment interest expense was capitalized in connection with real estate development and joint venture activities. The capitalized interest expense for year ended December 31, 2015 was incurred in connection with the Woodbridge promissory note. The Woodbridge promissory note was repaid in full during September 2015.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from $0.6 million of interest expense recognized on the Woodbridge promissory note and $0.2 million of interest expense recognized on the Florida Community Bank mortgage. The $8.3 million Florida Community Bank mortgage was assumed by the Hialeah Communities joint venture in June 2014.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted from two notes payable aggregating $10.3 million issued as of December 31, 2012. The notes were issued to two third party participants in loans for which BBX Capital was the lead lender in connection with BBX Capital's acquisition of the participants' interest in a loan and certain real estate property. One note payable in the amount of $2.5 million was repaid in December 2013.\nReal Estate Operating Expenses\nReal estate operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 represent real estate holding costs, including taxes and insurance, associated with real estate acquired through foreclosure.\nThe decline in real estate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the sale of properties and the transfer of properties to real estate joint ventures.\nThe increase in real estate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from loan foreclosures.\nRecoveries from Loan Losses\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses were as follows (in thousands):\n\nLoan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were mainly second-lien consumer loans.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLoan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of a charge-off of a $1.9 million commercial non-mortgage business loan, $2.7 million of charge-offs associated with the transfer of performing second lien consumer loans to loans held-for-sale and $0.7 million of charge-offs due to initial charge downs on loans past due greater than 120 days and first lien foreclosures. The remaining charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2014 related primarily to updated valuations on collateral dependent loans.\nLoan charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of consumer and residential loan charge-offs of $3.3 million and charge-offs of $0.7 million upon the transfer of the loans to loans held-for-sale. The remaining charge-offs reflect updated valuations on non-accrual loans and initial charge downs on loans past due greater than 120 days.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to settlements on charged off commercial loans of $5.3 million and recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2014 related primarily to $6.1 million of cash collected on certain previously charged-off commercial loans and related judgments which were transferred from BankAtlantic to CAM in connection with the BB&T Transaction, $1.6 million of recoveries from non-accrual loan payoffs, $1.4 million of property tax refunds on a charged off commercial land loan and a $1.9 million recovery from the transfer of a commercial land loan to real estate held-for-investment.\nRecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2013 related primarily to the repayment of non-accrual commercial loans including two nonaccrual loans that were previously charged down by $9.5 million and the Catalfumo settlement agreement which resulted in reversals of previously charged-off commercial real estate and commercial non-real estate loans of $10.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Additionally, BBX foreclosed on a residential commercial real estate property resulting in an $11.0 million recovery as the fair value of the collateral based on an updated valuation was greater than the recorded investment in the loan. The remaining recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2013 related primarily to cash collected on certain previously charged-off loans and related judgments and recoveries from foreclosures as the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell was greater than the recorded investment on certain loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of a $1.0 million specific valuation allowances on two commercial non-real estate loans with an aggregate recorded investment of $3.0 million and $1.5 million allowance on consumer loans. The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2014, consisted primarily of consumer second-lien loans greater than 120 days past due and $0.1 million on commercial real estate loans. The majority of BBX's commercial loans receivable were collateral dependent and charged down to the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell. There was no allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015 as the consumer second-lien loans greater than 120 days past due were deemed uncollectible and charged-off.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from valuation allowance adjustments of $3.6 million on foreclosed real estate properties to reflect updated valuations partially offset by recoveries of previously written down loans in connection with short sales and payoffs of residential loans held-for-sale.\nAsset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily the result of $8.6 million of impairments on two student housing rental facilities in Tallahassee, Florida. The impairments reflected a decline in occupancy rates and rents per unit. The student housing impairments were partially offset by $1.6 million of loans held-for-sale valuation allowance recoveries associated with loan repayments, short sales and updated valuations.\nAsset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of $2.7 million of net impairments on real estate to reflect updated valuations, a $1.6 million increase in the loans held-for-sale valuation allowance and a $0.2 million increase in the provision for tax certificate losses. The real estate impairments were primarily associated with a $2.0 million impairment on an office warehouse property based on an updated valuation. The increase in the valuation allowance for loans held-for-sale resulted from a decline in small business loan valuations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nThe increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of higher share based compensation associated with the issuance of restricted stock awards and higher salaries and bonuses. Share based compensation increased $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the granting of 419,492, 396,082 and 430,000 shares of Class A restricted common stock awards in September 2015, October 2014 and October 2013, respectively. The higher salaries and bonuses were mainly due to new hires and annual salary increases.\nOccupancy and Equipment\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of increased rent associated with leasing additional corporate office space.\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 relate primarily to the operations of a public storage rental facility that was acquired through foreclosure in April 2013.\nProfessional Fees\nThe increase in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from higher accounting and consulting fees. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the insurance carrier reimbursed $1.7 million of legal fees in connection with the SEC civil action compared to no reimbursements of legal fees during the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher professional and accounting fees were mainly due to the BFC tender offer and higher audit fees associated with acquired businesses, real estate joint venture investments and the SEC civil action.\nThe increase in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from higher legal and consulting fees associated with the termination of the merger agreement with BFC and the SEC civil action. The SEC civil action trial commenced on November 3, 2014 and lasted six weeks.\nSEC Civil Penalty\nThe SEC civil penalty assessed against BBX Capital in connection with the SEC action was $4.6 million. While the penalty is being appealed, BBX Capital recognized $1.0 million of the civil penalty as an accrual during\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe year ended December 31, 2014 with the balance of the civil penalty of $3.6 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther\nThe decrease in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects $1.1 million of lower foreclosure costs. Foreclosure expenses consisted primarily of real estate taxes on delinquent collateral dependent loans in foreclosure. The decline in foreclosure expenses resulted primarily from a significant decrease in the number of loans in BBX's loan portfolio.\nThe decrease in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower foreclosure expenses. The significant decline in foreclosure expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 reflects $0.8 million of bankruptcy trustee and accounting fees associated with the foreclosure of two related properties during 2013 and a decision to pay delinquent real estate taxes on residential loans during 2013.\nAsset Servicing Expense\nAsset servicing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were fees to third party management companies who service loans and real estate. The significant decline in asset servicing costs reflects loan repayments and sales, real estate liquidations and the renegotiation of the servicing contract at lower rates as well as BBX taking back the servicing of certain commercial loans and real estate from a third party servicer.\nEquity in Earnings of Woodbridge\nBBX recognized equity in earnings of Woodbridge during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $15.0 million, $25.3 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Woodbridge's earnings for year ended December 31, 2015 included a $36.5 million settlement of litigation brought by Bluegreen's former shareholders related to Woodbridge's April 2013 acquisition of Bluegreen as described in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. As BBX has a 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge, the $36.5 million liability reduced BBX's equity in earnings of Woodbridge by $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Equity in earnings of Woodbridge for the year ended December 31, 2013 were from the date of the investment (April 2, 2013) through December 31, 2013. Woodbridge's earnings consisted primarily of the operations of Bluegreen.\nBluegreen Corporation is a sales, marketing, and management company focused on the vacation ownership industry. Bluegreen Vacations markets, sells and manages vacation ownership interests in resorts, which are generally located in popular, high-volume, drive-to\u201d vacation destinations. The resorts in which Bluegreen Vacations markets, sells or manages VOIs were either developed or acquired by Bluegreen, or were developed and are owned by third parties. Bluegreen Vacations earns fees for providing sales and marketing services to these third party developers. Bluegreen Vacations also earns fees by providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and property owners' associations, mortgage servicing, VOI title services, reservation services, and construction design and development services. In addition, Bluegreen Vacations provides financing to FICO\u00ae score-qualified individual purchasers of VOIs, which generates significant interest income.\nIn addition to Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership operations, Bluegreen has in recent years pursued a business strategy, referred to herein as the capital-light\u201d business strategy, involving activities that typically do not require the significant costs and capital investments generally incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of VOIs under Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen believes its capital-light business strategy enables it to leverage its expertise and existing infrastructure in resort management, sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, title services, and construction management to generate recurring revenues from third parties. Bluegreen's goal is for its capital-light business activities to become an increasing portion of its business over time; however, these efforts may not be successful. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen's capital-light business activities consisted of the following: fee-based sales and marketing arrangements; just-in-time\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninventory acquisition arrangements; secondary market arrangements; and other fee-based services. Each of these categories is described below.\nFee-Based Sales and Marketing Arrangements\nIn 2009, Bluegreen began offering sales and marketing services to third-party developers for a fee. Under these arrangements, Bluegreen sells third-party VOIs as Bluegreen Vacation Club interests through its distribution network of sales offices, typically on a non-committed basis. Bluegreen seeks to structure its fee for these services to cover its selling and marketing costs, plus an operating profit. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects and Bluegreen has little to no capital requirements. Notes receivable originated in connection with Bluegreen's sale of third party VOIs under commission-based arrangements are held by the third party developer, and in certain cases are serviced by Bluegreen for a fee. Bluegreen refers to sales made on behalf of third-party developers as FBS Sales\u201d.\nJust-In-Time Arrangements\nIn 2013, Bluegreen began entering into agreements with third-party developers that allow Bluegreen to buy VOI inventory from time to time in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Bluegreen strives to enter into such arrangements on a non-committed basis, although Bluegreen may engage in committed arrangements under certain circumstances. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects. Unlike FBS Sales, receivables originated in connection with sales of just-in-time inventory are held by Bluegreen. Bluegreen refers to sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements as Just-In-Time Sales\u201d.\nSecondary Market Arrangements\nIn 2012, Bluegreen began a program to acquire VOI inventory from POAs and other third parties on a non-committed basis, in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Such VOIs are typically obtained by the POAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults, and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a significant discount. Bluegreen refers to sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements as Secondary Market Sales\u201d.\nOther Fee-Based Services\nBluegreen also earns fees for providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and to certain POAs. In connection with the management services provided to the Bluegreen Vacation Club, Bluegreen manages the club reservation system and provides owner services as well as billing and collection services. In connection with Bluegreen's management of POAs, Bluegreen provides day-to-day management services, including oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance, and certain accounting and administrative services. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen provided management services to 46 timeshare resort properties and hotels. Other fee-based services also include the processing of sales of VOIs through Bluegreen's wholly-owned title company subsidiary, which earns title fees in connection with the closing of the VOI transactions.\nBluegreen's Operating Results\nBluegreen's net income attributable to Woodbridge was $70.3 million, $57.5 million and $37.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The higher Bluegreen net income in each year during the three year period ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from increased sales of VOIs sold on behalf of third parties on a commission basis and higher commissions earned on these commission based sales. The increase in VOI sales primarily reflected the results of an increased number of tours. Bluegreen's management believes that the increase in tours mainly resulted from efforts to expand marketing initiatives to new sales prospects as well as expanded marketing programs targeting existing owners. The increase in sales was partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses associated with these marketing initiatives. Sales to existing owners\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngenerally involve lower marketing expenses than sales to new prospects. Bluegreen expects to continue to increase its focus on sales to new prospects and, as a result, sales and marketing expenses may continue to increase.\nEquity in Losses of Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures\nBBX recognized equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.6 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are generally real estate joint ventures that develop properties for residential and commercial use. The joint ventures are currently in the entitlement and construction phases and the losses during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 mainly represent marketing and management fees.\nRenin Reportable Segment Results of Operations\n\nTrade sales declined for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same 2014 period due to the discontinuation by a major customer of the wall d\u00e9cor product partially offset by increased sales of newly designed hardware products.\nThe improvement in the gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31 2015 compared to the same 2014 period reflects increased sales of higher margin hardware products and lower sales of lower margin wall d\u00e9cor products. Also contributing to the improved gross margin percentage was the consolidation of manufacturing facilities during the second half of 2014.\nRenin's interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from the Bluegreen notes payable. Renin refinanced the Bluegreen notes payable with a financial institution in June 2014 under a facility with lower interest rates and outstanding balances. The decline in average notes payable balances was the result of BBX Capital and BFC contributing $2.0 million and $0.5 million of capital, respectively, to repay a portion of the Bluegreen notes payable in connection with the refinancing transaction.\nIncluded in Renin's selling, general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2015 were salaries and recruitment fees associated with the hiring of additional sales representatives and advertising expenditures for sales initiatives as well as consulting expenditures associated with identifying ways to enhance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nproduct development and improve manufacturing efficiencies. Renin's new members of management include its CEO hired in June 2015 and a Vice President of Sales hired in September 2015. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was severance associated with the reorganization of Renin's marketing and corporate personnel.\nIncluded in Renin's selling, general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.9 million of costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in Canada. Renin also incurred $0.1 million of acquisition related expenses and $0.2 million of process improvement professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe loss on foreign currency exchange for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 resulted from the decrease in value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate declined from 94.02 as of December 31, 2013 to 86.2 as of December 31, 2014 to 72.09 at December 31, 2015.\nRenin's trade sales and gross margin as a percent of trade sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were consistent with prior quarters during 2014. The improvement in the gross margin from 22.29% during the two months end December 31, 2013 to 24.12% during the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects the consolidation of the Concord manufacturing facility into the Brampton facility and higher average trade sales volume during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the two months ended December 31, 2013.\nRenin's interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $0.3 million of interest expense associated with the Bluegreen notes payable. Renin refinanced the Bluegreen notes payable with a financial institution in June 2014 at lower interest rates and outstanding balances.\nIncluded in selling, general and administrative expenses during the two months ended December 31, 2013 were $1.0 million of acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the Renin acquisition.\nSweet Holdings Reportable Segment Results of Operations\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Sweet Holdings results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of the activities of Hoffman's, Williams & Bennett, Helen Grace Chocolates, Jer's Chocolates and Anastasia Confections for the entire year and the operations of Kencraft for the nine months ended December 31, 2015.\nSweet Holdings results of operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the activities of Hoffman's and Williams and Bennett for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the activities of Jer's, Helen Grace and Anastasia from their respective dates of acquisition, July 1, 2014, July 21, 2014 and October 1, 2014.\nSweet Holdings results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the activities of Hoffman's for the month of December 2013.\nThe lower gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a higher percent of wholesale trade sales compared to retail trade sales and secondarily from approximately $725,000 of inventory markdowns related to Helen Grace and Williams & Bennett obsolete inventory. The majority of Sweet Holdings acquisitions subsequent to September 30, 2014 were acquisitions of manufacturers selling to wholesale customers. Trade sales to wholesale customers typically have lower gross margins than trade sales to retail customers.\nThe increase in interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from additional borrowings for working capital lines-of-credit and acquisition promissory notes.\nThe bargain purchase gain for the year ended December 31, 2015 was associated with the Kencraft acquisition and the bargain purchase gain for the year ended December 31, 2014 was associated with the Helen Grace acquisition. The bargain purchase gain represents the amount by which the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeded the purchase consideration. Management believes that it was able to acquire Kencraft and Helen Grace for bargain purchase gains because Kencraft and Helen Grace were distressed companies.\nThe higher selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 reflects operating expenses associated with companies acquired and costs to integrate these companies as well as increased compensation expense related to the hiring of industry professionals and fees to consultants. Executives hired during the first quarter of 2015 included a President for BBX Sweet Holdings and a President for Hoffman's. Also contributing to higher selling, general and administrative expenses were costs associated with relocating the Helen Grace California manufacturing facilities to Kencraft's manufacturing facilities in Utah and costs associated with Hoffman's retail store expansion initiatives. Hoffman's opened one retail location during the third quarter of 2014 as well as three retail locations during the year ended December 31, 2015 and anticipates opening additional retail locations in 2016. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.3 million of employee severance expenses and costs to relocate the Helen Grace manufacturing facilities to Utah.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBBX Capital Corporation Consolidated Financial Condition\nBBX Capital's total assets as of December 31, 2015 were $393.5 million compared to $392.9 million as of December 31, 2014. The changes in the components of total assets from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 are summarized below:\n \u00b7 Increase in cash resulting primarily from sales of real estate and dividends from Woodbridge partially offset by land development and improvement costs, repayment of BB&T's preferred interest in FAR, notes payable scheduled payments, repayment of the Woodbridge note payable, investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, additional investment in Woodbridge and operating expenses. \n \u00b7 Increase in trade receivables due to acquisitions by BBX Sweet Holdings partially offset by $0.8 million of lower Renin trade receivables, \n \u00b7 Decrease in real estate held-for-investment due primarily to the transfer of $41.8 million of real estate held-for-investment to real estate held-for-sale and the contribution of $19.4 million of real estate to joint ventures partially offset by $16.0 million of property improvements, \n \u00b7 Increase in real estate held-for-sale due primarily to $41.8 million of properties transferred from real estate held-for-investment, $13.9 million of real estate purchases and property improvements and $3.2 million of real estate acquired through foreclosure partially offset by $51.0 million of real estate sales and $3.2 million in impairments, \n \u00b7 Increase in investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures reflecting $8.0 million of cash investments in real estate joint ventures and $19.4 million of property contributed to joint ventures in exchange for joint venture membership interests, \n \u00b7 Increase investment in Woodbridge reflecting an additional investment in Woodbridge of $11.4 million and the recognition of $15.0 million of equity in Woodbridge's earnings partially offset by $23.8 million of dividends received from Woodbridge, \n \u00b7 Increase in properties and equipment associated with the opening of Hoffman stores and corporate headquarter renovations partially offset by $2.1 million of depreciation expense, \n \u00b7 Increase in inventory resulting primarily from acquisitions by BBX Sweet Holdings, \n \u00b7 Increase in goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions by BBX Sweet Holdings, and \n \u00b7 Increase in other asset balances resulting primarily from $1.2 million of investments in securities and a $1.1 million escrow balance associated with land sales. \nBBX Capital's total liabilities at December 31, 2015 were $57.6 million compared to $81.7 million at December 31, 2014. The changes in the components of total liabilities from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 are summarized below:\n \u00b7 Higher accounts payable balances due primarily to an increase in trade accounts payable at Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings, \n \u00b7 Payment in full of BB&T's preferred interest in FAR using proceeds from the monetization of FAR's assets, \n \u00b7 Decrease in note payable to Woodbridge as the note was paid-in-full in September 2015, and \n \u00b7 Increase in notes payable reflecting $1.4 million of promissory notes issued in connection with the Kencraft acquisition, a $5.0 million line-of-credit from a financial institution issued to fund BBX Sweet Holdings working capital, partially offset by $3.6 million of notes payable scheduled principal repayments. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBBX Capital's current assets at December 31, 2015 consisted of cash, inventory and trade receivables aggregating $81.3 million. This does not include $18.0 million of current assets held in Renin. BBX Capital had $19.8 million of current liabilities as of December 31, 2015. This does not include $7.5 million of current liabilities of Renin. BBX Capital's principal sources of liquidity are its cash holdings, funds obtained from scheduled\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npayments on loans, loan recoveries, sales of its loans, loan payoffs, sales of real estate, income from income producing real estate, revenues from BBX Sweet Holdings' operations and distributions received from Woodbridge. Management believes that BBX Capital has sufficient liquidity to fund future operations.\nBluegreen's former public shareholders brought an action against Bluegreen, the directors of Bluegreen, BFC, Woodbridge, certain directors and officers of BFC and others, challenging the terms of the merger pursuant to which Bluegreen merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodbridge and Bluegreen's shareholders (other than Woodbridge) were paid $10.00 in cash for each share of Bluegreen's common stock that they held immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and on June 5, 2015 the plaintiffs and defendants agreed to a settlement of the litigation. Pursuant to the settlement, Woodbridge paid $36.5 million, which amounts to approximately $2.50 per share, into a settlement fund for the benefit of former shareholders of Bluegreen whose shares were acquired in connection with the merger. The amount to be received by such former Bluegreen shareholders will be reduced by administrative costs and attorneys' fees and costs. In connection with the settlement, BBX Capital repaid its $11.75 million promissory note to Woodbridge and BBX Capital and BFC made additional capital contributions to Woodbridge of $11.4 million and $13.4 million, respectively, based on their respective 46% and 54% ownership interests in Woodbridge.\nBBX Capital expects that it will receive dividends from time to time from its 46% ownership interest in Woodbridge. Distributions must be declared by Woodbridge and approved in advance by both BFC and BBX Capital. Dividends from Woodbridge will be dependent on and subject to Bluegreen's results of operations, cash flows and business of Bluegreen, as well as restrictions contained in Bluegreen's debt facilities. Additionally, in April 2015, BFC borrowed $80 million from Bluegreen to finance the purchase of 4,771,221 shares of BBX Capital's Class A common stock in BFC's completed tender offer. As a consequence, BBX Capital may not receive dividends from Woodbridge consistent with prior periods or in the time frames or amounts anticipated, or at all. BBX Capital may also receive funds from BFC in connection with its tax sharing agreement to the extent BFC utilizes BBX Capital's tax benefits in BFC's consolidated tax return. BBX Capital also expects to obtain funds in subsequent periods from cash flows on its loans, real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. BBX Capital also may seek to obtain funds through borrowings or the issuance of equity securities. BBX Capital anticipates utilizing these funds for general corporate purposes, including selling, general and administrative expenses, loan servicing costs, real estate operating expenses, Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings operating expenses and, to the extent of available liquidity, to pursue its business strategy of investing, directly or through joint ventures, in real estate (which may include the acquisition and/or development of real estate) and operating businesses. BBX Sweet Holdings currently intends to continue to pursue acquisitions in the candy and confections industry.\nA significant source of BBX Capital's liquidity is proceeds from the liquidation of loans and real estate, recoveries from the charged off loan portfolio, cash proceeds from the contribution of properties to real estate joint ventures and dividends from Woodbridge. During the year ended December 31, 2015, proceeds from principal repayments of loans and sales of real estate were approximately $30.2 million and $72.2 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, BBX Capital received $23.8 million of dividends from Woodbridge. There is no assurance that BBX Capital will realize proceeds from these sources in future periods in similar amounts or on similar timeframes.\nBBX Capital's real estate activities include hiring property managers to operate income producing properties, making protective expenditures (including the payment of property taxes) in an effort to maintain the value of properties and undertaking the zoning and entitlement, development or improvement of properties to position the properties for sale or potential joint venture arrangements. There is no assurance that BBX Capital will realize proceeds from these sources in future periods in similar amounts or on similar timeframes.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNotes payable as of December 31, 2015 consisted of a term loan and revolving credit advances issued by Renin with an aggregate balance of $8.1 million, $6.7 million of promissory notes and holdback amounts owed by BBX Sweet Holdings in connection with its acquisitions, $5.0 million revolving line of credit to BBX Sweet Holdings and a $1.6 million note payable issued by a subsidiary of BBX Sweet Holdings. See Note 15, Notes Payable to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, for a discussion of the notes payable terms and covenants.\nBBX Capital guarantees certain obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. See Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15, Notes Payable to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, for a discussion of BBX Capital's guarantees.\nBBX Capital's Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Arrangements as of December 31, 2015 were (in thousands):\n\n(1) Amounts represent scheduled principal payments and do not include interest payments.\nThe operating lease obligations represent minimum future lease payments on executed leases for BBX Capital's headquarters, BBX Sweet Holdings and subsidiaries' manufacturing facilities, office space and retail stores and Renin's manufacturing, equipment leases and office facilities.\nBBX Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries are parties to lawsuits as plaintiff or defendant involving its collections, lending and prior period tax certificate activities. Although BBX Capital believes it has meritorious defenses in all current legal actions, the outcome and the ultimate resolution of litigation are inherently difficult to predict and uncertain.\nReserves are accrued for matters in which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving these legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts anticipated for these claims. There were no reserves accrued as of December 31, 2015. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for more information regarding BBX Capital's legal matters.\nBBX Capital had no commitments to fund loans as of December 31, 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nA summary of BBX Capital's consolidated cash flows follows (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from higher operating losses at Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower operating expenses associated with a decline in loan servicing fees, foreclosure expenses and collection fees associated with a declining loan portfolio.\nThe decline in cash flows from investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from higher investments in real estate and real estate joint ventures as well as an additional $11.4 million investment in Woodbridge partially offset by a $38.9 million increase in proceeds from the sales of real estate.\nThe decline in cash flows from investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower loan payments partially offset by a $60.4 million investment in Woodbridge in April 2013.\nThe decrease in cash outflows from financing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 resulted primarily from lower distributions to BB&T from FAR on account of the payoff of BB&T's preferred interest in FAR in May 2015 partially offset by the repayment of the Woodbridge notes payable.\nThe decrease in cash outflows from financing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 resulted primarily from lower distributions to BB&T from FAR.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the understanding of BBX Capital's financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently uncertain matters. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including the valuation of collateral dependent loans, the valuation of loans held-for-sale, the impairment of long-lived assets including amortizable intangible assets, real estate held-for-sale and held-for-investment, the determination of lower of cost or market for inventories, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business, the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting for uncertain tax positions and accounting for contingencies. The three accounting policies that BBX Capital has identified as critical accounting policies are allowance for loan losses, inventory reserves and impairment of long-lived assets. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPolicies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, for a detailed discussion of BBX Capital's significant accounting policies.\nAllowance for loan losses, valuation of collateral dependent loans and loans-held-for-sale\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount that is believed by its management to be a reasonable estimate of probable losses inherent in BBX Capital's loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements presented. BBX Capital has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the allowance for loan losses which considers all available information. However, BBX Capital relies on estimates and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown. As a consequence, if circumstances differ from BBX Capital's estimates and judgments, the allowance for loan losses may decrease or increase significantly and the amount of losses actually realized in BBX Capital's loan portfolio could be significantly higher or lower. There was no allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015. BBX Capital's loans receivable as of December 31, 2015 was $34.0 million and were primarily collateralized by real estate. Declines in real estate market condition in geographical areas where BBX Capital's collateral is located may result in material changes to BBX Capital's allowance for loan losses.\nIn June 2015, BBX Capital transferred its small business, residential and second-lien consumer loans from loans held-for-sale to loans receivable measured at the lower of cost or fair value at the transfer date. The difference between the carrying amount of the loans and the fair value was recognized as a discount. The discount on the transferred loans was greater than the calculated allowance for loan loss. As a consequence there was no allowance for loan losses assigned to these loans as of December 31, 2015.\nCommercial loans were evaluated individually and were either written down to the fair value of the collateral or based on the primary source of repayment and pier group analysis management determined no allowance for loan losses should be assigned to the commercial loan portfolio.\nValuation allowances or charge downs on collateral dependent loans and the fair value of loans held-for-sale are established using management estimates of the fair value of collateral or based on valuation models that present value estimated expected future cash flows. The outstanding balance of collateral dependent loans and loans held-for-sale was $9.6 million and $21.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.\nThese valuations are based on available information and require estimates and subjective judgments about fair values of the collateral or expected future cash flows. Most of BBX Capital's loans do not have an observable market price, and an estimate of the collection of contractual cash flows is based on the judgment of management. BBX Capital generally utilizes broker price opinions and third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value of collateral. The appraisers or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral. It is likely that the results would materially differ if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. As a consequence of the estimates and assumptions required to calculate the valuation allowance, charge downs on collateral dependent loans or the fair value of loans held-for-sale, a change in these highly uncertain estimates could have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on BBX Capital's financial condition and results of operations.\nBBX Capital analyzes its loan portfolio quarterly by monitoring credit quality, loan-to-value ratios, delinquency trends, collateral valuations and economic conditions. As a consequence, BBX Capital's allowance for loan losses and fair value estimates will change from period to period. BBX Capital believes that its performance in subsequent periods will be highly sensitive to changes in the Florida real estate market and availability of mortgage financing in Florida. If real estate and economic conditions deteriorate, BBX Capital is likely to experience increased credit losses and valuation allowance adjustments.\nInventory lower of cost or market\nInventories consisted of $8.4 million at Renin and $7.9 million at BBX Sweet Holdings as of December 31, 2015. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Fluctuations in the market price of raw materials and labor costs may affect the value of inventory and may have a favorable or unfavorable effect on\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncosts of goods sold and gross margin. For the Renin inventory, when expected market sales prices move below costs, or when BBX Capital identifies slow moving or obsolete inventory, BBX Capital records adjustments to write down the carrying values of inventories. Renin recognized $0.1 million of inventory adjustment write downs during the year ended December 31, 2015. BBX Sweet Holdings evaluates its inventory periodically and recognized $1.7 million of inventory adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2015. Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings maintain inventories of bulk raw materials and included in BBX Sweet Holdings inventory was paper goods and packaging material. For Renin, quantities were determined based upon its inventory systems and are subject to periodic verification techniques including observation, weighing and other methods. For BBX Sweet Holdings inventory quantities were determined by period-end observation and weighing. The quantities and costs are generally subject to change in estimates based on market sales prices and general economic conditions in the industry. As a consequence, if raw material or labor costs increase or if market sales prices decline, BBX Capital will likely experience higher amounts of obsolete inventory, higher inventory reserves with a corresponding increase cost of goods sold and lower gross margins.\nImpairment of long lived assets including amortizable intangible assets\nLong-lived assets such as properties and equipment, amortizable intangible assets and real estate held-for-investment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When testing a long-lived asset for recoverability, it may be necessary to review estimated lives and adjust the depreciation or amortization period. Changes in circumstances and the estimates of future cash flows, as well as evaluating estimated lives of long-lived assets, are subjective and involve a significant amount of judgment. A change in the estimated life of a long-lived asset may substantially change depreciation and amortization expense in subsequent periods.\nReal estate held-for-sale is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Fair values are not available for many of BBX Capital's long-lived assets, and estimates must be based on available information, including prices of similar assets and present value valuation techniques.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, BBX Capital recognized impairments on real estate of $3.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively. BBX Capital generally utilizes broker price opinions and third party appraisals to assist in determining the fair value of real estate. The appraisers or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the properties and BBX Capital may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the valuation date when current appraisals are not available.\nThe assumptions used to calculate the fair values are highly subjective and extremely sensitive to changes in market conditions. The assumptions used are representative of assumptions that BBX Capital believes market participants would use in fair valuing these assets, but different assumptions may result in significantly different results. BBX Capital validates assumptions by comparing completed transactions with prior period fair value estimates and BBX Capital may check its assumptions against multiple valuation sources.\nThe outstanding balance of real estate held-for-sale, real estate held-for-investment, amortizable intangible assets and properties and equipment was $46.3 million, $31.3 million, $8.2 million and $18.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The amount ultimately realized upon the sale or operation of these properties may be significantly different than the recorded amounts. Future events, including volatility in real estate values, may result in additional impairments or recoveries of long-lived assets in the foreseeable future.\nDividends\nBBX Capital has historically not paid dividends. While BBX Capital currently expects to continue to utilize its available cash to pursue opportunities in accordance with its business strategies, it may consider the payment of dividends in the future depending upon its results of operations, liquidity needs and other factors considered by its board of directors.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpact of Inflation\nThe financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.", "item_7_tables": "Table 93: <table> <tr>

are ownership of real estate and investments in operating businesses after the 2012 sale of BankAtlantic. Its activities involve real estate ownership, acquisition and management, as well as investments in companies like Renin and Sweet Holdings.\n\nResults of Operations\n- BBX, Renin and Sweet Holdings are BBX Capital's three reportable business segments. \n- BBX segment income increased in 2015 mainly due to higher gains on asset sales, recoveries from loan losses, and lower asset impairments, partially offset by lower equity earnings from Woodbridge.\n- Renin had losses in 2015 from foreign exchange, costs to hire sales staff and improve manufacturing, and severance costs. \n- Sweet Holdings' 2015 loss increased due to higher SG&A expenses from acquisitions and retail expansion, and inventory markdowns, partially offset by increased trade sales.\n\nFinancial Condition\n- Total assets were similar year-over-year. Increases in cash, trade receivables, JV investments and Woodbridge investment were partially offset by decreases in real estate and FAR preferred interest payoff.\n- Total liabilities decreased mainly due to the FAR preferred interest payoff and lower Woodbridge note payable.\n\nLiquidity and Capital\n- Sources of liquidity include cash holdings, loan payments, real estate and business sales, income properties, Sweet Holdings revenue and Woodbridge distributions. These are used for operating expenses, investing activities and debt repayment.\n- A legal settlement resulted in BBX Capital repaying and contributing additional funds to Woodbridge, reducing availability of Woodbridge dividends.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Key policies include allowance for loan losses, inventory reserves and asset impairments. These involve significant estimates and judgments about matters like collateral values, expected cash flows, and inventory quantities and costs."}
