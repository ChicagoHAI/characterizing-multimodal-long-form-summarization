Total costs associated with these initiatives are expected to be approximately $6 million, of which $2.9 million has been incurred to date.\n\ufeff\nRefinancing Activity\n\ufeff\nThe following recent financing activity has a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 10, Debt\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional detail regarding debt.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we refinanced a portion of our debt to extend maturities and reduce borrowing costs. On September 20, 2016, we issued \u20ac425 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% unsecured notes due 2026 (the 4.00% Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the 4.00% Notes and draws on the Revolver were used to repay our outstanding 6.375% unsecured notes due 2020 (the 6.375% Notes\u201d) and pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing. The Company repurchased $390.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% Notes through a cash tender offer on September 20, 2016, with the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of $129.7 million subsequently redeemed by the Company on October 20, 2016.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2015, we refinanced a portion of our debt to improve liquidity, extend maturities and reduce borrowing costs. On May 20, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of AAG, we issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% unsecured notes due 2025 (the 5.75% Notes\u201d). On June 23, 2015, we entered into term loan facilities pursuant to a Senior Credit Agreement consisting of (i) a $1,450 million USD Term Loan due June 23, 2022, (ii) a $75 million CAD Term Loan due June 23, 2022 and (iii) a \u20ac300 million Euro Term Loan due June 23, 2022, (collectively, Term Loans\u201d) and (iv) entered into a $500 million Revolver Facility due June 23, 2020 (the Revolver\u201d). The proceeds from the Term Loans and draws on the Revolver were used to repay our then-existing senior term credit facility, repay our outstanding 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2020, repay and replace our then-existing asset based revolving loan ( ABL\u201d) facility and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, on December 3, 2014, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.12% unsecured notes due 2024 (the 6.125% Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the 6.125% Notes were used to fund acquisition activity, pay fees and expenses in connection with the financing and general corporate purposes.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2014, the Company amended its then-existing senior term credit facility, issuing two tranches maturing September 4, 2019 which provide for borrowings in the principal amounts of $215.0 million and \u20ac225.0 million. The proceeds from the amendment were used to refinance a portion of the then-existing senior term credit facility which was scheduled to mature December 17, 2019, in an amount outstanding of $513.3 million prior to refinancing. The $215.0 million U.S. dollar denominated portion was combined with the then-existing Tranche C maturing September 4, 2019. These loans were refinanced during the year ended September 30, 2015 as described above.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following is summarized consolidated results of operations for SBH for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively:\n\ufeff\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions, except %)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,039.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,690.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>349.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,690.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>4,429.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>261.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5.9% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross Profit\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,919.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,670.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>249.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.9% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,670.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,568.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>101.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6.5% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,263.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,196.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>67.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5.6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,196.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,087.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>109.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10.0% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>250.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>271.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(21.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(8.1%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>271.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>202.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>69.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>34.5% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>40.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>43.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(8.9%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>43.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>59.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(15.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(25.6%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>357.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>149.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>208.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>139.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>149.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>214.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(65.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(30.3%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nNet Sales.

Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $249.6 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2015 primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and increase in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin increased from 35.6% to 38.1% contributed to by the AAG acquisition, and a shift towards higher margin product sales and continuing cost improvements across segments. Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $101.4 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 attributable to our increase in net sales. Gross profit margin increased from 35.4% to 35.6% primarily attributable to a shift towards higher margin product sales and cost improvement initiatives.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $67.5 million or 5.6% compared to the year ended September 30, 2015 primarily attributable to an increase in selling and general and administrative expenses of $89.4 million due to increased net sales, prior year acquisitions and increased share based compensation of $16.8 million; offset by decreased acquisition & integration related charges of $22.1 million and decreased restructuring and related charges of $11.9 million. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $109.2 million or 10.0% primarily attributable to an increase of $59.7 million in selling and general and administrative expenses as a result of acquisition activity and increased net sales, increased acquisition and integration costs of $38.7 million and increased restructuring and related charges of $7.4 million for new and continuing restructuring initiatives.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional detail on acquisition and integration costs. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Restructuring and Related Charges\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional detail on restructuring activity and related costs.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $21.9 million or 8.1% from the year ended September 30, 2015, attributable to the refinancing activity during the year ended September 30, 2015 previously discussed, coupled with payments on Term Loans; partially offset by $21.4 million of non-recurring costs due to refinancing activity during the year ended September 30, 2016, including (i) $15.6 million tendedr premium upon the repayment of 6.375% senior unsecured notes; and (iii) $5.8 million non-cash expense for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of 6.375% senior unsecured notes. Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $69.8 million or 34.5% from the year ended September 30, 2014, attributable to refinancing activity previously discussed, resulting in $58.8 million of non-recurring costs, including (i) $14.1 million for bridge financing commitments associated with the AAG acquisition, (ii) $4.5 million interest on assumed AAG senior notes from the date of the acquisition through payoff in June 2015, (iii) $16.9 million call premium upon the repayment of 6.75% senior unsecured notes; (iv) $4.1 million non-cash expense for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of 6.75% senior unsecured notes; (v) $10.4 million in fees associated with refinancing the then-existing senior term credit facility; and (vi) $8.8 million non-cash expense for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and discounts on the then-existing senior credit facility and ABL revolving loan facility. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 10.1% for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to 22.7% for the year ended September 30, 2015. Our estimated annual effective tax rate applied to these periods differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the release of valuation allowances on U.S. net operating losses deferred tax assets and income earned outside the U.S. that is subject to statutory rates lower than 35% offsetting tax expense on U.S. pretax income. Our effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2016 includes a $25.5 million expense to record a tax contingency reserve for a tax exposure in Germany. During the year, a local court ruled against our characterization of certain assets as amortizable under Germany tax law. We have appealed this ruling to the German Federal Court. While we continue to believe that our tax treatment was correct under the applicable German law, we have concluded that sufficient uncertainty on the ruling from the German Federal Court exists to record a full tax contingency for this exposure. Also included are $25.1 million of tax benefits, resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional discussion and detail over the adoption of ASU 2016-09. In December 2015, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service which resulted in $87.8 million of U.S. net operating losses being restored. The ruling created additional U.S. deferred tax assets and valuation allowance.\n\ufeff\nThe Company released $111.1 million of domestic valuation allowance during the year ended September 30, 2016. Approximately $25.1 million of the domestic valuation allowance release results from additional deferred tax assets created by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, effective as of October 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) which resulted in $87.8 million of U.S. net operating losses being restored and a release of $16.2 million of domestic valuation allowance from additional deferred tax assets created by the IRS ruling. The Company recorded tax expense of $3.1 million rlated to additional foreign valuation allowance during the year ended September 30, 2016.\n\ufeff\nOur effective tax rate was 22.7% for the year ended September 30, 2015 compared to 21.6% for the year ended September 30, 2014. Our estimated annual effective tax rate applied to these periods differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to income earned outside the U.S. that is subject to statutory rates lower than 35% and the release of valuation allowances on U.S. net operating losses deferred tax assets offsetting tax expense on U.S. pretax income. During the year ended September 30, 2015, we also recorded U.S. deferred income tax expense related to the change in book versus tax basis of indefinite-lived intangibles, which are amortized for tax purposes but not for book purposes. Additionally for the year ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $22.8 million for the reversal of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as a result of the AAG acquisition. For the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company also recognized $23.3 million of deferred tax assets related to its investment in one of its foreign subsidiaries, because that timing difference was expected to reverse in the foreseeable future, but due to the U.S. valuation allowance against deferred tax assets there was no net tax benefit for this item.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes,\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding income taxes.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSegment Financial Data\nGlobal Batteries & Appliances (GBA)\n\ufeff\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions, except %)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,010.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,092.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(81.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3.9%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,092.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,230.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(138.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(6.2%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>311.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>306.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>306.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>326.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(19.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(6.0%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>80 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\nbps\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\nbps\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nNet sales decreased $81.9 million, or 3.9%, during the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.

The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin is due to increased product costs due to product mix.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nHome & Garden (H&G)\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions, except %)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>509.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>474.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>35.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>474.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>431.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>42.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.7% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>138.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>124.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11.1% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>124.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>101.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>27.2% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>26.3% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>90 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\nbps\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>26.3% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23.6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>270 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\nbps\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nNet sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $35.0 million, or 7.4%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.

Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $42.1 million, or 9.7%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2014. The increase is attributable to increases in repellent products of $16.2 million, lawn and garden control products of $13.1 million and household insect control products of $12.8 million. The sales increase for all categories within home and garden was a result of distribution gains, strong point of sale activity driving replenishment orders at existing customer and market share gains on certain brands.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA in the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $13.8 million with an increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin of 90 bps compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Organic Net Sales are measures that are not prescribed by US GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Net Sales are further defined below, including reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measurement. As such, we encourage investors not to use these measures as substitutes for the determination of net income, net sales or other similar GAAP measures.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA. Our consolidated and segment results include financial information regarding Adjusted EBITDA ( Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization\u201d), which are non-GAAP earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and we believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments, excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items during each of the comparable periods and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of a company's ability to service debt and is one measure used for determining the Company's debt covenant. EBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company's income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes: (1) stock based compensation expense as it is a non-cash based compensation cost; (2) acquisition and integration costs that consist of transaction costs from acquisition transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business; (3) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives across the segments; (4) non-cash purchase accounting inventory adjustments\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrecognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (5) non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (6) and other adjustments. During the year ended September 30, 2016, other adjustments consisted of costs associated with the onboarding a key executive and the involuntary transfer of inventory. During the year ended September 30, 2015, other consisted of costs associated with the exiting of a key executive, coupled with onboarding a key executive, plus the Company recognized a non-recurring adjustment for the devaluation of cash and cash equivalents denominated in Venezuelan currency. During the year ended September 30, 2014, other consisted of costs associated with the existing of a key executive.\n\ufeff\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the

Our consolidated and segment results contain financial information regarding organic net sales, which we define as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and impact from acquisitions. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period's net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. The following is a reconciliation of reported net sales to organic net sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015, and the reported net sales to organic net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 respectively:\n\ufeff\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

None of the Company's current borrowings are subject to default or acceleration as a result of a downgrading of credit ratings, although a downgrade of the Company's credit ratings could increase fees and interest charges on future borrowings.\n\ufeff\nEquity\n\ufeff\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SBH granted 0.6 million, 0.6 million and 0.7 million restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), respectively, to our employees and our directors. All vesting dates are subject to the recipient's continued employment, except as otherwise permitted by our Compensation Committee or Board of Directors or in certain cases if the employee is terminated without cause or as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement. The total market value of the RSUs on the date of grant was for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $56.0 million, $52.9 million, and $50.5 million, respectively, which represented unearned share based compensation. Such unearned compensation is amortized to expense over the appropriate vesting period. See Note 16, Share Based Compensation\u201d of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2015, SBH issued 6.2 million shares of common stock in connection with the AAG acquisition, resulting in $562.7 million in proceeds, net of equity issuance costs.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time we may repurchase outstanding shares of SBH common stock in the open market or otherwise. On July 28, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a $300.0 million common stock repurchase program. The authorization is effective for 36 months. During the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SBH repurchased 450,087, 230,000 and 71,752 shares, respectively.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity Outlook\n\ufeff\nThe Company's ability to make principal and interest payments on borrowings under its U.S. and foreign credit facilities and its ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions. Based on its current level of operations, the Company believes that its existing cash balances and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the Company may request borrowings under its credit facilities and seek alternative forms of financing or additional investments to achieve its longer-term strategic plans.\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations & Other Commercial Commitments\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nContractual Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt, excluding capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,566.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>154.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>26.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>22.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,363.5 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest payments excluding capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,286.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>175.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>339.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>337.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>434.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>162.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>16.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>29.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>27.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>89.2 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>147.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>42.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>56.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>30.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEmployee benefit obligations(5)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>112.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>61.2 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Contractual Obligations(6)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,275.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>397.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>471.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>440.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,966.7 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 139: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSee Note 10 Debt\u201d, included elsewhere in the Annual Report.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest payments on debt subject to variable interest rates are based upon annualized interest rates as of September 30, 2016.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The following policies are considered by management to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The application of these accounting policies requires judgment and use of assumptions as to future events and outcomes that are uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for all relevant accounting policies.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\ufeff\nThe Company's goodwill, intangible assets and tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and amortization, less any provision for impairment. Intangible and tangible assets with determinable lives are amortized or depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about useful lives.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOn an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value to determine if potential goodwill impairment exists. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. See Note 19, Segment Information\u201d for further discussion of operating and reporting segments. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and its carrying value. The estimated fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we used a discounted cash flows methodology, which requires us to estimate future revenues, expenses, and capital expenditures and make assumptions about our weighted average cost of capital and perpetuity growth rate, among other variables. We test the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units by comparison to our total market capitalization, including both equity and debt capital. The fair value of GBA, HHI, PET, H&G, and GAC reporting units exceeded their carrying value by 157%, 110%, 58%, 326%, and 12%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to goodwill, the Company has indefinite-lived intangible assets that consist of acquired tradenames. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the identified trade names to the carrying value to determine if potential impairment exists. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined using an income approach, the relief-from-royalty methodology, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future revenues, royalty rates, and the discount rate, among others. During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $4.7 million impairment on indefinite life intangible assets due to the reduction in value of certain tradenames in response to changes in management's strategy.\n\ufeff\nThe Company also reviews other definite-lived intangible assets and tangible fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line, a sudden or consistent decline in the sales forecast for a product, changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used, a history of operating or cash flow losses or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others, may trigger an impairment review. If such indicators are present, the Company performs undiscounted cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. The asset value would be deemed impaired if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset did not exceed the carrying value of the asset. If impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. There were no triggering events identified during the year that necessitated an impairment test of definite-lived assets.\n\ufeff\nA considerable amount of judgment and assumptions is required in performing the impairment tests, principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and assets subject to impairment testing. While the Company believes its judgments and assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions could change the estimated fair value and therefore, additional impairment changes could be required. The Company is subject to financial statement risk in the event that business or economic conditions unexpectedly decline and impairment is realized.\n\ufeff\nPensions\n\ufeff\nThe Company recognizes amounts on the consolidated financial statements related to defined benefit pension plans using a September 30 measurement date. The accounting for these plans requires us to recognize the overfunded and/or underfunded status of each pension plan (i.e. the estimated present value of future benefits, net of plan assets) on the consolidated statement of financial position. A substantial portion of our pension obligations are related to defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., a majority of which are frozen. The determination of the estimated present value of future benefits includes several important assumptions, particularly around discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and retirement and mortality rates.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of high-quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of our plans' participants' demographics and benefit payment terms. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we used discount rates ranging from 1.00% to 13.50%. We believe the discount rates used are reflective of the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. If interest rates decline resulting in a lower discount rate, our pension liability, will increase along with the related pension expense and required funding contributions.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on our expectation of long-term average rates of return on assets in the pension funds, which reflect both the current and projected asset mix of the funds and consider the historical returns earned on the fund. If the actual rates of return are lower than we assume, our future pension expense and required funding contributions may increase. Actual returns above the assumed level could decrease future pension expense and lower the amount of required funding contributions. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00%. If plan assets decline due to poor market performance, our pension liability will increase along with increasing pension expense and required funding contributions may increase.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Based on the information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. See Note 13, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our employee benefit plans.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring and Related Charges\n\ufeff\nRestructuring charges include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs consisting primarily of one-time termination benefits such as severance costs and retention bonuses, and contract termination costs consisting primarily of lease termination costs. Related charges, as defined by us, include, but are not limited to, other costs directly associated with exit and relocation activities, including impairment of property and other assets, departmental costs of full-time incremental employees, and any other items related to the exit or relocation activities. Costs for such activities are estimated by us after evaluating detailed analyses of the costs to be incurred.\n\ufeff\nLiabilities from restructuring and related charges are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures, significant organizational adjustments and measures undertaken by us to exit certain activities. Costs for such activities are estimated by us after evaluating detailed analyses of the costs to be incurred. Such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits (including settlements of pension plans), impairment of property and equipment and other current or long term assets, lease termination payments and any other items directly related to the exit activities.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring and related charges associated with manufacturing and related initiatives are reported in cost of goods sold. Restructuring and related charges reflected in cost of goods sold include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs associated with manufacturing employees, asset impairments relating to manufacturing initiatives and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiatives implemented. Restructuring and related charges associated with administrative functions are reported in operating expenses, such as initiatives impacting sales, marketing, distribution or other non-manufacturing related functions. Restructuring and related charges reflected in operating expenses include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs, any asset impairments relating to the administrative functions and other costs directly related to the initiatives implemented.\n\ufeff\nWhile the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible, restructuring and related charges are estimates. Changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability may be required as we execute a restructuring plan. See Note 4, Restructuring and Related Charges\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a more complete discussion of our restructuring initiatives and related costs.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax liabilities for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts and circumstances and information available for reporting. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained upon conclusion of an examination, the Company has recorded a reserve based upon the largest amount of tax benefit having a cumulatively greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority assuming that it has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company did not recognize a reserve. As of September 30, 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, that if not recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in future periods was $50.6 million. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax reserves and changes to those reserves when considered appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution.\n\ufeff\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, net operating losses, tax credit, and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We base these estimates on projections of future income, including tax planning strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period we make that determination.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAs of September 30, 2016, we have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) of $758.9 million, with a federal tax benefit of $265.6 million and future tax benefits related to state NOLs of $60.6 million and capital loss carryforwards of $19.8 million with a federal and state tax benefit of $7.6 million. Our total valuation allowance for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized is $245.7 million at September 30, 2016. Of this amount, $203.7 million relates to U.S. net deferred tax assets and $42.0 million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets. We estimate that $197.8 million of valuation allowance related to domestic deferred tax assets cannot be released regardless of the amount of domestic operating income generated due to both prior period ownership changes that limit the amount of NOLs we can use and legal limitations on the use of capital losses and foreign tax credits.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we have provided $32.8 million of residual US taxes on earnings not yet taxed in the U.S. As of September 30, 2016, we project $3.4 million of additional tax expense from non-U.S. withholding and other taxes expected to be incurred on repatriation of foreign earnings.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere included in this Annual Report.\n\ufeff\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n\ufeff\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue recognition model requires identifying the contract and performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This ASU can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the updates recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends the previously issued ASU to provide for a one year deferral from the original effective date. As a result, the ASU will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, with early application only being available to us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. We are assessing the impact this pronouncement will have on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and have not determined the materiality or method of adoption.\n\ufeff\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC 840, Leases. This ASU requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Although the new ASU requires both operating and finance leases to be disclosed on the balance sheet, a distinction between the two types still exists as the economics of leases can vary. The ASU can be applied using a modified retrospective approach, with a number of optional practical expedients relating to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, along with the ability to use hindsight in the evaluation of lease decisions, that entities may elect to apply. As a result, the ASU will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, with early adoption applicable. We are assessing the impact this pronouncement will have on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and have not determined the materiality or method of adoption.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\ufeff\nThe following is management's discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

On September 20, 2016, we issued \u20ac425 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% unsecured notes due 2026 (the 4.00% Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the 4.00% Notes and draws on the Revolver were used to repay our outstanding 6.375% unsecured notes due 2020 (the 6.375% Notes\u201d) and pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing.

Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $249.6 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2015 primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and increase in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin increased from 35.6% to 38.1% contributed to by the AAG acquisition, and a shift towards higher margin product sales and continuing cost improvements across segments. Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $101.4 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 attributable to our increase in net sales. Gross profit margin increased from 35.4% to 35.6% primarily attributable to a shift towards higher margin product sales and cost improvement initiatives.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $67.5 million or 5.6% compared to the year ended September 30, 2015 primarily attributable to an increase in selling and general and administrative expenses of $89.4 million due to increased net sales, prior year acquisitions and increased share based compensation of $16.8 million; offset by decreased acquisition & integration related charges of $22.1 million and decreased restructuring and related charges of $11.9 million. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $109.2 million or 10.0% primarily attributable to an increase of $59.7 million in selling and general and administrative expenses as a result of acquisition activity and increased net sales, increased acquisition and integration costs of $38.7 million and increased restructuring and related charges of $7.4 million for new and continuing restructuring initiatives.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional detail on acquisition and integration costs. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Restructuring and Related Charges\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional detail on restructuring activity and related costs.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $21.9 million or 8.1% from the year ended September 30, 2015, attributable to the refinancing activity during the year ended September 30, 2015 previously discussed, coupled with payments on Term Loans; partially offset by $21.4 million of non-recurring costs due to refinancing activity during the year ended September 30, 2016, including (i) $15.6 million tendedr premium upon the repayment of 6.375% senior unsecured notes; and (iii) $5.8 million non-cash expense for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of 6.375% senior unsecured notes. Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $69.8 million or 34.5% from the year ended September 30, 2014, attributable to refinancing activity previously discussed, resulting in $58.8 million of non-recurring costs, including (i) $14.1 million for bridge financing commitments associated with the AAG acquisition, (ii) $4.5 million interest on assumed AAG senior notes from the date of the acquisition through payoff in June 2015, (iii) $16.9 million call premium upon the repayment of 6.75% senior unsecured notes; (iv) $4.1 million non-cash expense for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of 6.75% senior unsecured notes; (v) $10.4 million in fees associated with refinancing the then-existing senior term credit facility; and (vi) $8.8 million non-cash expense for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and discounts on the then-existing senior credit facility and ABL revolving loan facility. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 10.1% for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to 22.7% for the year ended September 30, 2015. Our estimated annual effective tax rate applied to these periods differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the release of valuation allowances on U.S. net operating losses deferred tax assets and income earned outside the U.S. that is subject to statutory rates lower than 35% offsetting tax expense on U.S. pretax income. Our effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2016 includes a $25.5 million expense to record a tax contingency reserve for a tax exposure in Germany. During the year, a local court ruled against our characterization of certain assets as amortizable under Germany tax law. We have appealed this ruling to the German Federal Court. While we continue to believe that our tax treatment was correct under the applicable German law, we have concluded that sufficient uncertainty on the ruling from the German Federal Court exists to record a full tax contingency for this exposure. Also included are $25.1 million of tax benefits, resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional discussion and detail over the adoption of ASU 2016-09. In December 2015, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service which resulted in $87.8 million of U.S. net operating losses being restored. The ruling created additional U.S. deferred tax assets and valuation allowance.\n\ufeff\nThe Company released $111.1 million of domestic valuation allowance during the year ended September 30, 2016. Approximately $25.1 million of the domestic valuation allowance release results from additional deferred tax assets created by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, effective as of October 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) which resulted in $87.8 million of U.S. net operating losses being restored and a release of $16.2 million of domestic valuation allowance from additional deferred tax assets created by the IRS ruling. The Company recorded tax expense of $3.1 million rlated to additional foreign valuation allowance during the year ended September 30, 2016.\n\ufeff\nOur effective tax rate was 22.7% for the year ended September 30, 2015 compared to 21.6% for the year ended September 30, 2014. Our estimated annual effective tax rate applied to these periods differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to income earned outside the U.S. that is subject to statutory rates lower than 35% and the release of valuation allowances on U.S. net operating losses deferred tax assets offsetting tax expense on U.S. pretax income. During the year ended September 30, 2015, we also recorded U.S. deferred income tax expense related to the change in book versus tax basis of indefinite-lived intangibles, which are amortized for tax purposes but not for book purposes. Additionally for the year ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $22.8 million for the reversal of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as a result of the AAG acquisition. For the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company also recognized $23.3 million of deferred tax assets related to its investment in one of its foreign subsidiaries, because that timing difference was expected to reverse in the foreseeable future, but due to the U.S. valuation allowance against deferred tax assets there was no net tax benefit for this item.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes,\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding income taxes.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSegment Financial Data\nGlobal Batteries & Appliances (GBA)\n\ufeff\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions, except %)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,010.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,092.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(81.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(3.9%) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,092.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>2,230.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(138.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(6.2%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>311.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>306.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>306.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>326.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(19.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(6.0%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>80 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\nbps\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14.6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>10 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\nbps\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nNet sales decreased $81.9 million, or 3.9%, during the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.

The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin is due to increased product costs due to product mix.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nHome & Garden (H&G)\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions, except %)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>509.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>474.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>35.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7.4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>474.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>431.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>42.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.7% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>138.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>124.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11.1% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>124.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>101.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>27.2% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>26.3% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>90 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\nbps\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>26.3% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23.6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>270 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\nbps\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nNet sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $35.0 million, or 7.4%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.

Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $42.1 million, or 9.7%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2014. The increase is attributable to increases in repellent products of $16.2 million, lawn and garden control products of $13.1 million and household insect control products of $12.8 million. The sales increase for all categories within home and garden was a result of distribution gains, strong point of sale activity driving replenishment orders at existing customer and market share gains on certain brands.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA in the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $13.8 million with an increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin of 90 bps compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Organic Net Sales are measures that are not prescribed by US GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Net Sales are further defined below, including reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measurement. As such, we encourage investors not to use these measures as substitutes for the determination of net income, net sales or other similar GAAP measures.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA. Our consolidated and segment results include financial information regarding Adjusted EBITDA ( Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization\u201d), which are non-GAAP earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and we believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments, excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items during each of the comparable periods and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of a company's ability to service debt and is one measure used for determining the Company's debt covenant. EBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company's income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes: (1) stock based compensation expense as it is a non-cash based compensation cost; (2) acquisition and integration costs that consist of transaction costs from acquisition transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business; (3) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives across the segments; (4) non-cash purchase accounting inventory adjustments\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrecognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (5) non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (6) and other adjustments. During the year ended September 30, 2016, other adjustments consisted of costs associated with the onboarding a key executive and the involuntary transfer of inventory. During the year ended September 30, 2015, other consisted of costs associated with the exiting of a key executive, coupled with onboarding a key executive, plus the Company recognized a non-recurring adjustment for the devaluation of cash and cash equivalents denominated in Venezuelan currency. During the year ended September 30, 2014, other consisted of costs associated with the existing of a key executive.\n\ufeff\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the

Our consolidated and segment results contain financial information regarding organic net sales, which we define as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and impact from acquisitions. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period's net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. The following is a reconciliation of reported net sales to organic net sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015, and the reported net sales to organic net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 respectively:\n\ufeff\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

None of the Company's current borrowings are subject to default or acceleration as a result of a downgrading of credit ratings, although a downgrade of the Company's credit ratings could increase fees and interest charges on future borrowings.\n\ufeff\nEquity\n\ufeff\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SBH granted 0.6 million, 0.6 million and 0.7 million restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), respectively, to our employees and our directors. All vesting dates are subject to the recipient's continued employment, except as otherwise permitted by our Compensation Committee or Board of Directors or in certain cases if the employee is terminated without cause or as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement. The total market value of the RSUs on the date of grant was for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $56.0 million, $52.9 million, and $50.5 million, respectively, which represented unearned share based compensation. Such unearned compensation is amortized to expense over the appropriate vesting period. See Note 16, Share Based Compensation\u201d of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2015, SBH issued 6.2 million shares of common stock in connection with the AAG acquisition, resulting in $562.7 million in proceeds, net of equity issuance costs.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time we may repurchase outstanding shares of SBH common stock in the open market or otherwise. On July 28, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a $300.0 million common stock repurchase program. The authorization is effective for 36 months. During the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SBH repurchased 450,087, 230,000 and 71,752 shares, respectively.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity Outlook\n\ufeff\nThe Company's ability to make principal and interest payments on borrowings under its U.S. and foreign credit facilities and its ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions. Based on its current level of operations, the Company believes that its existing cash balances and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the Company may request borrowings under its credit facilities and seek alternative forms of financing or additional investments to achieve its longer-term strategic plans.\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations & Other Commercial Commitments\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nContractual Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt, excluding capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,566.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>154.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>26.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>22.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,363.5 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest payments excluding capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,286.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>175.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>339.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>337.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>434.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>162.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>16.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>29.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>27.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>89.2 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>147.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>42.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>56.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>30.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>18.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEmployee benefit obligations(5)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>112.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>19.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>61.2 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Contractual Obligations(6)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>5,275.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>397.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>471.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>440.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,966.7 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n (1) See Note 10 Debt\u201d, included elsewhere in the Annual Report. \n (2) Interest payments on debt subject to variable interest rates are based upon annualized interest rates as of September 30, 2016.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The following policies are considered by management to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The application of these accounting policies requires judgment and use of assumptions as to future events and outcomes that are uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for all relevant accounting policies.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\ufeff\nThe Company's goodwill, intangible assets and tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and amortization, less any provision for impairment. Intangible and tangible assets with determinable lives are amortized or depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about useful lives.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOn an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value to determine if potential goodwill impairment exists. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. See Note 19, Segment Information\u201d for further discussion of operating and reporting segments. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and its carrying value. The estimated fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we used a discounted cash flows methodology, which requires us to estimate future revenues, expenses, and capital expenditures and make assumptions about our weighted average cost of capital and perpetuity growth rate, among other variables. We test the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units by comparison to our total market capitalization, including both equity and debt capital. The fair value of GBA, HHI, PET, H&G, and GAC reporting units exceeded their carrying value by 157%, 110%, 58%, 326%, and 12%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to goodwill, the Company has indefinite-lived intangible assets that consist of acquired tradenames. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the identified trade names to the carrying value to determine if potential impairment exists. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined using an income approach, the relief-from-royalty methodology, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future revenues, royalty rates, and the discount rate, among others. During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $4.7 million impairment on indefinite life intangible assets due to the reduction in value of certain tradenames in response to changes in management's strategy.\n\ufeff\nThe Company also reviews other definite-lived intangible assets and tangible fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line, a sudden or consistent decline in the sales forecast for a product, changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used, a history of operating or cash flow losses or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others, may trigger an impairment review. If such indicators are present, the Company performs undiscounted cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. The asset value would be deemed impaired if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset did not exceed the carrying value of the asset. If impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. There were no triggering events identified during the year that necessitated an impairment test of definite-lived assets.\n\ufeff\nA considerable amount of judgment and assumptions is required in performing the impairment tests, principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and assets subject to impairment testing. While the Company believes its judgments and assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions could change the estimated fair value and therefore, additional impairment changes could be required. The Company is subject to financial statement risk in the event that business or economic conditions unexpectedly decline and impairment is realized.\n\ufeff\nPensions\n\ufeff\nThe Company recognizes amounts on the consolidated financial statements related to defined benefit pension plans using a September 30 measurement date. The accounting for these plans requires us to recognize the overfunded and/or underfunded status of each pension plan (i.e. the estimated present value of future benefits, net of plan assets) on the consolidated statement of financial position. A substantial portion of our pension obligations are related to defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., a majority of which are frozen. The determination of the estimated present value of future benefits includes several important assumptions, particularly around discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and retirement and mortality rates.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of high-quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of our plans' participants' demographics and benefit payment terms. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we used discount rates ranging from 1.00% to 13.50%. We believe the discount rates used are reflective of the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. If interest rates decline resulting in a lower discount rate, our pension liability, will increase along with the related pension expense and required funding contributions.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on our expectation of long-term average rates of return on assets in the pension funds, which reflect both the current and projected asset mix of the funds and consider the historical returns earned on the fund. If the actual rates of return are lower than we assume, our future pension expense and required funding contributions may increase. Actual returns above the assumed level could decrease future pension expense and lower the amount of required funding contributions. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00%. If plan assets decline due to poor market performance, our pension liability will increase along with increasing pension expense and required funding contributions may increase.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Based on the information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. See Note 13, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our employee benefit plans.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring and Related Charges\n\ufeff\nRestructuring charges include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs consisting primarily of one-time termination benefits such as severance costs and retention bonuses, and contract termination costs consisting primarily of lease termination costs. Related charges, as defined by us, include, but are not limited to, other costs directly associated with exit and relocation activities, including impairment of property and other assets, departmental costs of full-time incremental employees, and any other items related to the exit or relocation activities. Costs for such activities are estimated by us after evaluating detailed analyses of the costs to be incurred.\n\ufeff\nLiabilities from restructuring and related charges are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures, significant organizational adjustments and measures undertaken by us to exit certain activities. Costs for such activities are estimated by us after evaluating detailed analyses of the costs to be incurred. Such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits (including settlements of pension plans), impairment of property and equipment and other current or long term assets, lease termination payments and any other items directly related to the exit activities.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring and related charges associated with manufacturing and related initiatives are reported in cost of goods sold. Restructuring and related charges reflected in cost of goods sold include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs associated with manufacturing employees, asset impairments relating to manufacturing initiatives and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiatives implemented. Restructuring and related charges associated with administrative functions are reported in operating expenses, such as initiatives impacting sales, marketing, distribution or other non-manufacturing related functions. Restructuring and related charges reflected in operating expenses include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs, any asset impairments relating to the administrative functions and other costs directly related to the initiatives implemented.\n\ufeff\nWhile the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible, restructuring and related charges are estimates. Changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability may be required as we execute a restructuring plan. See Note 4, Restructuring and Related Charges\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a more complete discussion of our restructuring initiatives and related costs.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax liabilities for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts and circumstances and information available for reporting. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained upon conclusion of an examination, the Company has recorded a reserve based upon the largest amount of tax benefit having a cumulatively greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority assuming that it has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company did not recognize a reserve. As of September 30, 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, that if not recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in future periods was $50.6 million. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax reserves and changes to those reserves when considered appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution.\n\ufeff\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, net operating losses, tax credit, and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We base these estimates on projections of future income, including tax planning strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period we make that determination.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAs of September 30, 2016, we have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) of $758.9 million, with a federal tax benefit of $265.6 million and future tax benefits related to state NOLs of $60.6 million and capital loss carryforwards of $19.8 million with a federal and state tax benefit of $7.6 million. Our total valuation allowance for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized is $245.7 million at September 30, 2016. Of this amount, $203.7 million relates to U.S. net deferred tax assets and $42.0 million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets. We estimate that $197.8 million of valuation allowance related to domestic deferred tax assets cannot be released regardless of the amount of domestic operating income generated due to both prior period ownership changes that limit the amount of NOLs we can use and legal limitations on the use of capital losses and foreign tax credits.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we have provided $32.8 million of residual US taxes on earnings not yet taxed in the U.S. As of September 30, 2016, we project $3.4 million of additional tax expense from non-U.S. withholding and other taxes expected to be incurred on repatriation of foreign earnings.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere included in this Annual Report.\n\ufeff\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n\ufeff\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue recognition model requires identifying the contract and performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This ASU can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the updates recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends the previously issued ASU to provide for a one year deferral from the original effective date. As a result, the ASU will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, with early application only being available to us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. We are assessing the impact this pronouncement will have on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and have not determined the materiality or method of adoption.\n\ufeff\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC 840, Leases. This ASU requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Although the new ASU requires both operating and finance leases to be disclosed on the balance sheet, a distinction between the two types still exists as the economics of leases can vary. The ASU can be applied using a modified retrospective approach, with a number of optional practical expedients relating to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, along with the ability to use hindsight in the evaluation of lease decisions, that entities may elect to apply. As a result, the ASU will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, with early adoption applicable. We are assessing the impact this pronouncement will have on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and have not determined the materiality or method of adoption.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\ufeff\nThe following is management's discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

See Note 10, Debt\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional detail regarding debt.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we refinanced a portion of our debt to extend maturities and reduce borrowing costs. On September 20, 2016, we issued \u20ac425 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% unsecured notes due 2026 (the 4.00% Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the 4.00% Notes and draws on the Revolver were used to repay our outstanding 6.375% unsecured notes due 2020 (the 6.375% Notes\u201d) and pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing.

On May 20, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of AAG, we issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% unsecured notes due 2025 (the 5.75% Notes\u201d). On June 23, 2015, we entered into term loan facilities pursuant to a Senior Credit Agreement consisting of (i) a $1,450 million USD Term Loan due June 23, 2022, (ii) a $75 million CAD Term Loan due June 23, 2022 and (iii) a \u20ac300 million Euro Term Loan due June 23, 2022, (collectively, Term Loans\u201d) and (iv) entered into a $500 million Revolver Facility due June 23, 2020 (the Revolver\u201d). The proceeds from the Term Loans and draws on the Revolver were used to repay our then-existing senior term credit facility, repay our outstanding 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2020, repay and replace our then-existing asset based revolving loan ( ABL\u201d) facility and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, on December 3, 2014, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.12% unsecured notes due 2024 (the 6.125% Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the 6.125% Notes were used to fund acquisition activity, pay fees and expenses in connection with the financing and general corporate purposes.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2014, the Company amended its then-existing senior term credit facility, issuing two tranches maturing September 4, 2019 which provide for borrowings in the principal amounts of $215.0 million and \u20ac225.0 million.

The $215.0 million U.S. dollar denominated portion was combined with the then-existing Tranche C maturing September 4, 2019. These loans were refinanced during the year ended September 30, 2015 as described above.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following is summarized consolidated results of operations for SBH for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nNet Sales. Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $349.3 million, or 7.4%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. Organic net sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $123.7 million, or 2.6%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $261.3 million, or 5.9%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2014. Organic net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $91.1 million, or 2.1%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2014. Organic net sales excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions, and is considered a non-GAAP measurement. See Non-GAAP Measurements\u201d section included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of Net Sales to organic net sales. The following sets forth net sales by segment for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThe following sets forth the principal components of change in net sales from the year ended September 30, 2016 to the year ended September 30, 2015, and from the year ended September 30, 2015 to the year ended September 30, 2014:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nGross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $249.6 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2015 primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and increase in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin increased from 35.6% to 38.1% contributed to by the AAG acquisition, and a shift towards higher margin product sales and continuing cost improvements across segments. Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $101.4 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 attributable to our increase in net sales. Gross profit margin increased from 35.4% to 35.6% primarily attributable to a shift towards higher margin product sales and cost improvement initiatives.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $67.5 million or 5.6% compared to the year ended September 30, 2015 primarily attributable to an increase in selling and general and administrative expenses of $89.4 million due to increased net sales, prior year acquisitions and increased share based compensation of $16.8 million; offset by decreased acquisition & integration related charges of $22.1 million and decreased restructuring and related charges of $11.9 million. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $109.2 million or 10.0% primarily attributable to an increase of $59.7 million in selling and general and administrative expenses as a result of acquisition activity and increased net sales, increased acquisition and integration costs of $38.7 million and increased restructuring and related charges of $7.4 million for new and continuing restructuring initiatives.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional detail on acquisition and integration costs. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Restructuring and Related Charges\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional detail on restructuring activity and related costs.\n\ufeff\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $21.9 million or 8.1% from the year ended September 30, 2015, attributable to the refinancing activity during the year ended September 30, 2015 previously discussed, coupled with payments on Term Loans; partially offset by $21.4 million of non-recurring costs due to refinancing activity during the year ended September 30, 2016, including (i) $15.6 million tendedr premium upon the repayment of 6.375% senior unsecured notes; and (iii) $5.8 million non-cash expense for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of 6.375% senior unsecured notes. Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $69.8 million or 34.5% from the year ended September 30, 2014, attributable to refinancing activity previously discussed, resulting in $58.8 million of non-recurring costs, including (i) $14.1 million for bridge financing commitments associated with the AAG acquisition, (ii) $4.5 million interest on assumed AAG senior notes from the date of the acquisition through payoff in June 2015, (iii) $16.9 million call premium upon the repayment of 6.75% senior unsecured notes; (iv) $4.1 million non-cash expense for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of 6.75% senior unsecured notes; (v) $10.4 million in fees associated with refinancing the then-existing senior term credit facility; and (vi) $8.8 million non-cash expense for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and discounts on the then-existing senior credit facility and ABL revolving loan facility. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt\u201d, included elsewhere within this Annual Report, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 10.1% for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to 22.7% for the year ended September 30, 2015. Our estimated annual effective tax rate applied to these periods differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the release of valuation allowances on U.S. net operating losses deferred tax assets and income earned outside the U.S. that is subject to statutory rates lower than 35% offsetting tax expense on U.S. pretax income. Our effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2016 includes a $25.5 million expense to record a tax contingency reserve for a tax exposure in Germany. During the year, a local court ruled against our characterization of certain assets as amortizable under Germany tax law. We have appealed this ruling to the German Federal Court. While we continue to believe that our tax treatment was correct under the applicable German law, we have concluded that sufficient uncertainty on the ruling from the German Federal Court exists to record a full tax contingency for this exposure. Also included are $25.1 million of tax benefits, resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional discussion and detail over the adoption of ASU 2016-09. In December 2015, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service which resulted in $87.8 million of U.S. net operating losses being restored. The ruling created additional U.S. deferred tax assets and valuation allowance.\n\ufeff\nThe Company released $111.1 million of domestic valuation allowance during the year ended September 30, 2016. Approximately $25.1 million of the domestic valuation allowance release results from additional deferred tax assets created by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, effective as of October 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) which resulted in $87.8 million of U.S. net operating losses being restored and a release of $16.2 million of domestic valuation allowance from additional deferred tax assets created by the IRS ruling. The Company recorded tax expense of $3.1 million rlated to additional foreign valuation allowance during the year ended September 30, 2016.\n\ufeff\nOur effective tax rate was 22.7% for the year ended September 30, 2015 compared to 21.6% for the year ended September 30, 2014. Our estimated annual effective tax rate applied to these periods differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to income earned outside the U.S. that is subject to statutory rates lower than 35% and the release of valuation allowances on U.S. net operating losses deferred tax assets offsetting tax expense on U.S. pretax income. During the year ended September 30, 2015, we also recorded U.S. deferred income tax expense related to the change in book versus tax basis of indefinite-lived intangibles, which are amortized for tax purposes but not for book purposes. Additionally for the year ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $22.8 million for the reversal of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as a result of the AAG acquisition. For the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company also recognized $23.3 million of deferred tax assets related to its investment in one of its foreign subsidiaries, because that timing difference was expected to reverse in the foreseeable future, but due to the U.S. valuation allowance against deferred tax assets there was no net tax benefit for this item.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes,\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding income taxes.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSegment Financial Data\nGlobal Batteries & Appliances (GBA)\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nNet sales decreased $81.9 million, or 3.9%, during the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.

Personal care organic net sales increased $35.5 million, or 6.5%, for the year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the year ended September 30, 2014; driven by increased sales in North America of $11.6 million as a result of display location changes at a major customer, promotional activity and continued growth in e-commerce; increased Europe sales of $16.6 million due to new product sales and expansion in Eastern European markets; and increased Latin America sales of $5.3 million from growth in Mexico, new customers and effective promotional sales within the region.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA in the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $4.5 million and the Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 80 bps compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to the increase in net sales discussed above, cost improvement and better product mix, offset by negative foreign currency impact of $76.5 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin is due to improved product mix and cost improvements. Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $19.7 million and the Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 10 bps compared to the year ended September 30, 2014. Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to decreased sales discussed above, which was partially offset by cost improvements and favorable product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased due to cost improvements and product mix. See Non-GAAP Measurements for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA by segment.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nHardware & Home Improvement (HHI)\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nNet sales increased $35.5 million, or 2.9%, for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. Organic net sales increased $50.2 million, or 4.2%, attributable to increases in the security product category of $40.0 million from an increase in point of sale, new product listings with key retail customers, increases in e-commerce volumes, and market growth with non-retail customers, partially offset by a $5.5 million decrease in sales with private label customers due to the transition in production of higher-margin branded product; an increase in plumbing products of $14.7 million from the introduction of new products and promotional volumes with key retail customers; partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease in hardware products driven by a $22.8 million decrease for the expiration of a customer tolling agreement and planned exit of unprofitable businesses, mitigated by volume growth at existing retail and market expansion with non-retail customers in North America. Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $39.5 million, or 3.4%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2014. Organic net sales increased $20.7 million, or 1.8%, due to an increase in North America sales as a result of higher domestic security and plumbing sales from retailers due to customer gains and from non-retailers through pricing and market growth, offset by a decrease in sales in APAC of $14.2 million driven by the exit of low margin products and the expiration of a customer tolling agreement.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA in the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $16.1 million while Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 80 bps from the year ended September, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to the increase in net sales discussed above and cost improvements.

Organic net sales increased $1.2 million, 0.2%, primarily due to increases in aquatic sales of $1.1 million from timing of prior year holiday shipments, partially offset with the exit of lower margin business; while companion animal and pet food sales were consistent to prior year due to increased competition at key retailers, offset by growth with independent pet retailers, timing of promotional activity, and exiting of certain private label business. Net sales increased $157.7 million, or 26.3%, for the year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the year ended September 30, 2014, including $200.1 million of acquisition sales.

Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 relate to the acquired AAG business subsequent to the acquisition date of May 21, 2015.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased $106.1 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. For the period of May 21, 2016 through September 30, 2016, Adjusted EBITDA increased $10.5 million, or 22%, compared to the period of May 21, 2015 through September 30, 2015, primarily due to increases in net sales discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 430bps due to reduced operating expenses and cost improvements from post integration synergies.\n\ufeff\nNon-GAAP Measurements\n\ufeff\nWhile management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace the Company's GAAP financial results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Organic Net Sales are measures that are not prescribed by US GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Net Sales are further defined below, including reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measurement. As such, we encourage investors not to use these measures as substitutes for the determination of net income, net sales or other similar GAAP measures.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA. Our consolidated and segment results include financial information regarding Adjusted EBITDA ( Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization\u201d), which are non-GAAP earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and we believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments, excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items during each of the comparable periods and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of a company's ability to service debt and is one measure used for determining the Company's debt covenant. EBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company's income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes: (1) stock based compensation expense as it is a non-cash based compensation cost; (2) acquisition and integration costs that consist of transaction costs from acquisition transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business; (3) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives across the segments; (4) non-cash purchase accounting inventory adjustments\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrecognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (5) non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (6) and other adjustments. During the year ended September 30, 2016, other adjustments consisted of costs associated with the onboarding a key executive and the involuntary transfer of inventory. During the year ended September 30, 2015, other consisted of costs associated with the exiting of a key executive, coupled with onboarding a key executive, plus the Company recognized a non-recurring adjustment for the devaluation of cash and cash equivalents denominated in Venezuelan currency. During the year ended September 30, 2014, other consisted of costs associated with the existing of a key executive.\n\ufeff\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for SBH:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for SB/RH:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOrganic Net Sales. Our consolidated and segment results contain financial information regarding organic net sales, which we define as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and impact from acquisitions. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period's net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. The following is a reconciliation of reported net sales to organic net sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015, and the reported net sales to organic net sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 respectively:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nThe following is a summary of the Company's cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nSpectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\ufeff\nThe $170.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to (i) incremental cash generated from the segment operations of $166.7 million due to growth in net sales, acquisitions and cost management initiatives; including cash contributed through working capital primarily from decreases of receivables and inventory through working capital management initiatives; (ii) decrease in cash paid for interest of $12.0 million, excluding a non-recurring tender premium of $15.6 million for the redemption of 6.375% Note, from decrease in annualized interest costs;

(ii) repayment of $764.9 million under the former senior credit facilities and $6.0 million of other debt; (iii) dividend payments to SBH of $77.0 million; (iv) payment of share-based tax withholdings of employees for vested stock awards of $25.0 million; and (v) payment of debt issuance costs of $5.4 million.\n\ufeff\nCapital Expenditures\n\ufeff\nCapital expenditures for the Company totaled $95.2 million, $89.1 million and $73.3 million for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We expect to make investments in capital projects similar to historical levels, as well as incremental investments slightly above historical levels related to acquisitions and in high return cost reduction projects.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\ufeff\nDepreciation and amortization for the Company totaled $183.0 million, $170.0 million and $157.6 million for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is due to the recognition of property, plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets from the acquisitions of AAG, European IAMS and Eukanuba, and Salix during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, as previously discussed.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIndebtedness\n\ufeff\nRefer to Note 10, Debt\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the outstanding principal on our debt obligations, we have annual interest payment obligations of $170.1 million in the aggregate. This includes interest under our: (i) 4.00% Notes of approximately $19.1 million; (ii) 6.625% Notes of approximately $37.8 million (iii) 6.125% Notes of approximately $15.3 million; (iv) 5.75% Notes of $57.5 million and (iv) Term Loans of $40.4 million. Interest on the 4.00% Notes, the 6.625% Notes and the 6.75% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears and interest under the Term Loan and the Revolver Facility is payable on various interest payment dates as provided in the Senior Credit Agreement. We are required to pay certain fees in connection with our outstanding debt obligations including a quarterly commitment fee of up to 0.50% on the unused portion of the Revolver Facility and certain additional fees with respect to the letter of credit sub-facility under the Revolver Facility.\n\ufeff\nAt September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes. See Risk Factors\u201d, for further discussion of the risks associated with our ability to service all of our existing indebtedness and maintain compliance with financial and other covenants related to such indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nCredit Ratings\n\ufeff\nThe Company's access to the capital markets and financing costs in those markets may depend on the credit ratings of the Company when it is accessing the capital markets. None of the Company's current borrowings are subject to default or acceleration as a result of a downgrading of credit ratings, although a downgrade of the Company's credit ratings could increase fees and interest charges on future borrowings.\n\ufeff\nEquity\n\ufeff\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SBH granted 0.6 million, 0.6 million and 0.7 million restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), respectively, to our employees and our directors. All vesting dates are subject to the recipient's continued employment, except as otherwise permitted by our Compensation Committee or Board of Directors or in certain cases if the employee is terminated without cause or as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement. The total market value of the RSUs on the date of grant was for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $56.0 million, $52.9 million, and $50.5 million, respectively, which represented unearned share based compensation. Such unearned compensation is amortized to expense over the appropriate vesting period. See Note 16, Share Based Compensation\u201d of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2015, SBH issued 6.2 million shares of common stock in connection with the AAG acquisition, resulting in $562.7 million in proceeds, net of equity issuance costs.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time we may repurchase outstanding shares of SBH common stock in the open market or otherwise. On July 28, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a $300.0 million common stock repurchase program. The authorization is effective for 36 months. During the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SBH repurchased 450,087, 230,000 and 71,752 shares, respectively.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity Outlook\n\ufeff\nThe Company's ability to make principal and interest payments on borrowings under its U.S. and foreign credit facilities and its ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions. Based on its current level of operations, the Company believes that its existing cash balances and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the Company may request borrowings under its credit facilities and seek alternative forms of financing or additional investments to achieve its longer-term strategic plans.\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nContractual Obligations & Other Commercial Commitments\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\n\n\ufeff\n (1) See Note 10 Debt\u201d, included elsewhere in the Annual Report. \n (2) Interest payments on debt subject to variable interest rates are based upon annualized interest rates as of September 30, 2016. See Note 10, Debt\u201d, included elsewhere in the Annual Report. \n (3) Capital lease payments due by fiscal year include executory costs and imputed interest not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. See Note 10 Debt\u201d, included elsewhere in the Annual Report. \n (4) Operating lease payments due by fiscal year not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. See Note 11 Leases\u201d, included elsewhere in the Annual Report. \n (5) Employee benefit obligations represent the sum of our estimated future minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit plans based on actuarially determined estimates and projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement plans. See Note 13 Employee Benefit Plans\u201d, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n (6) At September 30, 2016, our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. However, it is not possible to predict or estimate the timing of payments for these obligations. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of income tax audits currently in progress for certain of our companies; however, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months, some portion of our unrecognized tax benefits could be recognized. See Note 14 Income Taxes\u201d, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \nThe following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of September 30, 2016, consisting entirely of standby letters of credit that back the performance of certain of our entities under various credit facilities, insurance policies and lease arrangements:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\ufeff\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The following policies are considered by management to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The application of these accounting policies requires judgment and use of assumptions as to future events and outcomes that are uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for all relevant accounting policies.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\ufeff\nThe Company's goodwill, intangible assets and tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and amortization, less any provision for impairment. Intangible and tangible assets with determinable lives are amortized or depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Practices\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about useful lives.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOn an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value to determine if potential goodwill impairment exists. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. See Note 19, Segment Information\u201d for further discussion of operating and reporting segments. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and its carrying value. The estimated fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we used a discounted cash flows methodology, which requires us to estimate future revenues, expenses, and capital expenditures and make assumptions about our weighted average cost of capital and perpetuity growth rate, among other variables. We test the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units by comparison to our total market capitalization, including both equity and debt capital. The fair value of GBA, HHI, PET, H&G, and GAC reporting units exceeded their carrying value by 157%, 110%, 58%, 326%, and 12%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to goodwill, the Company has indefinite-lived intangible assets that consist of acquired tradenames. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the identified trade names to the carrying value to determine if potential impairment exists. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined using an income approach, the relief-from-royalty methodology, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future revenues, royalty rates, and the discount rate, among others. During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $4.7 million impairment on indefinite life intangible assets due to the reduction in value of certain tradenames in response to changes in management's strategy.\n\ufeff\nThe Company also reviews other definite-lived intangible assets and tangible fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line, a sudden or consistent decline in the sales forecast for a product, changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used, a history of operating or cash flow losses or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others, may trigger an impairment review. If such indicators are present, the Company performs undiscounted cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. The asset value would be deemed impaired if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset did not exceed the carrying value of the asset. If impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. There were no triggering events identified during the year that necessitated an impairment test of definite-lived assets.\n\ufeff\nA considerable amount of judgment and assumptions is required in performing the impairment tests, principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and assets subject to impairment testing. While the Company believes its judgments and assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions could change the estimated fair value and therefore, additional impairment changes could be required. The Company is subject to financial statement risk in the event that business or economic conditions unexpectedly decline and impairment is realized.\n\ufeff\nPensions\n\ufeff\nThe Company recognizes amounts on the consolidated financial statements related to defined benefit pension plans using a September 30 measurement date. The accounting for these plans requires us to recognize the overfunded and/or underfunded status of each pension plan (i.e. the estimated present value of future benefits, net of plan assets) on the consolidated statement of financial position. A substantial portion of our pension obligations are related to defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., a majority of which are frozen. The determination of the estimated present value of future benefits includes several important assumptions, particularly around discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and retirement and mortality rates.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of high-quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of our plans' participants' demographics and benefit payment terms. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we used discount rates ranging from 1.00% to 13.50%. We believe the discount rates used are reflective of the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. If interest rates decline resulting in a lower discount rate, our pension liability, will increase along with the related pension expense and required funding contributions.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on our expectation of long-term average rates of return on assets in the pension funds, which reflect both the current and projected asset mix of the funds and consider the historical returns earned on the fund. If the actual rates of return are lower than we assume, our future pension expense and required funding contributions may increase. Actual returns above the assumed level could decrease future pension expense and lower the amount of required funding contributions. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00%. If plan assets decline due to poor market performance, our pension liability will increase along with increasing pension expense and required funding contributions may increase.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Based on the information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. See Note 13, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our employee benefit plans.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring and Related Charges\n\ufeff\nRestructuring charges include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs consisting primarily of one-time termination benefits such as severance costs and retention bonuses, and contract termination costs consisting primarily of lease termination costs. Related charges, as defined by us, include, but are not limited to, other costs directly associated with exit and relocation activities, including impairment of property and other assets, departmental costs of full-time incremental employees, and any other items related to the exit or relocation activities. Costs for such activities are estimated by us after evaluating detailed analyses of the costs to be incurred.\n\ufeff\nLiabilities from restructuring and related charges are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures, significant organizational adjustments and measures undertaken by us to exit certain activities. Costs for such activities are estimated by us after evaluating detailed analyses of the costs to be incurred. Such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits (including settlements of pension plans), impairment of property and equipment and other current or long term assets, lease termination payments and any other items directly related to the exit activities.\n\ufeff\nRestructuring and related charges associated with manufacturing and related initiatives are reported in cost of goods sold. Restructuring and related charges reflected in cost of goods sold include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs associated with manufacturing employees, asset impairments relating to manufacturing initiatives and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiatives implemented. Restructuring and related charges associated with administrative functions are reported in operating expenses, such as initiatives impacting sales, marketing, distribution or other non-manufacturing related functions. Restructuring and related charges reflected in operating expenses include, but are not limited to, termination and related costs, any asset impairments relating to the administrative functions and other costs directly related to the initiatives implemented.\n\ufeff\nWhile the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible, restructuring and related charges are estimates. Changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability may be required as we execute a restructuring plan. See Note 4, Restructuring and Related Charges\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a more complete discussion of our restructuring initiatives and related costs.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax liabilities for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts and circumstances and information available for reporting. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained upon conclusion of an examination, the Company has recorded a reserve based upon the largest amount of tax benefit having a cumulatively greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority assuming that it has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company did not recognize a reserve. As of September 30, 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, that if not recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in future periods was $50.6 million. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of income tax reserves and changes to those reserves when considered appropriate. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is finally resolved. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash or a reduction in our net operating loss carryforwards. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective rate in the year of resolution.\n\ufeff\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, net operating losses, tax credit, and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We base these estimates on projections of future income, including tax planning strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period we make that determination.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAs of September 30, 2016, we have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) of $758.9 million, with a federal tax benefit of $265.6 million and future tax benefits related to state NOLs of $60.6 million and capital loss carryforwards of $19.8 million with a federal and state tax benefit of $7.6 million. Our total valuation allowance for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized is $245.7 million at September 30, 2016. Of this amount, $203.7 million relates to U.S. net deferred tax assets and $42.0 million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets. We estimate that $197.8 million of valuation allowance related to domestic deferred tax assets cannot be released regardless of the amount of domestic operating income generated due to both prior period ownership changes that limit the amount of NOLs we can use and legal limitations on the use of capital losses and foreign tax credits.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we have provided $32.8 million of residual US taxes on earnings not yet taxed in the U.S. As of September 30, 2016, we project $3.4 million of additional tax expense from non-U.S. withholding and other taxes expected to be incurred on repatriation of foreign earnings.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere included in this Annual Report.\n\ufeff\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n\ufeff\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue recognition model requires identifying the contract and performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This ASU can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the updates recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends the previously issued ASU to provide for a one year deferral from the original effective date. As a result, the ASU will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, with early application only being available to us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. We are assessing the impact this pronouncement will have on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and have not determined the materiality or method of adoption.\n\ufeff\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC 840, Leases. This ASU requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Although the new ASU requires both operating and finance leases to be disclosed on the balance sheet, a distinction between the two types still exists as the economics of leases can vary. The ASU can be applied using a modified retrospective approach, with a number of optional practical expedients relating to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, along with the ability to use hindsight in the evaluation of lease decisions, that entities may elect to apply. As a result, the ASU will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, with early adoption applicable. We are assessing the impact this pronouncement will have on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and have not determined the materiality or method of adoption.", "item_7_tables":

increased 7.4% and 5.9% for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively, primarily driven by acquisitions. Organic net sales, excluding acquisitions and foreign currency impacts, increased 2.6% and 2.1% for those periods.\n\n- Gross profit also increased in both periods due to higher sales and improved gross margins from better product mix and cost improvements. \n\n- Operating expenses increased mainly due to higher SG&A from acquisitions, higher compensation costs, and additional investments. These were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.\n\n- Interest expense decreased in 2016 due to debt refinancing activity, but increased significantly in 2015 due to one-time fees and charges associated with financing acquisitions.\n\n- Net income increased 139.4% in 2016 but declined 30.3% in 2015, largely driven by the non-recurring costs in 2015 for restructuring, acquisitions, and debt refinancing.\n\nFinancial Position\n- Operating cash flows increased by $170.7 million in 2016 primarily from higher net income and working capital improvements. Investing cash flows decreased significantly as 2015 included payments for major acquisitions.\n\n- Debt refinancing activity in both years aimed to reduce interest costs and extend maturities. Total debt was $3.6 billion at September 30, 2016.\n\n- $245.7 million tax valuation allowance remains against deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016.\n\n- Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were tested for impairment. A $4.7 million charge was recorded in 2016 for reducing the value of certain trademarks.\n\nOutlook\n- The company expects continued solid operating cash flows based on current operations and working capital management. Additional investments and growth initiatives may require additional financing.\n\n- $95.2 million was invested in capital projects in 2016, with expectations for similar future spending levels.\n\nDoes this help summarize the key points from the report?
