Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our present business and the results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Report.\nExecutive Overview\nIntroduction\nIcahn Enterprises L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises\u201d) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises Holdings\u201d) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. References to \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nIcahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Icahn Enterprises and conduct substantially all of its operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to allocations to the general and limited partners. We do not discuss Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings separately unless we believe it is necessary to an understanding of the businesses.\nWe are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses: Investment, Energy, Automotive, Food Packaging, Metals, Real Estate, Home Fashion and Mining. We also report the results of our Holding Company, which includes the results of certain subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings (unless otherwise noted), and investment activity and expenses associated with our Holding Company. Our historical results also report the results of our Railcar segment through the date we sold our last remaining railcars on lease, which occurred in the third quarter of 2018.\nSignificant Transactions and Developments\nSignificant transactions and developments affecting our results of operations and liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2018 are summarized as follows:\nSale of Discontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we closed on the sales of Federal-Mogul LLC (\"Federal-Mogul\"), Tropicana Entertainment Inc. (\"Tropicana\") and American Railcar Industries, Inc. (\"ARI\"). As a result of the transactions, our Holding Company received approximately $3.2 billion in aggregate cash proceeds and approximately $1.2 billion of fair value equity in Tenneco, Inc., resulting in the recognition of aggregate pre-tax gains on the sales of discontinued operations attributable to Icahn Enterprises of approximately $1.4 billion.\nPending Sale of Ferrous Resources. On December 5, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Ferrous Resources Ltd. for total consideration of $550 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Financial Results\nOur operating businesses comprise consolidated subsidiaries which operate in various industries and are managed on a decentralized basis. Revenues for our continuing operating businesses primarily consist of net sales of various products, services revenue, franchisor operations and leasing of real estate. Due to the structure and nature of our business, we primarily discuss the results of operations by individual reporting segment in order to better understand our consolidated operating performance. Certain other financial information is discussed on a consolidated basis following our segment discussion, including other revenues and expenses included in continuing operations as well as our results from discontinued operations. In addition to the summarized financial results below, refer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of each of our reporting segment's results of continuing operations to our consolidated results.\nThe comparability of our summarized consolidated financial results presented below is affected by, among other factors, (i) the performance of the Investment Funds, (ii) the results of our Energy segment's operations, impacted by the relationship of its refined product prices and prices for crude oil and other feedstocks, (iii) impairment charges, primarily in our Automotive segment in 2018 and our Energy segment in 2016, (iv) acquisitions of businesses, primarily in our Automotive segment during 2017 and 2016, (v) gains on dispositions of assets, primarily in our Railcar and Real Estate segments in 2017, including the impact of the disposed income generating assets on subsequent operations, (vi) our Holding Company's unrealized equity investment gains and losses and (vii) the enactment of tax legislation in the United States in 2017. Refer to our respective segment discussions and \"Other Consolidated Results of Operations,\" below for further discussion.

various private investment funds (the \"Investment Funds\"). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $5.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total fair market value of investments in the Investment Funds made by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (excluding us) was approximately $5.0 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.\nOur Investment segment's results of operations are reflected in net income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Investment segment's net income (loss) is driven by the amount of funds allocated to the Investment Funds and the performance of the underlying investments in the Investment Funds. Future funds allocated to the Investment Funds may increase or decrease based on the contributions and redemptions by our Holding Company and by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates. Additionally, historical performance results of the Investment Funds are not indicative of future results as past market\nconditions, investment opportunities and investment decisions may not occur in the future. Changes in general market conditions coupled with changes in exposure to short and long positions have significant impact on our Investment segment's results of operations and the comparability of results of operations year over year and as such, future results of operations will be impacted by our future exposures and future market conditions, which may not be consistent with prior trends. Refer to the \"Investment Segment Liquidity\" section of our \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" discussion for additional information regarding our Investment segment's exposure as of December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Investment Funds' returns were 7.9%, 2.1% and (20.3)%, respectively. Our Investment Funds' returns represent a weighted-average composite of the average returns, net of expenses. The following table sets forth the performance attribution for the Investment Funds' returns:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long positions\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short positions\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents net income (loss) for our Investment segment:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long positions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short positions\n</td> <td>931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,787\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,894\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,487\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nFor 2018, the Investment Funds' positive performance was driven by net gains in their short positions offset in part by net losses in their long positions. The positive performance of our Investment segment's short positions was driven by the positive performance of broad market hedges of $642 million and the aggregate performance of multiple other short positions with net gains across various sectors, primarily the energy sector. The negative performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by losses from two consumer, cyclical sector investments, a basic material sector investment, two consumer, non-cyclical sector investments, a technology sector investment and an industrial sector investment with losses aggregating approximately $1.4 billion. The aggregate performance of investments with net losses across various other sectors accounted for an additional negative performance of our Investment segment's long positions. Losses in long positions were offset in part by gains from a consumer, non-cyclical sector investment, a technology sector investment and an energy sector investment with gains aggregating approximately $1.3 billion.\nFor 2017, the Investment Funds' positive performance was driven by net gains in their long positions, offset in part by net losses in their short positions. The positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by gains from two consumer, non-cyclical sector investments, a basic materials sector investment, an energy sector investment and a consumer, cyclical sector investment aggregating approximately $1.6 billion. The aggregate performance of investments with gains across various other sectors accounted for the additional positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions, offset in part by the aggregate performance of investments with losses in the financial sector. Losses in short positions were attributable to the negative performance of broad market hedges of approximately $2.1 billion and the negative performance of various other short positions across multiple sectors. Losses in short positions were offset in part by the positive performance of three consumer, cyclical sector short positions aggregating $627 million.\nFor 2016, the Investment Funds' negative performance was driven by net losses in their short positions, offset in part by net gains in their long positions. Losses in short positions were attributable to the negative performance of broad market hedges of approximately $1.5 billion, as well as the negative performance of other short positions, primarily in the consumer, cyclical sector. The positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by gains from a certain basic materials sector investment of $561 million. The aggregate performance of investments with gains across various other sectors were offset by the aggregate performance of investments with losses primarily in the technology and consumer non-cyclical sectors.\nEnergy\nOur Energy segment is primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing businesses. The sale of petroleum products accounted for approximately 95%, 94% and 93% of our Energy segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe results of operations of the petroleum business are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks that are processed and blended into petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel, that are produced by a refinery (\"refined products\"). The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond our Energy segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as gasoline and other refined products. This supply and demand depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum business applies first-in, first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact gross margin in the short-term fluctuations in the market price of inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the petroleum business' results of operations is influenced by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which requires it to either blend renewable fuels\u201d in with its transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and the future cost of RINs for the petroleum business is difficult to estimate. Additionally, the cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of the petroleum business' petroleum products, as well as the fuel blending performed at its refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Refer to Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of RINs.\nThe following table presents our Energy segment's net sales, cost of goods sold and gross margin:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>6,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.1 billion (19%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of an increase in refined products crack spreads, partially offset by decreased sales volumes. Our nitrogen fertilizer business' net sales increased over the comparable periods due to higher sales prices and volumes.\nCost of goods sold for our Energy segment increased by $654 million (11%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of a higher cost of consumed crude oil offset in part by a decrease in RINs costs. The increase in consumed crude oil costs was due to an increase in crude oil prices, offset in part by a decrease in consumed crude volume. The net cost of RINs was favorably impacted by a reduction in the petroleum segment's RFS obligation and reduced market pricing.\nGross margin for our Energy segment increased by $482 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 9% and 3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with an increase attributable to our petroleum business. The increase in the gross margin as a percentage of net sales for our petroleum business was primarily due to higher gross margins per barrel resulting from a higher refined product crack spreads and reduced RINs costs, offset in part by lower sales volumes.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.2 billion (25%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our petroleum business as a\nresult of higher sales prices for transportation fuels and byproducts. This increase was offset in part by our nitrogen fertilizer business primarily due to a decrease in sales prices for its products.\nCost of goods sold for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.2 billion (25%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of higher cost of consumed crude oil, due to higher prices, as well as increased products purchased for resale. This increase was offset in part by our nitrogen fertilizer business primarily due to higher costs in 2016 from inventory and deferred revenue fair value adjustments and decreased current year distribution costs due to the timing of regulatory railcar repairs and maintenance.\nGross margin for our Energy segment increased by $44 million (30%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 3% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for our petroleum business was higher due to higher margins per barrel resulting from an increase in the sales price of gasoline and distillates. Cost of consumed oil per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 21% as compared to the prior year. This increase was offset by a decrease attributable to our nitrogen fertilizer business.\nAutomotive\nOur Automotive segment's results of operations are generally driven by the distribution and installation of automotive aftermarket parts and are affected by the relative strength of automotive part replacement trends, among other factors. Our automotive aftermarket parts business is in a highly competitive industry and is smaller than several of its competitors, who have greater financial resources and operational capabilities. Acquisitions in recent years within our Automotive segment, including our acquisitions of The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack (\"Pep Boys\") in 2016 and the franchise businesses of Precision Tune Auto Care (\"Precision Tune\") and American Driveline Systems, the franchisor of AAMCO and licensor of Cottman Transmission service centers (\"American Driveline\"), in 2017, provided operating synergies, expanded our market presence, strengthened our parts distribution channel and enhanced our Automotive segment's ability to better service its customers. Our Automotive segment's results of operations also include automotive services labor. Automotive services labor revenues are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated statements of operations, however, the sale of any installed parts or materials related to automotive services are included in net sales. Therefore, we discuss the combined results of our automotive net sales and automotive services labor revenues below.\nOur Automotive segment is in the process of implementing a multi-year transformation plan, which includes the integration and restructuring of the operations of Pep Boys, IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC (\"IEH Auto\") and the franchise businesses of Precision Tune and American Driveline. Our Automotive segment's priorities include:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Positioning the service business to take advantage of opportunities in the do-it-for-me market and vehicle fleets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Optimizing the value of the commercial parts distribution business in high volume markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Improving inventory management across Icahn Automotive's parts and tire distribution network;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Optimizing the store and warehouse footprint through openings, closings, consolidations and conversions by market;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Digital initiatives including a new e-commerce platform and enhanced e-fulfillment capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment in customer experience initiatives such as enhanced customer loyalty programs and selective upgrades in facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment in employees with focus on training and career development investments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Business process improvements, including investments in our supply chain and information technology capabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The following table presents our Automotive segment's operating revenue, cost of revenue and gross margin:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales and other revenue from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold and other expenses from operations\n</td> <td>1,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>641\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales and other revenue from operations for our Automotive segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $135 million (5%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was attributable to an increase in automotive services revenues. On an organic basis, automotive services revenue increased by $52 million (5%) due to growing do-it-for-me and fleet businesses. Acquisitions accounted for an additional increase in automotive services revenue of $94 million (including $27 million from franchise royalty revenues), offset in part by a decrease of $11 million due to store closures. Aftermarket parts sales, including commercial and retail sales, remained flat over the comparable period as retail sales decreased by $24 million (4%) offset in part by an increase in commercial sales. Commercial sales increased by $67 million (7%) on an organic basis, driven by increases in IEH Auto sales as well as growth in Pep Boys commercial programs, as well as an additional $22 million from acquisitions, offset in part by $65 million due to the effects of the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606.\nCost of goods sold and other expenses from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $2 million (0%) compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of goods sold and automotive services labor increased by $62 million which was more than offset by the effects of the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606 as discussed above. Gross margin on net sales and automotive services labor revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $137 million (18%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and automotive services labor revenues was 31% and 27% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The improvement in gross margin primarily reflects higher margin percentages from franchisor operations as well as higher margins from automotive services due to cost improvements and selective price increases.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales and other revenue from operations for our Automotive segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $222 million (9%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was attributable to an increase in automotive services revenues of $188 million and an increase in aftermarket parts sales of $34 million. These increases in automotive services and aftermarket parts sales were due in part to the inclusion of Pep-Boys for the full twelve months in 2017 compared to eleven months in 2016. Automotive services also increased $21 million due to the acquisitions of Precision Tune and American Driveline in 2017.\nCost of goods sold and other expenses from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $118 million (6%), as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was due to volume increases. Gross margin on net sales and automotive services labor revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $104 million (16%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and automotive services labor revenues was 27% and 26% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The improvement in gross margin primarily reflects higher margin percentages from franchisor operations, which were first acquired in 2017, as well as higher margins from automotive services due to cost improvements and selective price increases.\nFood Packaging\nOur Food packaging segment's results of operations are primarily driven by the production and sale of cellulosic, fibrous and plastic casings for the processed meat and poultry industry and derives a majority of its total net sales from customers located outside the United States.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $3 million (1%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange, offset in part due to lower volume and unfavorable price and product mix. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $19 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to higher raw material and labor costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 20% and 24% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales over the comparable periods was primarily due to increasing raw material labor costs and lower fixed cost absorption.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $63 million (19%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, primarily from acquisitions, offset in part by unfavorable price and product mix and foreign currency exchange. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $48 million (19%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was flat at 24% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nMetals\nThe scrap metals business is highly cyclical and is substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the United States and other global markets. Ferrous and non-ferrous scrap has been historically vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn or stagnation.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $57 million (14%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to higher ferrous shipment volumes and higher average selling prices for most grades of material, partially offset by lower non-ferrous auto residue pricing and lower non-ferrous volume. Ferrous selling prices increased due to higher market pricing as domestic mill production benefited from trade cases and the effects of additional tariffs on steel imports. Improved consumer market pricing was also driven primarily by the increased demand from domestic steel mills.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $52 million (13%) compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher ferrous shipment volumes, as discussed above, and to increased material costs due to higher market prices. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was flat at 5% for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $142 million (53%) as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to higher ferrous, non-ferrous and non-ferrous auto residue shipment volumes and higher average selling prices. Ferrous shipment volumes increased due to improved demand from domestic steel mills and improved flow of raw materials into the recycling yards driven by increased market pricing. Additionally, during 2017, a major new steel mill came on line which increased demand for scrap metal. Domestic mill production has benefited from trade cases and speculation regarding the recent probe into steel imports. Improved consumer market pricing was also driven primarily by the increased demand from domestic steel mills. Non-ferrous shipment volumes increased 46% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to utilization of the capital investment in aluminum processing capabilities at one of our facilities made in late 2016, while higher pricing reflected higher terminal market prices in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $105 million (37%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher shipment volumes, as discussed above, and to increased material costs due to higher market prices. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of 6% in the comparable prior year period. The margin percentage improvement was driven by an increased material margin attributed to a continued focus on disciplined buying, higher pricing for non-ferrous auto residue, and by continued efforts to bring processing costs in line with volume and market pricing.\nReal Estate\nReal Estate revenues and expenses primarily include sales of residential units, results from club operations, rental income and expenses, including income from financing leases, and hotel, timeshare and casino operations. Sales of residential units are included in net sales in our consolidated financial statements. Results from club and rental operations, including financing lease income, and hotel, timeshare and casino operations are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated financial statements. Revenue from our real estate operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were substantially derived from income from club and rental operations.\nHome Fashion\nOur Home Fashion segment is significantly influenced by the overall economic environment, including consumer spending, at the retail level, for home textile products.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $12 million (7%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $18 million (11%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to sales mix and lower sales volume. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 16% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 11% for the comparable prior year period, with the increase primarily due to sale mix.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $12 million (6%) as compared to the comparable prior year period due to lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $6 million (4%) as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to sales mix. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 11% for\nthe year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 14% for the comparable prior year period, with the decrease primarily due to sales mix and inventory obsolescence.\nMining\nOur Mining segment's performance is driven by global iron ore prices and demand for raw materials from Chinese steelmakers. Since acquiring Ferrous Resources Ltd in 2015, our Mining segment has been concentrating on sales in its domestic market, Brazil.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $9 million as compared to the comparable prior year period due to volume increases. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $13 million (22%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to a certain plant operation resuming in 2018, increasing the cost of production to produce a higher quality of iron ore.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $23 million as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to iron ore price increases, offset in part by volume decreases. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $4 million as compared to the comparable prior year period.\nRailcar\nOur Railcar segment's other revenues from operations primarily relates to its railcar leasing revenue. On June 1, 2017 we sold American Railcar Leasing, LLC (\"ARL\") along with a majority of its railcar lease fleet. We sold the remaining railcars previously owned by ARL throughout the remainder of 2017 and the first nine months of 2018.\nHolding Company\nOur Holding Company's results of operations primarily reflect the interest expense on its senior unsecured notes for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We discuss interest expense in consolidation below. In addition, our Holding Company has investment gains and losses from debt and equity investments. During 2018, net loss from investment activities was primarily attributable to an unrealized loss from an equity investment offset in part by unrealized gains from an equity and debt investment. During 2017, unrealized gains from an equity investment was offset in part by unrealized losses from a debt investment. During 2016, net gain from investment activities was primarily due to realized gains from a debt investment.\nOther Consolidated Results of Operations\nGain On Disposition of Assets, Net\nAs discussed in Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements, our Real Estate segment sold two commercial rental properties, resulting in aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of $89 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, our Railcar segment sold its remaining railcars previously owned by ARL, resulting in aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring 2017, we sold ARL along with a majority of its railcar lease fleet, resulting in an aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of approximately $1.7 billion recorded by our Railcar segment for the year ended December 31, 2017. In August 2017, our Real Estate segment sold a development property in Las Vegas Nevada, resulting in a pretax gain on disposition of assets of $456 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Real Estate segment also sold additional properties during 2017, primarily within its rental operations, resulting in an additional pretax gain on disposition of assets aggregating $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOur consolidated selling, general and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $117 million (9%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase from our Automotive segment of $132 million primarily due to the inclusion of various acquisitions of automotive businesses as well as costs associated with the growth of the commercial parts business. This increase was offset in part primarily due to our Railcar segment, which decreased due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017, as well as aggregate net decreases within various other segments.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur consolidated selling, general and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $268 million (27%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase from our Automotive segment of $271 million primarily due to the inclusion of the full year impact of Pep Boys in 2017, which was acquired in February 2016, and the acquisitions of Precision Tune, American Driveline and various other acquisitions in 2017, as well as personnel costs associated with integration and increased customer services. There were aggregate net increases within various other segments which were more than offset by a decrease of $21 million from our Investment segment due to a decrease of compensation expense.\nRestructuring\nOur consolidated restructuring, net for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $21 million, $4 million and $5 million, respectively, and was primarily attributable to our Food Packaging segment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Food Packaging segment recorded $9 million of restructuring charges for employee costs relating to certain of its European operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Energy segment recorded $5 million of restructuring charges for employee costs and other exit costs relating to an office closure. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Automotive segment recorded $5 million of restructuring charges primarily for exit costs relating to facility closures. Refer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" to the consolidated financial statements for net restructuring charges recorded by each of our segments.\nImpairment\nRefer to Note 5, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of assets.\nInterest Expense\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOur consolidated interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $131 million (20%) as compared the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to a decrease in due to broker balances over the respective periods, as well as lower interest expense from our Railcar segment due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by higher interest expense from our Holding Company due to debt refinancing in December 2017, resulting in debt with higher interest rates.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $37 million (5%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to a decrease in due to broker balances over the respective periods, as well as lower interest expense from our Railcar segment due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by higher interest expense from our Energy segment due to a certain debt offering in the second quarter of 2016, as well as higher interest expense from our Holding Company due to our senior unsecured notes refinancing in the first quarter of 2017, which is subject to higher interest rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nCertain of our subsidiaries are partnerships not subject to taxation in our consolidated financial statements and certain other subsidiaries are corporations, or subsidiaries of corporations, subject to taxation in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, our consolidated effective tax rate generally differs from the statutory federal tax rate. Refer to Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes.\nIn addition, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, we analyze all positive and negative evidence and maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are not considered more likely than not to be realized. Based on current analysis, including increased level of income and ability to use losses previously limited, we have determined that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. tax loss carryforwards and credits will be realized and have released the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs discussed in Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements, we operated discontinued operations previously included in our Automotive and Railcar segments and former Gaming segment. The sales of each of the businesses closed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and resulted in aggregate pre-tax gains on the sales of discontinued operations attributable to Icahn Enterprises of approximately $1.4 billion.\nSee Note 13, \"Discontinued Operations,\" to the consolidated financial statements, for financial information with respect to each of our discontinued operating businesses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHolding Company Liquidity\nWe are a holding company. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make distributions with respect to depositary units likely will depend on the cash flow resulting from divestitures, equity and debt financings, interest income, returns on our interests in the Investment Funds and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends and distributions. We may pursue various means to raise cash from our subsidiaries. To date, such means include receipt of dividends and distributions from subsidiaries, obtaining loans or other financings based on the asset values of subsidiaries or selling debt or equity securities of subsidiaries through capital market transactions. To the degree any distributions and transfers are impaired or prohibited, our ability to make payments on our debt or distributions on our depositary units could be limited. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. In addition, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.8 billion and total debt of approximately $5.5 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our Holding Company had investments in the Investment Funds with a total fair market value of approximately $5.1 billion. We may redeem our direct investment in the Investment Funds upon notice. See \"Investment Segment Liquidity\" below for additional information with respect to our Investment segment liquidity.\nSale of Businesses and Assets\nOn October 1, 2018, we closed on the sales of Federal-Mogul and Tropicana and on December 5, 2018, we closed on the sale of ARI. In addition, during 2018, we sold our remaining railcars previously owned by ARL. These dispositions resulted in aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion during 2018. As part of the proceeds from the sale of Federal-Mogul, we also acquired a non-controlling interest in the purchaser, Tenneco, Inc. (\"Tenneco\"), represented by an aggregate of approximately 29.5 million voting and non-voting shares of Tenneco common stock with a fair market value of approximately $1.2 billion at the time of sale. Refer to Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn addition, on December 5, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Ferrous Resources. The transaction is expected to close in 2019 and, if consummated, will provide additional liquidity to our Holding Company.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 29, 2019, we received $60 million in connection with CVR Energy's purchase of all remaining common units of CVR Refining, which included all common units of CVR Refining held directly by us.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, CVR Energy declared a quarterly dividend which should result in an additional $53 million in dividends payable to us in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, Tenneco declared a quarterly dividend which should result in an additional $7 million in dividends payable to us in the first quarter of 2019.\nHolding Company Borrowings and Availability\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.000% senior unsecured notes due 2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2022\n</td> <td>1,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.250% senior unsecured notes due 2022\n</td> <td>1,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2024\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025\n</td> <td>748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHolding Company debt consists of various issues of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued by Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Finance Corp. and guaranteed by Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Interest on each of the senior unsecured notes are payable semi-annually.\nThe indentures governing our senior unsecured notes described above restrict the payment of cash distributions, the purchase of equity interests or the purchase, redemption, defeasance or acquisition of debt subordinated to the senior unsecured notes. The indentures also restrict the incurrence of debt or the issuance of disqualified stock, as defined in the indentures, with certain exceptions. In addition, the indentures require that on each quarterly determination date, we and the guarantor of the notes (currently only Icahn Enterprises Holdings) maintain certain minimum financial ratios, as defined therein. The indentures also restrict the creation of liens, mergers, consolidations and sales of substantially all of our assets, and transactions with affiliates. Additionally, each of the senior unsecured notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018 are subject to optional redemption premiums in the event we redeem any of the notes prior to certain dates as described in the indentures.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants, including maintaining certain minimum financial ratios, as defined in the indentures. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, based on covenants in the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, we are permitted to incur approximately $2.0 billion of additional indebtedness.\nDistributions on Depositary Units\nOn February 26, 2019, the Board of Directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $2.00 per depositary unit. The quarterly distribution is payable in either cash or additional depositary units, at the election of each depositary unitholder and will be paid on or about April 17, 2019 to depositary unitholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared four quarterly distributions aggregating $7.00 per depositary unit. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates elected to receive their proportionate share of these distributions in depositary units. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 91.7% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2018. In connection with these distributions, aggregate cash distributions to all depositary unitholders was $95 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe declaration and payment of distributions is reviewed quarterly by Icahn Enterprises GP's board of directors based upon a review of our balance sheet and cash flow, our expected capital and liquidity requirements, the provisions of our partnership agreement and provisions in our financing arrangements governing distributions, and keeping in mind that limited partners subject to U.S. federal income tax have recognized income on our earnings even if they do not receive distributions that could be used to satisfy any resulting tax obligations. The payment of future distributions will be determined by the board of directors quarterly, based upon the factors described above and other factors that it deems relevant at the time that declaration of a distribution is considered. Payments of distributions are subject to certain restrictions, including certain restrictions on our subsidiaries which limit their ability to distribute dividends to us. There can be no assurance as to whether or in what amounts any future distributions might be paid.\nInvestment Segment Liquidity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we invested approximately $1.7 billion in the Investment Funds, net of redemptions, and affiliates of Mr. Icahn (excluding us and our subsidiaries) invested $310 million in the Investment Funds. In addition to investments by us and other affiliates of Mr. Icahn, the Investment Funds historically have access to significant amounts of cash available from prime brokerage lines of credit, subject to customary terms and market conditions.\nAdditionally, our Investment segment liquidity is driven by the investment activities and performance of the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2018, the Investment Funds' had a net short notional exposure of 24%. The Investment Funds' long exposure was 69% (67% long equity and 2% long credit and other) and its short exposure was 93% (88% short equity and 5% short credit and other). The notional exposure represents the ratio of the notional exposure of the Investment Funds' invested capital to the net asset value of the Investment Funds at December 31, 2018.\nOf the Investment Funds' 69% long exposure, 68% was comprised of the fair value of its long positions (with certain adjustments) and 1% was comprised of single name equity forward contracts and credit contracts. Of the Investment Funds' 93% short exposure, 4% was comprised of the fair value of our short positions and 89% was comprised of short credit default swap contracts and short broad market index swap derivative contracts.\nWith respect to both our long positions that are not notionalized (68% long exposure) and our short positions that are not notionalized (4% short), each 1% change in exposure as a result of purchases or sales (assuming no change in value) would have a 1% impact on our cash and cash equivalents (as a percentage of net asset value). Changes in exposure as a result of purchases and sales as well as adverse changes in market value would also have an effect on funds available to us pursuant to prime brokerage lines of credit.\nWith respect to the notional value of our other short positions (89% short exposure), our liquidity would decrease by the balance sheet unrealized loss if we were to close the positions at year end prices. This would be offset by a release of restricted cash balances collateralizing these positions as well as an increase in funds available to us pursuant to certain prime brokerage lines of credit. If we were to increase our short exposure by adding to these short positions, we would be required to provide cash collateral equal to a small percentage of the initial notional value at counterparties that require cash as collateral and then post additional collateral equal to 100% of the mark to market on adverse changes in fair value. For our counterparties who do not require cash collateral, funds available from lines of credit would decrease.\nOther Segment Liquidity\nSegment Cash and Cash Equivalents\nSegment cash and cash equivalents (excluding our Investment segment) consists of the following:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food Packaging\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metals\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Fashion\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Mining segment had $11 million of cash and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nSegment Borrowings and Availability\nSegment debt consists of the following:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food Packaging\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metals\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Fashion\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Mining segment had $55 million of debt included in liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nOur segments have additional borrowing availability under certain revolving credit facilities as summarized below:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food Packaging\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metals\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Fashion\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above outstanding debt and borrowing availability with respect to each of our continuing operating segments reflects third-party obligations.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities for 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to our Energy segment resulting from changes in the biofuel blending obligation caused by changes in RINs prices.\nCapital expenditures are primarily from our Energy, Automotive and Mining segments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Energy segment's capital expenditures were $102 million, primarily for maintenance, our Automotive segment's capital expenditures were $66 million, primarily for store improvements, and our Mining segment's capital expenditures were $40 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Energy segment's capital expenditures were $120 million\nand $133 million, respectively, our Automotive segment's capital expenditures were $86 million and $37 million, respectively, and our Mining segment's capital expenditures were $38 million and $22 million, respectively.\nAcquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, primarily relates to our Automotive segment. Our Automotive segment's acquisitions included various service businesses aggregating $15 million in 2018, the acquisitions of Precision Tune, American Driveline and various other service businesses aggregating $218 million in 2017 and its acquisitions of Pep Boys and certain other businesses aggregating $971 million in 2016. In addition, our Food Packaging segment acquired a casings manufacturer for $31 million in 2017 and had other acquisitions of $4 million in 2016, and our Energy segment acquired a nitrogen fertilizer business for common units of CVR Partners and $64 million of net cash consideration in 2016. Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired in 2016 were offset by $30 million of cash held by casino properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey which we obtained a controlling equity interest in through the conversion of our prior debt investment in such casino business.\nProceeds from sale of assets are primarily due to our Real Estate segment's dispositions of certain properties in 2018 and 2017. Proceeds from sale of assets for 2016 primarily relates to our Automotive segment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our Railcar segment received $120 million from our Holding Company for the repayment of an intercompany loan and during the year ended December 31, 2016, our Railcar segment paid $125 million to our Holding Company for the issuance of the intercompany loan.\nDistributions to non-controlling interests were from our Energy segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, relating to its regular quarterly dividends and distributions, excluding payments made to us.\nNet distributions to and contributions from our Holding Company include the dividends and distributions paid by our Energy segment of $192 million, $148 million and $142 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as well as by our Real Estate segment of $543 million, $374 million and $4 million, respectively, and by our Railcar segment of $0 million, $47 million and $75 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our Automotive segment also distributed $100 million to our Holding Company. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Automotive segment received funds in the form of investments from our Holding Company of $365 million, $504 million and $1,042 million, respectively, for the acquisition of businesses, investments in 767 Auto Leasing LLC and costs associated with our Automotive segment's multi-year transformation plan. Our other operating segments received funds in the form of loans and investments from our Holding Company aggregating $34 million, $28 million and $81 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Food Packaging segment also received $50 million in 2018 in connection with a rights offering, including $44 million from our Holding Company.\nDiscontinued Operations\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal-Mogul\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tropicana\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARI\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transactions with Holding Company\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal-Mogul\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tropicana\n</td> <td>(55\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARI\n</td> <td>(119\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(580\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal-Mogul\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tropicana\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARI\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contributions from (distributions to) Holding Company\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(251\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations was primarily due to net cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI. However, Federal-Mogul's cash flows from operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was also significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to a buildup of inventory in 2017 compared to a reduction of inventory in 2016.\nOur cash flows from investing activities from discontinued operations were primarily due to capital expenditures for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI.\nOur cash flows from financing activities from discontinued operations were primarily due to net debt transactions for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI. In addition, ARI had aggregate quarterly dividends of $23 million, $31 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $14 million, $19 million and $19 million were paid to us. In 2018, Federal-Mogul also received $56 million from us in connection with a certain litigation reserve.\nConsolidated Capital Expenditures\nRefer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" for a reconciliation of our segments' capital expenditures to consolidated capital expenditures for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nWe estimate that our consolidated capital expenditures for our continuing operating businesses to be approximately $239 million for our Energy segment, a majority of which is planned for maintenance, $60 million for our Automotive segment, primarily for strategic priorities and growth, and approximately $63 million in the aggregate for all other segments.\nConsolidated Contractual Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table reflects, at December 31, 2018, our contractual cash obligations, subject to certain conditions, due over the indicated periods:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and other post-retirement benefit plans\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above excludes debt obligations of $55 million and related interest payments of $14 million relating to our Mining segment, which is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nCertain of CVR Energy's and PSC Metals' facilities are environmentally impaired. As of December 31, 2018, CVR Energy and PSC Metals have recorded environmental liabilities of $8 million and $27 million, respectively. For further discussion regarding these commitments, among others, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs discussed in Note 4, Investments and Related Matters,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, we have contractual liabilities of $468 million related to securities sold, not yet purchased as of December 31, 2018. This amount has not been included in the table above as maturity is not subject to a contract and cannot be properly estimated.\nConsolidated Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have off-balance sheet risk related to investment activities associated with certain financial instruments, including futures, options, credit default swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased. For additional information regarding these arrangements, refer to Note 6, Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Among others, estimates are used when accounting for valuation of investments. Estimates used in determining fair value measurements include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flow assumptions, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans, settlement plans for litigation and contingencies, and appropriate discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nExcept as described below, no provision has been made for federal, state, local or foreign income taxes on the results of operations generated by partnership activities as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners. Our corporate subsidiaries account for their income taxes under the asset and liability method.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nOn December 22, 2017, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Legislation\") was enacted in the United States, significantly revising certain U.S. corporate income tax provisions; including, among other items, a reduction of the U.S. corporate rate from 35% to 21%, effective for tax year beginning after December 31, 2017; the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system; and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, (or, if greater, November 2, 2017) of a specified foreign corporation\u201d which includes controlled foreign corporations and other foreign corporations which have at least one U.S. corporate shareholder that owns 10% or more of the value or voting power of such foreign corporation. We estimated the impact of the Tax Legislation on our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Legislation and guidance available at the date of this filing and as a result have recorded adjustments to the various tax balances, current, long-term and deferred tax assets and liabilities, all during the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the Tax Legislation was enacted. The actual amounts recorded in 2017 were not significantly different from the provisional amounts estimated in the prior year tax provision.\nManagement periodically evaluates all evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets is still needed. For each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, we concluded, based on the projections of taxable income, that certain of our corporate subsidiaries more likely than not will realize a partial benefit from their deferred tax assets and loss carry forwards. Ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon, among other factors, our corporate subsidiaries' ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods and is subject to change depending on the tax laws in effect in the years in which the carryforwards are used.\nSee Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our income taxes.\nValuation of Investments\nThe fair value of our investments, including securities sold, not yet purchased, is based on observable market prices when available. Securities owned by the Investment Funds that are listed on a securities exchange are valued at their last sales price on the primary securities exchange on which such securities are traded on such date. Securities that are not listed on any exchange but are traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the last bid\u201d and ask\u201d price for such security on such date. Securities and other instruments for which market quotes are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the applicable general partner. For some investments little market activity may exist; management's\ndetermination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment.\nLong-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWe calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various definite-lived assets. When assets are placed in service, we make estimates of what we believe are their reasonable useful lives.\nLong-lived assets held and used by our various operating segments and long-lived assets to be disposed of are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as vacancies and rejected leases and reduced production capacity, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Definite-lived assets held by our various segments are periodically reviewed for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required analysis and an impairment loss is recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, held by our various segments are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment is necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss, equal to the difference (limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the tested reporting unit), is recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated goodwill was $247 million, primarily within our Automotive segment. We perform the annual goodwill impairment test for our Automotive segment as of October 1 of each year. Based on our annual goodwill impairment analysis for our Automotive segment, we determined that the carrying value of its Parts reporting unit exceeded its fair value and as a result, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to the Parts reporting unit. We also determined that the fair value of our Automotive segment's Service reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value and therefore, no impairment is required. As of December 31, 2018, our Automotive segment had remaining goodwill of $241 million, which is allocated entirely to its Service reporting unit.\nWe base the fair value of our reporting units on consideration of various valuation methodologies, including projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved (\"DCF\"). Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective. The inputs used to determine the fair values of our reporting units, including future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates and other assumptions involves a significant degree of judgment.\nSee Note 5, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the fair value measurements of our long-live assets as well as goodwill and intangible assets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to us.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our present business and the results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Report.\nExecutive Overview\nIntroduction\nIcahn Enterprises L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises\u201d) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises Holdings\u201d) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. References to \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nIcahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Icahn Enterprises and conduct substantially all of its operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to allocations to the general and limited partners. We do not discuss Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings separately unless we believe it is necessary to an understanding of the businesses.\nWe are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses: Investment, Energy, Automotive, Food Packaging, Metals, Real Estate, Home Fashion and Mining. We also report the results of our Holding Company, which includes the results of certain subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings (unless otherwise noted), and investment activity and expenses associated with our Holding Company. Our historical results also report the results of our Railcar segment through the date we sold our last remaining railcars on lease, which occurred in the third quarter of 2018.\nSignificant Transactions and Developments\nSignificant transactions and developments affecting our results of operations and liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2018 are summarized as follows:\nSale of Discontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we closed on the sales of Federal-Mogul LLC (\"Federal-Mogul\"), Tropicana Entertainment Inc. (\"Tropicana\") and American Railcar Industries, Inc. (\"ARI\"). As a result of the transactions, our Holding Company received approximately $3.2 billion in aggregate cash proceeds and approximately $1.2 billion of fair value equity in Tenneco, Inc., resulting in the recognition of aggregate pre-tax gains on the sales of discontinued operations attributable to Icahn Enterprises of approximately $1.4 billion.\nPending Sale of Ferrous Resources. On December 5, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Ferrous Resources Ltd. for total consideration of $550 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Financial Results\nOur operating businesses comprise consolidated subsidiaries which operate in various industries and are managed on a decentralized basis. Revenues for our continuing operating businesses primarily consist of net sales of various products, services revenue, franchisor operations and leasing of real estate. Due to the structure and nature of our business, we primarily discuss the results of operations by individual reporting segment in order to better understand our consolidated operating performance. Certain other financial information is discussed on a consolidated basis following our segment discussion, including other revenues and expenses included in continuing operations as well as our results from discontinued operations. In addition to the summarized financial results below, refer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of each of our reporting segment's results of continuing operations to our consolidated results.\nThe comparability of our summarized consolidated financial results presented below is affected by, among other factors, (i) the performance of the Investment Funds, (ii) the results of our Energy segment's operations, impacted by the relationship of its refined product prices and prices for crude oil and other feedstocks, (iii) impairment charges, primarily in our Automotive segment in 2018 and our Energy segment in 2016, (iv) acquisitions of businesses, primarily in our Automotive segment during 2017 and 2016, (v) gains on dispositions of assets, primarily in our Railcar and Real Estate segments in 2017, including the impact of the disposed income generating assets on subsequent operations, (vi) our Holding Company's unrealized equity investment gains and losses and (vii) the enactment of tax legislation in the United States in 2017. Refer to our respective segment discussions and \"Other Consolidated Results of Operations,\" below for further discussion.

various private investment funds (the \"Investment Funds\"). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $5.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total fair market value of investments in the Investment Funds made by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (excluding us) was approximately $5.0 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.\nOur Investment segment's results of operations are reflected in net income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Investment segment's net income (loss) is driven by the amount of funds allocated to the Investment Funds and the performance of the underlying investments in the Investment Funds. Future funds allocated to the Investment Funds may increase or decrease based on the contributions and redemptions by our Holding Company and by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates. Additionally, historical performance results of the Investment Funds are not indicative of future results as past market\nconditions, investment opportunities and investment decisions may not occur in the future. Changes in general market conditions coupled with changes in exposure to short and long positions have significant impact on our Investment segment's results of operations and the comparability of results of operations year over year and as such, future results of operations will be impacted by our future exposures and future market conditions, which may not be consistent with prior trends. Refer to the \"Investment Segment Liquidity\" section of our \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" discussion for additional information regarding our Investment segment's exposure as of December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Investment Funds' returns were 7.9%, 2.1% and (20.3)%, respectively. Our Investment Funds' returns represent a weighted-average composite of the average returns, net of expenses.

The positive performance of our Investment segment's short positions was driven by the positive performance of broad market hedges of $642 million and the aggregate performance of multiple other short positions with net gains across various sectors, primarily the energy sector. The negative performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by losses from two consumer, cyclical sector investments, a basic material sector investment, two consumer, non-cyclical sector investments, a technology sector investment and an industrial sector investment with losses aggregating approximately $1.4 billion. The aggregate performance of investments with net losses across various other sectors accounted for an additional negative performance of our Investment segment's long positions. Losses in long positions were offset in part by gains from a consumer, non-cyclical sector investment, a technology sector investment and an energy sector investment with gains aggregating approximately $1.3 billion.\nFor 2017, the Investment Funds' positive performance was driven by net gains in their long positions, offset in part by net losses in their short positions. The positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by gains from two consumer, non-cyclical sector investments, a basic materials sector investment, an energy sector investment and a consumer, cyclical sector investment aggregating approximately $1.6 billion. The aggregate performance of investments with gains across various other sectors accounted for the additional positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions, offset in part by the aggregate performance of investments with losses in the financial sector. Losses in short positions were attributable to the negative performance of broad market hedges of approximately $2.1 billion and the negative performance of various other short positions across multiple sectors. Losses in short positions were offset in part by the positive performance of three consumer, cyclical sector short positions aggregating $627 million.\nFor 2016, the Investment Funds' negative performance was driven by net losses in their short positions, offset in part by net gains in their long positions. Losses in short positions were attributable to the negative performance of broad market hedges of approximately $1.5 billion, as well as the negative performance of other short positions, primarily in the consumer, cyclical sector. The positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by gains from a certain basic materials sector investment of $561 million. The aggregate performance of investments with gains across various other sectors were offset by the aggregate performance of investments with losses primarily in the technology and consumer non-cyclical sectors.\nEnergy\nOur Energy segment is primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing businesses. The sale of petroleum products accounted for approximately 95%, 94% and 93% of our Energy segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe results of operations of the petroleum business are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks that are processed and blended into petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel, that are produced by a refinery (\"refined products\"). The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond our Energy segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as gasoline and other refined products. This supply and demand depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum business applies first-in, first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact gross margin in the short-term fluctuations in the market price of inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the petroleum business' results of operations is influenced by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which requires it to either blend renewable fuels\u201d in with its transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and the future cost of RINs for the petroleum business is difficult to estimate. Additionally, the cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of the petroleum business' petroleum products, as well as the fuel blending performed at its refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Refer to Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of RINs.\nThe following table presents our Energy segment's net sales, cost of goods sold and gross margin:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>6,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.1 billion (19%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of an increase in refined products crack spreads, partially offset by decreased sales volumes. Our nitrogen fertilizer business' net sales increased over the comparable periods due to higher sales prices and volumes.\nCost of goods sold for our Energy segment increased by $654 million (11%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of a higher cost of consumed crude oil offset in part by a decrease in RINs costs. The increase in consumed crude oil costs was due to an increase in crude oil prices, offset in part by a decrease in consumed crude volume. The net cost of RINs was favorably impacted by a reduction in the petroleum segment's RFS obligation and reduced market pricing.\nGross margin for our Energy segment increased by $482 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 9% and 3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with an increase attributable to our petroleum business. The increase in the gross margin as a percentage of net sales for our petroleum business was primarily due to higher gross margins per barrel resulting from a higher refined product crack spreads and reduced RINs costs, offset in part by lower sales volumes.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.2 billion (25%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our petroleum business as a\nresult of higher sales prices for transportation fuels and byproducts. This increase was offset in part by our nitrogen fertilizer business primarily due to a decrease in sales prices for its products.\nCost of goods sold for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.2 billion (25%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of higher cost of consumed crude oil, due to higher prices, as well as increased products purchased for resale. This increase was offset in part by our nitrogen fertilizer business primarily due to higher costs in 2016 from inventory and deferred revenue fair value adjustments and decreased current year distribution costs due to the timing of regulatory railcar repairs and maintenance.\nGross margin for our Energy segment increased by $44 million (30%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 3% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for our petroleum business was higher due to higher margins per barrel resulting from an increase in the sales price of gasoline and distillates. Cost of consumed oil per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 21% as compared to the prior year. This increase was offset by a decrease attributable to our nitrogen fertilizer business.\nAutomotive\nOur Automotive segment's results of operations are generally driven by the distribution and installation of automotive aftermarket parts and are affected by the relative strength of automotive part replacement trends, among other factors. Our automotive aftermarket parts business is in a highly competitive industry and is smaller than several of its competitors, who have greater financial resources and operational capabilities. Acquisitions in recent years within our Automotive segment, including our acquisitions of The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack (\"Pep Boys\") in 2016 and the franchise businesses of Precision Tune Auto Care (\"Precision Tune\") and American Driveline Systems, the franchisor of AAMCO and licensor of Cottman Transmission service centers (\"American Driveline\"), in 2017, provided operating synergies, expanded our market presence, strengthened our parts distribution channel and enhanced our Automotive segment's ability to better service its customers. Our Automotive segment's results of operations also include automotive services labor. Automotive services labor revenues are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated statements of operations, however, the sale of any installed parts or materials related to automotive services are included in net sales. Therefore, we discuss the combined results of our automotive net sales and automotive services labor revenues below.\nOur Automotive segment is in the process of implementing a multi-year transformation plan, which includes the integration and restructuring of the operations of Pep Boys, IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC (\"IEH Auto\") and the franchise businesses of Precision Tune and American Driveline. Our Automotive segment's priorities include:\n \u2022 Positioning the service business to take advantage of opportunities in the do-it-for-me market and vehicle fleets; \n \u2022 Optimizing the value of the commercial parts distribution business in high volume markets; \n \u2022 Improving inventory management across Icahn Automotive's parts and tire distribution network; \n \u2022 Optimizing the store and warehouse footprint through openings, closings, consolidations and conversions by market; \n \u2022 Digital initiatives including a new e-commerce platform and enhanced e-fulfillment capabilities; \n \u2022 Investment in customer experience initiatives such as enhanced customer loyalty programs and selective upgrades in facilities; \n \u2022 Investment in employees with focus on training and career development investments; and \n \u2022 Business process improvements, including investments in our supply chain and information technology capabilities.  The following table presents our Automotive segment's operating revenue, cost of revenue and gross margin:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales and other revenue from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold and other expenses from operations\n</td> <td>1,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>641\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales and other revenue from operations for our Automotive segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $135 million (5%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was attributable to an increase in automotive services revenues. On an organic basis, automotive services revenue increased by $52 million (5%) due to growing do-it-for-me and fleet businesses. Acquisitions accounted for an additional increase in automotive services revenue of $94 million (including $27 million from franchise royalty revenues), offset in part by a decrease of $11 million due to store closures. Aftermarket parts sales, including commercial and retail sales, remained flat over the comparable period as retail sales decreased by $24 million (4%) offset in part by an increase in commercial sales. Commercial sales increased by $67 million (7%) on an organic basis, driven by increases in IEH Auto sales as well as growth in Pep Boys commercial programs, as well as an additional $22 million from acquisitions, offset in part by $65 million due to the effects of the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606.\nCost of goods sold and other expenses from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $2 million (0%) compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of goods sold and automotive services labor increased by $62 million which was more than offset by the effects of the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606 as discussed above. Gross margin on net sales and automotive services labor revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $137 million (18%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and automotive services labor revenues was 31% and 27% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The improvement in gross margin primarily reflects higher margin percentages from franchisor operations as well as higher margins from automotive services due to cost improvements and selective price increases.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales and other revenue from operations for our Automotive segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $222 million (9%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was attributable to an increase in automotive services revenues of $188 million and an increase in aftermarket parts sales of $34 million. These increases in automotive services and aftermarket parts sales were due in part to the inclusion of Pep-Boys for the full twelve months in 2017 compared to eleven months in 2016. Automotive services also increased $21 million due to the acquisitions of Precision Tune and American Driveline in 2017.\nCost of goods sold and other expenses from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $118 million (6%), as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was due to volume increases. Gross margin on net sales and automotive services labor revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $104 million (16%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and automotive services labor revenues was 27% and 26% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The improvement in gross margin primarily reflects higher margin percentages from franchisor operations, which were first acquired in 2017, as well as higher margins from automotive services due to cost improvements and selective price increases.\nFood Packaging\nOur Food packaging segment's results of operations are primarily driven by the production and sale of cellulosic, fibrous and plastic casings for the processed meat and poultry industry and derives a majority of its total net sales from customers located outside the United States.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $3 million (1%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange, offset in part due to lower volume and unfavorable price and product mix. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $19 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to higher raw material and labor costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 20% and 24% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales over the comparable periods was primarily due to increasing raw material labor costs and lower fixed cost absorption.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $63 million (19%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, primarily from acquisitions, offset in part by unfavorable price and product mix and foreign currency exchange. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $48 million (19%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was flat at 24% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nMetals\nThe scrap metals business is highly cyclical and is substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the United States and other global markets. Ferrous and non-ferrous scrap has been historically vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn or stagnation.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $57 million (14%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to higher ferrous shipment volumes and higher average selling prices for most grades of material, partially offset by lower non-ferrous auto residue pricing and lower non-ferrous volume. Ferrous selling prices increased due to higher market pricing as domestic mill production benefited from trade cases and the effects of additional tariffs on steel imports. Improved consumer market pricing was also driven primarily by the increased demand from domestic steel mills.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $52 million (13%) compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher ferrous shipment volumes, as discussed above, and to increased material costs due to higher market prices. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was flat at 5% for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $142 million (53%) as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to higher ferrous, non-ferrous and non-ferrous auto residue shipment volumes and higher average selling prices. Ferrous shipment volumes increased due to improved demand from domestic steel mills and improved flow of raw materials into the recycling yards driven by increased market pricing. Additionally, during 2017, a major new steel mill came on line which increased demand for scrap metal. Domestic mill production has benefited from trade cases and speculation regarding the recent probe into steel imports. Improved consumer market pricing was also driven primarily by the increased demand from domestic steel mills. Non-ferrous shipment volumes increased 46% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to utilization of the capital investment in aluminum processing capabilities at one of our facilities made in late 2016, while higher pricing reflected higher terminal market prices in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $105 million (37%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher shipment volumes, as discussed above, and to increased material costs due to higher market prices. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of 6% in the comparable prior year period. The margin percentage improvement was driven by an increased material margin attributed to a continued focus on disciplined buying, higher pricing for non-ferrous auto residue, and by continued efforts to bring processing costs in line with volume and market pricing.\nReal Estate\nReal Estate revenues and expenses primarily include sales of residential units, results from club operations, rental income and expenses, including income from financing leases, and hotel, timeshare and casino operations. Sales of residential units are included in net sales in our consolidated financial statements. Results from club and rental operations, including financing lease income, and hotel, timeshare and casino operations are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated financial statements. Revenue from our real estate operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were substantially derived from income from club and rental operations.\nHome Fashion\nOur Home Fashion segment is significantly influenced by the overall economic environment, including consumer spending, at the retail level, for home textile products.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $12 million (7%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $18 million (11%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to sales mix and lower sales volume. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 16% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 11% for the comparable prior year period, with the increase primarily due to sale mix.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $12 million (6%) as compared to the comparable prior year period due to lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $6 million (4%) as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to sales mix. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 11% for\nthe year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 14% for the comparable prior year period, with the decrease primarily due to sales mix and inventory obsolescence.\nMining\nOur Mining segment's performance is driven by global iron ore prices and demand for raw materials from Chinese steelmakers. Since acquiring Ferrous Resources Ltd in 2015, our Mining segment has been concentrating on sales in its domestic market, Brazil.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $9 million as compared to the comparable prior year period due to volume increases. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $13 million (22%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to a certain plant operation resuming in 2018, increasing the cost of production to produce a higher quality of iron ore.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $23 million as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to iron ore price increases, offset in part by volume decreases. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $4 million as compared to the comparable prior year period.\nRailcar\nOur Railcar segment's other revenues from operations primarily relates to its railcar leasing revenue. On June 1, 2017 we sold American Railcar Leasing, LLC (\"ARL\") along with a majority of its railcar lease fleet. We sold the remaining railcars previously owned by ARL throughout the remainder of 2017 and the first nine months of 2018.\nHolding Company\nOur Holding Company's results of operations primarily reflect the interest expense on its senior unsecured notes for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We discuss interest expense in consolidation below. In addition, our Holding Company has investment gains and losses from debt and equity investments. During 2018, net loss from investment activities was primarily attributable to an unrealized loss from an equity investment offset in part by unrealized gains from an equity and debt investment. During 2017, unrealized gains from an equity investment was offset in part by unrealized losses from a debt investment. During 2016, net gain from investment activities was primarily due to realized gains from a debt investment.\nOther Consolidated Results of Operations\nGain On Disposition of Assets, Net\nAs discussed in Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements, our Real Estate segment sold two commercial rental properties, resulting in aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of $89 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, our Railcar segment sold its remaining railcars previously owned by ARL, resulting in aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring 2017, we sold ARL along with a majority of its railcar lease fleet, resulting in an aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of approximately $1.7 billion recorded by our Railcar segment for the year ended December 31, 2017. In August 2017, our Real Estate segment sold a development property in Las Vegas Nevada, resulting in a pretax gain on disposition of assets of $456 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Real Estate segment also sold additional properties during 2017, primarily within its rental operations, resulting in an additional pretax gain on disposition of assets aggregating $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOur consolidated selling, general and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $117 million (9%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase from our Automotive segment of $132 million primarily due to the inclusion of various acquisitions of automotive businesses as well as costs associated with the growth of the commercial parts business. This increase was offset in part primarily due to our Railcar segment, which decreased due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017, as well as aggregate net decreases within various other segments.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur consolidated selling, general and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $268 million (27%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase from our Automotive segment of $271 million primarily due to the inclusion of the full year impact of Pep Boys in 2017, which was acquired in February 2016, and the acquisitions of Precision Tune, American Driveline and various other acquisitions in 2017, as well as personnel costs associated with integration and increased customer services. There were aggregate net increases within various other segments which were more than offset by a decrease of $21 million from our Investment segment due to a decrease of compensation expense.\nRestructuring\nOur consolidated restructuring, net for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $21 million, $4 million and $5 million, respectively, and was primarily attributable to our Food Packaging segment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Food Packaging segment recorded $9 million of restructuring charges for employee costs relating to certain of its European operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Energy segment recorded $5 million of restructuring charges for employee costs and other exit costs relating to an office closure. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Automotive segment recorded $5 million of restructuring charges primarily for exit costs relating to facility closures. Refer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" to the consolidated financial statements for net restructuring charges recorded by each of our segments.\nImpairment\nRefer to Note 5, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of assets.\nInterest Expense\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOur consolidated interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $131 million (20%) as compared the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to a decrease in due to broker balances over the respective periods, as well as lower interest expense from our Railcar segment due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by higher interest expense from our Holding Company due to debt refinancing in December 2017, resulting in debt with higher interest rates.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $37 million (5%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to a decrease in due to broker balances over the respective periods, as well as lower interest expense from our Railcar segment due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by higher interest expense from our Energy segment due to a certain debt offering in the second quarter of 2016, as well as higher interest expense from our Holding Company due to our senior unsecured notes refinancing in the first quarter of 2017, which is subject to higher interest rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nCertain of our subsidiaries are partnerships not subject to taxation in our consolidated financial statements and certain other subsidiaries are corporations, or subsidiaries of corporations, subject to taxation in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, our consolidated effective tax rate generally differs from the statutory federal tax rate. Refer to Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes.\nIn addition, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, we analyze all positive and negative evidence and maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are not considered more likely than not to be realized. Based on current analysis, including increased level of income and ability to use losses previously limited, we have determined that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. tax loss carryforwards and credits will be realized and have released the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs discussed in Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements, we operated discontinued operations previously included in our Automotive and Railcar segments and former Gaming segment. The sales of each of the businesses closed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and resulted in aggregate pre-tax gains on the sales of discontinued operations attributable to Icahn Enterprises of approximately $1.4 billion.\nSee Note 13, \"Discontinued Operations,\" to the consolidated financial statements, for financial information with respect to each of our discontinued operating businesses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHolding Company Liquidity\nWe are a holding company. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make distributions with respect to depositary units likely will depend on the cash flow resulting from divestitures, equity and debt financings, interest income, returns on our interests in the Investment Funds and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends and distributions. We may pursue various means to raise cash from our subsidiaries. To date, such means include receipt of dividends and distributions from subsidiaries, obtaining loans or other financings based on the asset values of subsidiaries or selling debt or equity securities of subsidiaries through capital market transactions. To the degree any distributions and transfers are impaired or prohibited, our ability to make payments on our debt or distributions on our depositary units could be limited. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. In addition, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.8 billion and total debt of approximately $5.5 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our Holding Company had investments in the Investment Funds with a total fair market value of approximately $5.1 billion. We may redeem our direct investment in the Investment Funds upon notice. See \"Investment Segment Liquidity\" below for additional information with respect to our Investment segment liquidity.\nSale of Businesses and Assets\nOn October 1, 2018, we closed on the sales of Federal-Mogul and Tropicana and on December 5, 2018, we closed on the sale of ARI. In addition, during 2018, we sold our remaining railcars previously owned by ARL. These dispositions resulted in aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion during 2018. As part of the proceeds from the sale of Federal-Mogul, we also acquired a non-controlling interest in the purchaser, Tenneco, Inc. (\"Tenneco\"), represented by an aggregate of approximately 29.5 million voting and non-voting shares of Tenneco common stock with a fair market value of approximately $1.2 billion at the time of sale. Refer to Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn addition, on December 5, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Ferrous Resources. The transaction is expected to close in 2019 and, if consummated, will provide additional liquidity to our Holding Company.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 29, 2019, we received $60 million in connection with CVR Energy's purchase of all remaining common units of CVR Refining, which included all common units of CVR Refining held directly by us.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, CVR Energy declared a quarterly dividend which should result in an additional $53 million in dividends payable to us in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, Tenneco declared a quarterly dividend which should result in an additional $7 million in dividends payable to us in the first quarter of 2019.\nHolding Company Borrowings and Availability\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.000% senior unsecured notes due 2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2022\n</td> <td>1,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.250% senior unsecured notes due 2022\n</td> <td>1,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2024\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025\n</td> <td>748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHolding Company debt consists of various issues of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued by Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Finance Corp. and guaranteed by Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Interest on each of the senior unsecured notes are payable semi-annually.\nThe indentures governing our senior unsecured notes described above restrict the payment of cash distributions, the purchase of equity interests or the purchase, redemption, defeasance or acquisition of debt subordinated to the senior unsecured notes. The indentures also restrict the incurrence of debt or the issuance of disqualified stock, as defined in the indentures, with certain exceptions. In addition, the indentures require that on each quarterly determination date, we and the guarantor of the notes (currently only Icahn Enterprises Holdings) maintain certain minimum financial ratios, as defined therein. The indentures also restrict the creation of liens, mergers, consolidations and sales of substantially all of our assets, and transactions with affiliates. Additionally, each of the senior unsecured notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018 are subject to optional redemption premiums in the event we redeem any of the notes prior to certain dates as described in the indentures.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants, including maintaining certain minimum financial ratios, as defined in the indentures. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, based on covenants in the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, we are permitted to incur approximately $2.0 billion of additional indebtedness.\nDistributions on Depositary Units\nOn February 26, 2019, the Board of Directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $2.00 per depositary unit. The quarterly distribution is payable in either cash or additional depositary units, at the election of each depositary unitholder and will be paid on or about April 17, 2019 to depositary unitholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared four quarterly distributions aggregating $7.00 per depositary unit. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates elected to receive their proportionate share of these distributions in depositary units. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 91.7% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2018. In connection with these distributions, aggregate cash distributions to all depositary unitholders was $95 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe declaration and payment of distributions is reviewed quarterly by Icahn Enterprises GP's board of directors based upon a review of our balance sheet and cash flow, our expected capital and liquidity requirements, the provisions of our partnership agreement and provisions in our financing arrangements governing distributions, and keeping in mind that limited partners subject to U.S. federal income tax have recognized income on our earnings even if they do not receive distributions that could be used to satisfy any resulting tax obligations. The payment of future distributions will be determined by the board of directors quarterly, based upon the factors described above and other factors that it deems relevant at the time that declaration of a distribution is considered. Payments of distributions are subject to certain restrictions, including certain restrictions on our subsidiaries which limit their ability to distribute dividends to us. There can be no assurance as to whether or in what amounts any future distributions might be paid.\nInvestment Segment Liquidity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we invested approximately $1.7 billion in the Investment Funds, net of redemptions, and affiliates of Mr. Icahn (excluding us and our subsidiaries) invested $310 million in the Investment Funds. In addition to investments by us and other affiliates of Mr. Icahn, the Investment Funds historically have access to significant amounts of cash available from prime brokerage lines of credit, subject to customary terms and market conditions.\nAdditionally, our Investment segment liquidity is driven by the investment activities and performance of the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2018, the Investment Funds' had a net short notional exposure of 24%. The Investment Funds' long exposure was 69% (67% long equity and 2% long credit and other) and its short exposure was 93% (88% short equity and 5% short credit and other). The notional exposure represents the ratio of the notional exposure of the Investment Funds' invested capital to the net asset value of the Investment Funds at December 31, 2018.\nOf the Investment Funds' 69% long exposure, 68% was comprised of the fair value of its long positions (with certain adjustments) and 1% was comprised of single name equity forward contracts and credit contracts. Of the Investment Funds' 93% short exposure, 4% was comprised of the fair value of our short positions and 89% was comprised of short credit default swap contracts and short broad market index swap derivative contracts.\nWith respect to both our long positions that are not notionalized (68% long exposure) and our short positions that are not notionalized (4% short), each 1% change in exposure as a result of purchases or sales (assuming no change in value) would have a 1% impact on our cash and cash equivalents (as a percentage of net asset value). Changes in exposure as a result of purchases and sales as well as adverse changes in market value would also have an effect on funds available to us pursuant to prime brokerage lines of credit.\nWith respect to the notional value of our other short positions (89% short exposure), our liquidity would decrease by the balance sheet unrealized loss if we were to close the positions at year end prices. This would be offset by a release of restricted cash balances collateralizing these positions as well as an increase in funds available to us pursuant to certain prime brokerage lines of credit. If we were to increase our short exposure by adding to these short positions, we would be required to provide cash collateral equal to a small percentage of the initial notional value at counterparties that require cash as collateral and then post additional collateral equal to 100% of the mark to market on adverse changes in fair value. For our counterparties who do not require cash collateral, funds available from lines of credit would decrease.\nOther Segment Liquidity\nSegment Cash and Cash Equivalents\nSegment cash and cash equivalents (excluding our Investment segment) consists of the following:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food Packaging\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metals\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Fashion\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Mining segment had $11 million of cash and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nSegment Borrowings and Availability\nSegment debt consists of the following:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food Packaging\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metals\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Fashion\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mining\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Mining segment had $55 million of debt included in liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nOur segments have additional borrowing availability under certain revolving credit facilities as summarized below:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food Packaging\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metals\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Fashion\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above outstanding debt and borrowing availability with respect to each of our continuing operating segments reflects third-party obligations.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities for 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to our Energy segment resulting from changes in the biofuel blending obligation caused by changes in RINs prices.\nCapital expenditures are primarily from our Energy, Automotive and Mining segments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Energy segment's capital expenditures were $102 million, primarily for maintenance, our Automotive segment's capital expenditures were $66 million, primarily for store improvements, and our Mining segment's capital expenditures were $40 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Energy segment's capital expenditures were $120 million\nand $133 million, respectively, our Automotive segment's capital expenditures were $86 million and $37 million, respectively, and our Mining segment's capital expenditures were $38 million and $22 million, respectively.\nAcquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, primarily relates to our Automotive segment. Our Automotive segment's acquisitions included various service businesses aggregating $15 million in 2018, the acquisitions of Precision Tune, American Driveline and various other service businesses aggregating $218 million in 2017 and its acquisitions of Pep Boys and certain other businesses aggregating $971 million in 2016. In addition, our Food Packaging segment acquired a casings manufacturer for $31 million in 2017 and had other acquisitions of $4 million in 2016, and our Energy segment acquired a nitrogen fertilizer business for common units of CVR Partners and $64 million of net cash consideration in 2016. Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired in 2016 were offset by $30 million of cash held by casino properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey which we obtained a controlling equity interest in through the conversion of our prior debt investment in such casino business.\nProceeds from sale of assets are primarily due to our Real Estate segment's dispositions of certain properties in 2018 and 2017. Proceeds from sale of assets for 2016 primarily relates to our Automotive segment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our Railcar segment received $120 million from our Holding Company for the repayment of an intercompany loan and during the year ended December 31, 2016, our Railcar segment paid $125 million to our Holding Company for the issuance of the intercompany loan.\nDistributions to non-controlling interests were from our Energy segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, relating to its regular quarterly dividends and distributions, excluding payments made to us.\nNet distributions to and contributions from our Holding Company include the dividends and distributions paid by our Energy segment of $192 million, $148 million and $142 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as well as by our Real Estate segment of $543 million, $374 million and $4 million, respectively, and by our Railcar segment of $0 million, $47 million and $75 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our Automotive segment also distributed $100 million to our Holding Company. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Automotive segment received funds in the form of investments from our Holding Company of $365 million, $504 million and $1,042 million, respectively, for the acquisition of businesses, investments in 767 Auto Leasing LLC and costs associated with our Automotive segment's multi-year transformation plan. Our other operating segments received funds in the form of loans and investments from our Holding Company aggregating $34 million, $28 million and $81 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Food Packaging segment also received $50 million in 2018 in connection with a rights offering, including $44 million from our Holding Company.\nDiscontinued Operations\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal-Mogul\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tropicana\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARI\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transactions with Holding Company\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal-Mogul\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tropicana\n</td> <td>(55\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARI\n</td> <td>(119\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(580\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal-Mogul\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tropicana\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ARI\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net contributions from (distributions to) Holding Company\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(251\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations was primarily due to net cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI. However, Federal-Mogul's cash flows from operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was also significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to a buildup of inventory in 2017 compared to a reduction of inventory in 2016.\nOur cash flows from investing activities from discontinued operations were primarily due to capital expenditures for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI.\nOur cash flows from financing activities from discontinued operations were primarily due to net debt transactions for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI. In addition, ARI had aggregate quarterly dividends of $23 million, $31 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $14 million, $19 million and $19 million were paid to us. In 2018, Federal-Mogul also received $56 million from us in connection with a certain litigation reserve.\nConsolidated Capital Expenditures\nRefer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" for a reconciliation of our segments' capital expenditures to consolidated capital expenditures for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nWe estimate that our consolidated capital expenditures for our continuing operating businesses to be approximately $239 million for our Energy segment, a majority of which is planned for maintenance, $60 million for our Automotive segment, primarily for strategic priorities and growth, and approximately $63 million in the aggregate for all other segments.\nConsolidated Contractual Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table reflects, at December 31, 2018, our contractual cash obligations, subject to certain conditions, due over the indicated periods:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and other post-retirement benefit plans\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above excludes debt obligations of $55 million and related interest payments of $14 million relating to our Mining segment, which is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nCertain of CVR Energy's and PSC Metals' facilities are environmentally impaired. As of December 31, 2018, CVR Energy and PSC Metals have recorded environmental liabilities of $8 million and $27 million, respectively. For further discussion regarding these commitments, among others, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs discussed in Note 4, Investments and Related Matters,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, we have contractual liabilities of $468 million related to securities sold, not yet purchased as of December 31, 2018. This amount has not been included in the table above as maturity is not subject to a contract and cannot be properly estimated.\nConsolidated Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have off-balance sheet risk related to investment activities associated with certain financial instruments, including futures, options, credit default swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased. For additional information regarding these arrangements, refer to Note 6, Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Among others, estimates are used when accounting for valuation of investments. Estimates used in determining fair value measurements include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flow assumptions, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans, settlement plans for litigation and contingencies, and appropriate discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nExcept as described below, no provision has been made for federal, state, local or foreign income taxes on the results of operations generated by partnership activities as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners. Our corporate subsidiaries account for their income taxes under the asset and liability method.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nOn December 22, 2017, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Legislation\") was enacted in the United States, significantly revising certain U.S. corporate income tax provisions; including, among other items, a reduction of the U.S. corporate rate from 35% to 21%, effective for tax year beginning after December 31, 2017; the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system; and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, (or, if greater, November 2, 2017) of a specified foreign corporation\u201d which includes controlled foreign corporations and other foreign corporations which have at least one U.S. corporate shareholder that owns 10% or more of the value or voting power of such foreign corporation. We estimated the impact of the Tax Legislation on our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Legislation and guidance available at the date of this filing and as a result have recorded adjustments to the various tax balances, current, long-term and deferred tax assets and liabilities, all during the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the Tax Legislation was enacted. The actual amounts recorded in 2017 were not significantly different from the provisional amounts estimated in the prior year tax provision.\nManagement periodically evaluates all evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets is still needed. For each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, we concluded, based on the projections of taxable income, that certain of our corporate subsidiaries more likely than not will realize a partial benefit from their deferred tax assets and loss carry forwards. Ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon, among other factors, our corporate subsidiaries' ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods and is subject to change depending on the tax laws in effect in the years in which the carryforwards are used.\nSee Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our income taxes.\nValuation of Investments\nThe fair value of our investments, including securities sold, not yet purchased, is based on observable market prices when available. Securities owned by the Investment Funds that are listed on a securities exchange are valued at their last sales price on the primary securities exchange on which such securities are traded on such date. Securities that are not listed on any exchange but are traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the last bid\u201d and ask\u201d price for such security on such date. Securities and other instruments for which market quotes are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the applicable general partner. For some investments little market activity may exist; management's\ndetermination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment.\nLong-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWe calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various definite-lived assets. When assets are placed in service, we make estimates of what we believe are their reasonable useful lives.\nLong-lived assets held and used by our various operating segments and long-lived assets to be disposed of are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as vacancies and rejected leases and reduced production capacity, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Definite-lived assets held by our various segments are periodically reviewed for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required analysis and an impairment loss is recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, held by our various segments are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment is necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss, equal to the difference (limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the tested reporting unit), is recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated goodwill was $247 million, primarily within our Automotive segment. We perform the annual goodwill impairment test for our Automotive segment as of October 1 of each year. Based on our annual goodwill impairment analysis for our Automotive segment, we determined that the carrying value of its Parts reporting unit exceeded its fair value and as a result, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to the Parts reporting unit. We also determined that the fair value of our Automotive segment's Service reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value and therefore, no impairment is required. As of December 31, 2018, our Automotive segment had remaining goodwill of $241 million, which is allocated entirely to its Service reporting unit.\nWe base the fair value of our reporting units on consideration of various valuation methodologies, including projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved (\"DCF\"). Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective. The inputs used to determine the fair values of our reporting units, including future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates and other assumptions involves a significant degree of judgment.\nSee Note 5, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the fair value measurements of our long-live assets as well as goodwill and intangible assets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to us.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our present business and the results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Report.\nExecutive Overview\nIntroduction\nIcahn Enterprises L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises\u201d) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. ( Icahn Enterprises Holdings\u201d) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. References to \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nIcahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Icahn Enterprises and conduct substantially all of its operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to allocations to the general and limited partners. We do not discuss Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings separately unless we believe it is necessary to an understanding of the businesses.\nWe are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses: Investment, Energy, Automotive, Food Packaging, Metals, Real Estate, Home Fashion and Mining. We also report the results of our Holding Company, which includes the results of certain subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings (unless otherwise noted), and investment activity and expenses associated with our Holding Company. Our historical results also report the results of our Railcar segment through the date we sold our last remaining railcars on lease, which occurred in the third quarter of 2018.\nSignificant Transactions and Developments\nSignificant transactions and developments affecting our results of operations and liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2018 are summarized as follows:\nSale of Discontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we closed on the sales of Federal-Mogul LLC (\"Federal-Mogul\"), Tropicana Entertainment Inc. (\"Tropicana\") and American Railcar Industries, Inc. (\"ARI\"). As a result of the transactions, our Holding Company received approximately $3.2 billion in aggregate cash proceeds and approximately $1.2 billion of fair value equity in Tenneco, Inc., resulting in the recognition of aggregate pre-tax gains on the sales of discontinued operations attributable to Icahn Enterprises of approximately $1.4 billion.\nPending Sale of Ferrous Resources. On December 5, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Ferrous Resources Ltd. for total consideration of $550 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Financial Results\nOur operating businesses comprise consolidated subsidiaries which operate in various industries and are managed on a decentralized basis. Revenues for our continuing operating businesses primarily consist of net sales of various products, services revenue, franchisor operations and leasing of real estate. Due to the structure and nature of our business, we primarily discuss the results of operations by individual reporting segment in order to better understand our consolidated operating performance. Certain other financial information is discussed on a consolidated basis following our segment discussion, including other revenues and expenses included in continuing operations as well as our results from discontinued operations. In addition to the summarized financial results below, refer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of each of our reporting segment's results of continuing operations to our consolidated results.\nThe comparability of our summarized consolidated financial results presented below is affected by, among other factors, (i) the performance of the Investment Funds, (ii) the results of our Energy segment's operations, impacted by the relationship of its refined product prices and prices for crude oil and other feedstocks, (iii) impairment charges, primarily in our Automotive segment in 2018 and our Energy segment in 2016, (iv) acquisitions of businesses, primarily in our Automotive segment during 2017 and 2016, (v) gains on dispositions of assets, primarily in our Railcar and Real Estate segments in 2017, including the impact of the disposed income generating assets on subsequent operations, (vi) our Holding Company's unrealized equity investment gains and losses and (vii) the enactment of tax legislation in the United States in 2017. Refer to our respective segment discussions and \"Other Consolidated Results of Operations,\" below for further discussion. \nInvestment\nWe invest our proprietary capital through various private investment funds (the \"Investment Funds\"). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $5.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total fair market value of investments in the Investment Funds made by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (excluding us) was approximately $5.0 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.\nOur Investment segment's results of operations are reflected in net income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Investment segment's net income (loss) is driven by the amount of funds allocated to the Investment Funds and the performance of the underlying investments in the Investment Funds. Future funds allocated to the Investment Funds may increase or decrease based on the contributions and redemptions by our Holding Company and by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates. Additionally, historical performance results of the Investment Funds are not indicative of future results as past market\nconditions, investment opportunities and investment decisions may not occur in the future. Changes in general market conditions coupled with changes in exposure to short and long positions have significant impact on our Investment segment's results of operations and the comparability of results of operations year over year and as such, future results of operations will be impacted by our future exposures and future market conditions, which may not be consistent with prior trends. Refer to the \"Investment Segment Liquidity\" section of our \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" discussion for additional information regarding our Investment segment's exposure as of December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Investment Funds' returns were 7.9%, 2.1% and (20.3)%, respectively. Our Investment Funds' returns represent a weighted-average composite of the average returns, net of expenses. The following table sets forth the performance attribution for the Investment Funds' returns:\n\nThe following table presents net income (loss) for our Investment segment:\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nFor 2018, the Investment Funds' positive performance was driven by net gains in their short positions offset in part by net losses in their long positions. The positive performance of our Investment segment's short positions was driven by the positive performance of broad market hedges of $642 million and the aggregate performance of multiple other short positions with net gains across various sectors, primarily the energy sector. The negative performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by losses from two consumer, cyclical sector investments, a basic material sector investment, two consumer, non-cyclical sector investments, a technology sector investment and an industrial sector investment with losses aggregating approximately $1.4 billion. The aggregate performance of investments with net losses across various other sectors accounted for an additional negative performance of our Investment segment's long positions. Losses in long positions were offset in part by gains from a consumer, non-cyclical sector investment, a technology sector investment and an energy sector investment with gains aggregating approximately $1.3 billion.\nFor 2017, the Investment Funds' positive performance was driven by net gains in their long positions, offset in part by net losses in their short positions. The positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by gains from two consumer, non-cyclical sector investments, a basic materials sector investment, an energy sector investment and a consumer, cyclical sector investment aggregating approximately $1.6 billion. The aggregate performance of investments with gains across various other sectors accounted for the additional positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions, offset in part by the aggregate performance of investments with losses in the financial sector. Losses in short positions were attributable to the negative performance of broad market hedges of approximately $2.1 billion and the negative performance of various other short positions across multiple sectors. Losses in short positions were offset in part by the positive performance of three consumer, cyclical sector short positions aggregating $627 million.\nFor 2016, the Investment Funds' negative performance was driven by net losses in their short positions, offset in part by net gains in their long positions. Losses in short positions were attributable to the negative performance of broad market hedges of approximately $1.5 billion, as well as the negative performance of other short positions, primarily in the consumer, cyclical sector. The positive performance of our Investment segment's long positions was driven by gains from a certain basic materials sector investment of $561 million. The aggregate performance of investments with gains across various other sectors were offset by the aggregate performance of investments with losses primarily in the technology and consumer non-cyclical sectors.\nEnergy\nOur Energy segment is primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing businesses. The sale of petroleum products accounted for approximately 95%, 94% and 93% of our Energy segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe results of operations of the petroleum business are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks that are processed and blended into petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel, that are produced by a refinery (\"refined products\"). The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond our Energy segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as gasoline and other refined products. This supply and demand depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum business applies first-in, first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact gross margin in the short-term fluctuations in the market price of inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the petroleum business' results of operations is influenced by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which requires it to either blend renewable fuels\u201d in with its transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and the future cost of RINs for the petroleum business is difficult to estimate. Additionally, the cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of the petroleum business' petroleum products, as well as the fuel blending performed at its refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Refer to Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of RINs.\nThe following table presents our Energy segment's net sales, cost of goods sold and gross margin:\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.1 billion (19%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of an increase in refined products crack spreads, partially offset by decreased sales volumes. Our nitrogen fertilizer business' net sales increased over the comparable periods due to higher sales prices and volumes.\nCost of goods sold for our Energy segment increased by $654 million (11%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of a higher cost of consumed crude oil offset in part by a decrease in RINs costs. The increase in consumed crude oil costs was due to an increase in crude oil prices, offset in part by a decrease in consumed crude volume. The net cost of RINs was favorably impacted by a reduction in the petroleum segment's RFS obligation and reduced market pricing.\nGross margin for our Energy segment increased by $482 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 9% and 3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with an increase attributable to our petroleum business. The increase in the gross margin as a percentage of net sales for our petroleum business was primarily due to higher gross margins per barrel resulting from a higher refined product crack spreads and reduced RINs costs, offset in part by lower sales volumes.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.2 billion (25%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our petroleum business as a\nresult of higher sales prices for transportation fuels and byproducts. This increase was offset in part by our nitrogen fertilizer business primarily due to a decrease in sales prices for its products.\nCost of goods sold for our Energy segment increased by approximately $1.2 billion (25%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to our petroleum business as a result of higher cost of consumed crude oil, due to higher prices, as well as increased products purchased for resale. This increase was offset in part by our nitrogen fertilizer business primarily due to higher costs in 2016 from inventory and deferred revenue fair value adjustments and decreased current year distribution costs due to the timing of regulatory railcar repairs and maintenance.\nGross margin for our Energy segment increased by $44 million (30%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 3% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for our petroleum business was higher due to higher margins per barrel resulting from an increase in the sales price of gasoline and distillates. Cost of consumed oil per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 21% as compared to the prior year. This increase was offset by a decrease attributable to our nitrogen fertilizer business.\nAutomotive\nOur Automotive segment's results of operations are generally driven by the distribution and installation of automotive aftermarket parts and are affected by the relative strength of automotive part replacement trends, among other factors. Our automotive aftermarket parts business is in a highly competitive industry and is smaller than several of its competitors, who have greater financial resources and operational capabilities. Acquisitions in recent years within our Automotive segment, including our acquisitions of The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack (\"Pep Boys\") in 2016 and the franchise businesses of Precision Tune Auto Care (\"Precision Tune\") and American Driveline Systems, the franchisor of AAMCO and licensor of Cottman Transmission service centers (\"American Driveline\"), in 2017, provided operating synergies, expanded our market presence, strengthened our parts distribution channel and enhanced our Automotive segment's ability to better service its customers. Our Automotive segment's results of operations also include automotive services labor. Automotive services labor revenues are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated statements of operations, however, the sale of any installed parts or materials related to automotive services are included in net sales. Therefore, we discuss the combined results of our automotive net sales and automotive services labor revenues below.\nOur Automotive segment is in the process of implementing a multi-year transformation plan, which includes the integration and restructuring of the operations of Pep Boys, IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC (\"IEH Auto\") and the franchise businesses of Precision Tune and American Driveline. Our Automotive segment's priorities include:\n \u2022 Positioning the service business to take advantage of opportunities in the do-it-for-me market and vehicle fleets; \n \u2022 Optimizing the value of the commercial parts distribution business in high volume markets; \n \u2022 Improving inventory management across Icahn Automotive's parts and tire distribution network; \n \u2022 Optimizing the store and warehouse footprint through openings, closings, consolidations and conversions by market; \n \u2022 Digital initiatives including a new e-commerce platform and enhanced e-fulfillment capabilities; \n \u2022 Investment in customer experience initiatives such as enhanced customer loyalty programs and selective upgrades in facilities; \n \u2022 Investment in employees with focus on training and career development investments; and \n \u2022 Business process improvements, including investments in our supply chain and information technology capabilities.  The following table presents our Automotive segment's operating revenue, cost of revenue and gross margin:\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales and other revenue from operations for our Automotive segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $135 million (5%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was attributable to an increase in automotive services revenues. On an organic basis, automotive services revenue increased by $52 million (5%) due to growing do-it-for-me and fleet businesses. Acquisitions accounted for an additional increase in automotive services revenue of $94 million (including $27 million from franchise royalty revenues), offset in part by a decrease of $11 million due to store closures. Aftermarket parts sales, including commercial and retail sales, remained flat over the comparable period as retail sales decreased by $24 million (4%) offset in part by an increase in commercial sales. Commercial sales increased by $67 million (7%) on an organic basis, driven by increases in IEH Auto sales as well as growth in Pep Boys commercial programs, as well as an additional $22 million from acquisitions, offset in part by $65 million due to the effects of the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606.\nCost of goods sold and other expenses from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $2 million (0%) compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of goods sold and automotive services labor increased by $62 million which was more than offset by the effects of the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606 as discussed above. Gross margin on net sales and automotive services labor revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $137 million (18%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and automotive services labor revenues was 31% and 27% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The improvement in gross margin primarily reflects higher margin percentages from franchisor operations as well as higher margins from automotive services due to cost improvements and selective price increases.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales and other revenue from operations for our Automotive segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $222 million (9%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was attributable to an increase in automotive services revenues of $188 million and an increase in aftermarket parts sales of $34 million. These increases in automotive services and aftermarket parts sales were due in part to the inclusion of Pep-Boys for the full twelve months in 2017 compared to eleven months in 2016. Automotive services also increased $21 million due to the acquisitions of Precision Tune and American Driveline in 2017.\nCost of goods sold and other expenses from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $118 million (6%), as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was due to volume increases. Gross margin on net sales and automotive services labor revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $104 million (16%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and automotive services labor revenues was 27% and 26% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The improvement in gross margin primarily reflects higher margin percentages from franchisor operations, which were first acquired in 2017, as well as higher margins from automotive services due to cost improvements and selective price increases.\nFood Packaging\nOur Food packaging segment's results of operations are primarily driven by the production and sale of cellulosic, fibrous and plastic casings for the processed meat and poultry industry and derives a majority of its total net sales from customers located outside the United States.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $3 million (1%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The increase was due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange, offset in part due to lower volume and unfavorable price and product mix. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $19 million (6%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period due to higher raw material and labor costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 20% and 24% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales over the comparable periods was primarily due to increasing raw material labor costs and lower fixed cost absorption.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $63 million (19%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, primarily from acquisitions, offset in part by unfavorable price and product mix and foreign currency exchange. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $48 million (19%) as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was flat at 24% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nMetals\nThe scrap metals business is highly cyclical and is substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the United States and other global markets. Ferrous and non-ferrous scrap has been historically vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn or stagnation.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $57 million (14%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to higher ferrous shipment volumes and higher average selling prices for most grades of material, partially offset by lower non-ferrous auto residue pricing and lower non-ferrous volume. Ferrous selling prices increased due to higher market pricing as domestic mill production benefited from trade cases and the effects of additional tariffs on steel imports. Improved consumer market pricing was also driven primarily by the increased demand from domestic steel mills.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $52 million (13%) compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher ferrous shipment volumes, as discussed above, and to increased material costs due to higher market prices. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was flat at 5% for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $142 million (53%) as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to higher ferrous, non-ferrous and non-ferrous auto residue shipment volumes and higher average selling prices. Ferrous shipment volumes increased due to improved demand from domestic steel mills and improved flow of raw materials into the recycling yards driven by increased market pricing. Additionally, during 2017, a major new steel mill came on line which increased demand for scrap metal. Domestic mill production has benefited from trade cases and speculation regarding the recent probe into steel imports. Improved consumer market pricing was also driven primarily by the increased demand from domestic steel mills. Non-ferrous shipment volumes increased 46% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to utilization of the capital investment in aluminum processing capabilities at one of our facilities made in late 2016, while higher pricing reflected higher terminal market prices in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $105 million (37%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher shipment volumes, as discussed above, and to increased material costs due to higher market prices. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of 6% in the comparable prior year period. The margin percentage improvement was driven by an increased material margin attributed to a continued focus on disciplined buying, higher pricing for non-ferrous auto residue, and by continued efforts to bring processing costs in line with volume and market pricing.\nReal Estate\nReal Estate revenues and expenses primarily include sales of residential units, results from club operations, rental income and expenses, including income from financing leases, and hotel, timeshare and casino operations. Sales of residential units are included in net sales in our consolidated financial statements. Results from club and rental operations, including financing lease income, and hotel, timeshare and casino operations are included in other revenues from operations in our consolidated financial statements. Revenue from our real estate operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were substantially derived from income from club and rental operations.\nHome Fashion\nOur Home Fashion segment is significantly influenced by the overall economic environment, including consumer spending, at the retail level, for home textile products.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $12 million (7%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $18 million (11%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to sales mix and lower sales volume. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 16% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 11% for the comparable prior year period, with the increase primarily due to sale mix.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $12 million (6%) as compared to the comparable prior year period due to lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $6 million (4%) as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to sales mix. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 11% for\nthe year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 14% for the comparable prior year period, with the decrease primarily due to sales mix and inventory obsolescence.\nMining\nOur Mining segment's performance is driven by global iron ore prices and demand for raw materials from Chinese steelmakers. Since acquiring Ferrous Resources Ltd in 2015, our Mining segment has been concentrating on sales in its domestic market, Brazil.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $9 million as compared to the comparable prior year period due to volume increases. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $13 million (22%) compared to the comparable prior year period due to a certain plant operation resuming in 2018, increasing the cost of production to produce a higher quality of iron ore.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $23 million as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to iron ore price increases, offset in part by volume decreases. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $4 million as compared to the comparable prior year period.\nRailcar\nOur Railcar segment's other revenues from operations primarily relates to its railcar leasing revenue. On June 1, 2017 we sold American Railcar Leasing, LLC (\"ARL\") along with a majority of its railcar lease fleet. We sold the remaining railcars previously owned by ARL throughout the remainder of 2017 and the first nine months of 2018.\nHolding Company\nOur Holding Company's results of operations primarily reflect the interest expense on its senior unsecured notes for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We discuss interest expense in consolidation below. In addition, our Holding Company has investment gains and losses from debt and equity investments. During 2018, net loss from investment activities was primarily attributable to an unrealized loss from an equity investment offset in part by unrealized gains from an equity and debt investment. During 2017, unrealized gains from an equity investment was offset in part by unrealized losses from a debt investment. During 2016, net gain from investment activities was primarily due to realized gains from a debt investment.\nOther Consolidated Results of Operations\nGain On Disposition of Assets, Net\nAs discussed in Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements, our Real Estate segment sold two commercial rental properties, resulting in aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of $89 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, our Railcar segment sold its remaining railcars previously owned by ARL, resulting in aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring 2017, we sold ARL along with a majority of its railcar lease fleet, resulting in an aggregate pretax gain on disposition of assets of approximately $1.7 billion recorded by our Railcar segment for the year ended December 31, 2017. In August 2017, our Real Estate segment sold a development property in Las Vegas Nevada, resulting in a pretax gain on disposition of assets of $456 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Real Estate segment also sold additional properties during 2017, primarily within its rental operations, resulting in an additional pretax gain on disposition of assets aggregating $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOur consolidated selling, general and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $117 million (9%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase from our Automotive segment of $132 million primarily due to the inclusion of various acquisitions of automotive businesses as well as costs associated with the growth of the commercial parts business. This increase was offset in part primarily due to our Railcar segment, which decreased due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017, as well as aggregate net decreases within various other segments.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur consolidated selling, general and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $268 million (27%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase from our Automotive segment of $271 million primarily due to the inclusion of the full year impact of Pep Boys in 2017, which was acquired in February 2016, and the acquisitions of Precision Tune, American Driveline and various other acquisitions in 2017, as well as personnel costs associated with integration and increased customer services. There were aggregate net increases within various other segments which were more than offset by a decrease of $21 million from our Investment segment due to a decrease of compensation expense.\nRestructuring\nOur consolidated restructuring, net for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $21 million, $4 million and $5 million, respectively, and was primarily attributable to our Food Packaging segment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Food Packaging segment recorded $9 million of restructuring charges for employee costs relating to certain of its European operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Energy segment recorded $5 million of restructuring charges for employee costs and other exit costs relating to an office closure. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Automotive segment recorded $5 million of restructuring charges primarily for exit costs relating to facility closures. Refer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" to the consolidated financial statements for net restructuring charges recorded by each of our segments.\nImpairment\nRefer to Note 5, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of assets.\nInterest Expense\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOur consolidated interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $131 million (20%) as compared the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to a decrease in due to broker balances over the respective periods, as well as lower interest expense from our Railcar segment due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by higher interest expense from our Holding Company due to debt refinancing in December 2017, resulting in debt with higher interest rates.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $37 million (5%) as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense from our Investment segment attributable to a decrease in due to broker balances over the respective periods, as well as lower interest expense from our Railcar segment due to the sale of ARL in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by higher interest expense from our Energy segment due to a certain debt offering in the second quarter of 2016, as well as higher interest expense from our Holding Company due to our senior unsecured notes refinancing in the first quarter of 2017, which is subject to higher interest rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nCertain of our subsidiaries are partnerships not subject to taxation in our consolidated financial statements and certain other subsidiaries are corporations, or subsidiaries of corporations, subject to taxation in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, our consolidated effective tax rate generally differs from the statutory federal tax rate. Refer to Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes.\nIn addition, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, we analyze all positive and negative evidence and maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are not considered more likely than not to be realized. Based on current analysis, including increased level of income and ability to use losses previously limited, we have determined that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. tax loss carryforwards and credits will be realized and have released the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs discussed in Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements, we operated discontinued operations previously included in our Automotive and Railcar segments and former Gaming segment. The sales of each of the businesses closed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and resulted in aggregate pre-tax gains on the sales of discontinued operations attributable to Icahn Enterprises of approximately $1.4 billion.\nSee Note 13, \"Discontinued Operations,\" to the consolidated financial statements, for financial information with respect to each of our discontinued operating businesses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHolding Company Liquidity\nWe are a holding company. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make distributions with respect to depositary units likely will depend on the cash flow resulting from divestitures, equity and debt financings, interest income, returns on our interests in the Investment Funds and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends and distributions. We may pursue various means to raise cash from our subsidiaries. To date, such means include receipt of dividends and distributions from subsidiaries, obtaining loans or other financings based on the asset values of subsidiaries or selling debt or equity securities of subsidiaries through capital market transactions. To the degree any distributions and transfers are impaired or prohibited, our ability to make payments on our debt or distributions on our depositary units could be limited. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. In addition, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.8 billion and total debt of approximately $5.5 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our Holding Company had investments in the Investment Funds with a total fair market value of approximately $5.1 billion. We may redeem our direct investment in the Investment Funds upon notice. See \"Investment Segment Liquidity\" below for additional information with respect to our Investment segment liquidity.\nSale of Businesses and Assets\nOn October 1, 2018, we closed on the sales of Federal-Mogul and Tropicana and on December 5, 2018, we closed on the sale of ARI. In addition, during 2018, we sold our remaining railcars previously owned by ARL. These dispositions resulted in aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion during 2018. As part of the proceeds from the sale of Federal-Mogul, we also acquired a non-controlling interest in the purchaser, Tenneco, Inc. (\"Tenneco\"), represented by an aggregate of approximately 29.5 million voting and non-voting shares of Tenneco common stock with a fair market value of approximately $1.2 billion at the time of sale. Refer to Note 1, \"Description of Business,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn addition, on December 5, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Ferrous Resources. The transaction is expected to close in 2019 and, if consummated, will provide additional liquidity to our Holding Company.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 29, 2019, we received $60 million in connection with CVR Energy's purchase of all remaining common units of CVR Refining, which included all common units of CVR Refining held directly by us.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, CVR Energy declared a quarterly dividend which should result in an additional $53 million in dividends payable to us in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, Tenneco declared a quarterly dividend which should result in an additional $7 million in dividends payable to us in the first quarter of 2019.\nHolding Company Borrowings and Availability\n\nHolding Company debt consists of various issues of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued by Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Finance Corp. and guaranteed by Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Interest on each of the senior unsecured notes are payable semi-annually.\nThe indentures governing our senior unsecured notes described above restrict the payment of cash distributions, the purchase of equity interests or the purchase, redemption, defeasance or acquisition of debt subordinated to the senior unsecured notes. The indentures also restrict the incurrence of debt or the issuance of disqualified stock, as defined in the indentures, with certain exceptions. In addition, the indentures require that on each quarterly determination date, we and the guarantor of the notes (currently only Icahn Enterprises Holdings) maintain certain minimum financial ratios, as defined therein. The indentures also restrict the creation of liens, mergers, consolidations and sales of substantially all of our assets, and transactions with affiliates. Additionally, each of the senior unsecured notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018 are subject to optional redemption premiums in the event we redeem any of the notes prior to certain dates as described in the indentures.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants, including maintaining certain minimum financial ratios, as defined in the indentures. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, based on covenants in the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, we are permitted to incur approximately $2.0 billion of additional indebtedness.\nDistributions on Depositary Units\nOn February 26, 2019, the Board of Directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $2.00 per depositary unit. The quarterly distribution is payable in either cash or additional depositary units, at the election of each depositary unitholder and will be paid on or about April 17, 2019 to depositary unitholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we declared four quarterly distributions aggregating $7.00 per depositary unit. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates elected to receive their proportionate share of these distributions in depositary units. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 91.7% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2018. In connection with these distributions, aggregate cash distributions to all depositary unitholders was $95 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe declaration and payment of distributions is reviewed quarterly by Icahn Enterprises GP's board of directors based upon a review of our balance sheet and cash flow, our expected capital and liquidity requirements, the provisions of our partnership agreement and provisions in our financing arrangements governing distributions, and keeping in mind that limited partners subject to U.S. federal income tax have recognized income on our earnings even if they do not receive distributions that could be used to satisfy any resulting tax obligations. The payment of future distributions will be determined by the board of directors quarterly, based upon the factors described above and other factors that it deems relevant at the time that declaration of a distribution is considered. Payments of distributions are subject to certain restrictions, including certain restrictions on our subsidiaries which limit their ability to distribute dividends to us. There can be no assurance as to whether or in what amounts any future distributions might be paid.\nInvestment Segment Liquidity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we invested approximately $1.7 billion in the Investment Funds, net of redemptions, and affiliates of Mr. Icahn (excluding us and our subsidiaries) invested $310 million in the Investment Funds. In addition to investments by us and other affiliates of Mr. Icahn, the Investment Funds historically have access to significant amounts of cash available from prime brokerage lines of credit, subject to customary terms and market conditions.\nAdditionally, our Investment segment liquidity is driven by the investment activities and performance of the Investment Funds. As of December 31, 2018, the Investment Funds' had a net short notional exposure of 24%. The Investment Funds' long exposure was 69% (67% long equity and 2% long credit and other) and its short exposure was 93% (88% short equity and 5% short credit and other). The notional exposure represents the ratio of the notional exposure of the Investment Funds' invested capital to the net asset value of the Investment Funds at December 31, 2018.\nOf the Investment Funds' 69% long exposure, 68% was comprised of the fair value of its long positions (with certain adjustments) and 1% was comprised of single name equity forward contracts and credit contracts. Of the Investment Funds' 93% short exposure, 4% was comprised of the fair value of our short positions and 89% was comprised of short credit default swap contracts and short broad market index swap derivative contracts.\nWith respect to both our long positions that are not notionalized (68% long exposure) and our short positions that are not notionalized (4% short), each 1% change in exposure as a result of purchases or sales (assuming no change in value) would have a 1% impact on our cash and cash equivalents (as a percentage of net asset value). Changes in exposure as a result of purchases and sales as well as adverse changes in market value would also have an effect on funds available to us pursuant to prime brokerage lines of credit.\nWith respect to the notional value of our other short positions (89% short exposure), our liquidity would decrease by the balance sheet unrealized loss if we were to close the positions at year end prices. This would be offset by a release of restricted cash balances collateralizing these positions as well as an increase in funds available to us pursuant to certain prime brokerage lines of credit. If we were to increase our short exposure by adding to these short positions, we would be required to provide cash collateral equal to a small percentage of the initial notional value at counterparties that require cash as collateral and then post additional collateral equal to 100% of the mark to market on adverse changes in fair value. For our counterparties who do not require cash collateral, funds available from lines of credit would decrease.\nOther Segment Liquidity\nSegment Cash and Cash Equivalents\nSegment cash and cash equivalents (excluding our Investment segment) consists of the following:\n\nOur Mining segment had $11 million of cash and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nSegment Borrowings and Availability\nSegment debt consists of the following:\n\nOur Mining segment had $55 million of debt included in liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nOur segments have additional borrowing availability under certain revolving credit facilities as summarized below:\n\nThe above outstanding debt and borrowing availability with respect to each of our continuing operating segments reflects third-party obligations. Certain terms of financings for certain of our businesses impose restrictions on the business' ability to transfer funds to us, including restrictions on dividends, distribution, loans and other transactions. See Note 10, \"Debt,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our segment debt, including information relating to maturities, interest rates and borrowing availabilities.\nSubsidiary Payments for Acquisition\nOn January 29, 2019, CVR Energy paid $241 million, excluding payments to us, for the acquisition of the remaining common units of CVR Refining from non-controlling interests.\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nOur Holding Company's cash flows are generally driven by payments and proceeds associated with our senior unsecured debt obligations and payments and proceeds associated with equity transactions with Icahn Enterprises' depositary unitholders. Additionally, our Holding Company's cash flows include transactions with our Investment and other operating segments. Our Investment segment's cash flows are primarily driven by investment transactions, which are included in net cash flows from operating activities due to the nature of its business, as well as contributions to and distributions from Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (including Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings), which are included in net cash flows from financing activities. Our other operating segments' cash flows are driven by the activities and performance of each business as well as transactions with our Holding Company, as discussed below.\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for Icahn Enterprises' reporting segments and our Holding Company:\n\nEliminations\nEliminations in the table above relate to our Holding Company's transactions with our Investment and other operating segments. Our Holding Company's net (investments in) distributions from the Investments Funds are included in cash flows from investing activities for our Holding Company and cash flows from financing activities for our Investment segment. Our Holding Company's net distributions from (investments in) our other operating segments are included in cash flows from investing activities for our Holding Company and cash flows from financing activities for our other operating segments. In addition, our Holding Company received loan proceeds from our Railcar segment in 2016 and repaid the loan in 2017 and which is included in cash flows from financing activities for our Holding Company and cash flows from investing activities for our other operating segments.\nHolding Company\n\nThe increases in interest payments over the comparable periods are due to higher interest rates on certain of our senior unsecured notes due to certain debt refinancings in the first and fourth quarters of 2017.\nNet cash receipts (payments) for income taxes, net of refunds is net of tax sharing receipts from certain of our consolidated subsidiaries aggregating $27 million, $28 million and $45 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProceeds from the sale of businesses includes proceeds from the sales of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI in 2018 and ARL in 2017 (and residual sales of ARL's remaining railcars in 2018). The cash flows with respect to each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented and the cash proceeds from each of the sales remain with our Holding Company in continuing operations.\nPayments to acquire additional interests in subsidiaries during 2018 relates to the acquisition of the remaining interests in a hotel, timeshare and casino resort property in Aruba, previously a subsidiary of Tropicana, in which we had an indirect majority controlling interest in. During 2017, we increased our ownership in Federal-Mogul and Tropicana and during 2016, we increased our ownership in Viskase.\nDuring 2017, we received $600 million in connection with a rights offering for Icahn Enterprises depositary units as well as $12 million from our general partner in connection with the rights offering in order to maintain its aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in Icahn Enterprises.\nNet (investments in) distributions from the Investment Funds, Net distributions from (investments in) other operating segments and Note (repayment) proceeds from other operating segments are eliminated in consolidation and discussed further below.\nInvestment Segment\nOur Investment segment's cash flows from operating activities for the comparable periods were attributable to its net investment transactions.\nOur Investment segment's cash flows from financing activities for the comparable periods were due to contributions from, and distributions to, our Holding Company and Mr. Icahn and his affiliates. Our Investment segment had net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, which included our approximately $1.7 billion net investment in the Investment Funds as well as $310 million received from Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (excluding us). For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Investment segment had net cash provided by financing activities of $1.9 billion which included our $1.3 billion net investment in the Investment Funds as well as $600 million received from Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (excluding us). For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Investment segment had net cash used in financing activities of $552 million due to distributions paid to our Holding Company of approximately $1.1 billion, offset in part by net contributions from Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (excluding us) of $498 million.\nOther Operating Segments\n\nOur other operating segments' net cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to our Energy segment's positive results from operations for all periods, and for 2017 and 2016, were also attributable to our Railcar segment prior to the sale of its railcar lease fleet.\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities for 2018 was primarily attributable to our Real Estate segment receiving payment for its mortgage receivables relating to its 2017 sale of a development property in Las Vegas, Nevada, offset in part by changes in operating assets and liabilities for our Energy and Automotive segments. Changes in operating assets and liabilities for 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to our Energy segment resulting from changes in the biofuel blending obligation caused by changes in RINs prices.\nCapital expenditures are primarily from our Energy, Automotive and Mining segments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Energy segment's capital expenditures were $102 million, primarily for maintenance, our Automotive segment's capital expenditures were $66 million, primarily for store improvements, and our Mining segment's capital expenditures were $40 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Energy segment's capital expenditures were $120 million\nand $133 million, respectively, our Automotive segment's capital expenditures were $86 million and $37 million, respectively, and our Mining segment's capital expenditures were $38 million and $22 million, respectively.\nAcquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, primarily relates to our Automotive segment. Our Automotive segment's acquisitions included various service businesses aggregating $15 million in 2018, the acquisitions of Precision Tune, American Driveline and various other service businesses aggregating $218 million in 2017 and its acquisitions of Pep Boys and certain other businesses aggregating $971 million in 2016. In addition, our Food Packaging segment acquired a casings manufacturer for $31 million in 2017 and had other acquisitions of $4 million in 2016, and our Energy segment acquired a nitrogen fertilizer business for common units of CVR Partners and $64 million of net cash consideration in 2016. Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired in 2016 were offset by $30 million of cash held by casino properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey which we obtained a controlling equity interest in through the conversion of our prior debt investment in such casino business.\nProceeds from sale of assets are primarily due to our Real Estate segment's dispositions of certain properties in 2018 and 2017. Proceeds from sale of assets for 2016 primarily relates to our Automotive segment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our Railcar segment received $120 million from our Holding Company for the repayment of an intercompany loan and during the year ended December 31, 2016, our Railcar segment paid $125 million to our Holding Company for the issuance of the intercompany loan.\nDistributions to non-controlling interests were from our Energy segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, relating to its regular quarterly dividends and distributions, excluding payments made to us.\nNet distributions to and contributions from our Holding Company include the dividends and distributions paid by our Energy segment of $192 million, $148 million and $142 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as well as by our Real Estate segment of $543 million, $374 million and $4 million, respectively, and by our Railcar segment of $0 million, $47 million and $75 million, respectively.

Our other operating segments received funds in the form of loans and investments from our Holding Company aggregating $34 million, $28 million and $81 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Food Packaging segment also received $50 million in 2018 in connection with a rights offering, including $44 million from our Holding Company.\nDiscontinued Operations\n\nOur cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations was primarily due to net cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI. However, Federal-Mogul's cash flows from operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was also significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to a buildup of inventory in 2017 compared to a reduction of inventory in 2016.\nOur cash flows from investing activities from discontinued operations were primarily due to capital expenditures for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI.\nOur cash flows from financing activities from discontinued operations were primarily due to net debt transactions for each of Federal-Mogul, Tropicana and ARI. In addition, ARI had aggregate quarterly dividends of $23 million, $31 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $14 million, $19 million and $19 million were paid to us. In 2018, Federal-Mogul also received $56 million from us in connection with a certain litigation reserve.\nConsolidated Capital Expenditures\nRefer to Note 12, \"Segment and Geographic Reporting,\" for a reconciliation of our segments' capital expenditures to consolidated capital expenditures for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nWe estimate that our consolidated capital expenditures for our continuing operating businesses to be approximately $239 million for our Energy segment, a majority of which is planned for maintenance, $60 million for our Automotive segment, primarily for strategic priorities and growth, and approximately $63 million in the aggregate for all other segments.\nConsolidated Contractual Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table reflects, at December 31, 2018, our contractual cash obligations, subject to certain conditions, due over the indicated periods:\n\nThe table above excludes debt obligations of $55 million and related interest payments of $14 million relating to our Mining segment, which is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.\nCertain of CVR Energy's and PSC Metals' facilities are environmentally impaired. As of December 31, 2018, CVR Energy and PSC Metals have recorded environmental liabilities of $8 million and $27 million, respectively. For further discussion regarding these commitments, among others, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs discussed in Note 4, Investments and Related Matters,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, we have contractual liabilities of $468 million related to securities sold, not yet purchased as of December 31, 2018. This amount has not been included in the table above as maturity is not subject to a contract and cannot be properly estimated.\nConsolidated Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have off-balance sheet risk related to investment activities associated with certain financial instruments, including futures, options, credit default swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased. For additional information regarding these arrangements, refer to Note 6, Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Among others, estimates are used when accounting for valuation of investments. Estimates used in determining fair value measurements include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flow assumptions, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans, settlement plans for litigation and contingencies, and appropriate discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nExcept as described below, no provision has been made for federal, state, local or foreign income taxes on the results of operations generated by partnership activities as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners. Our corporate subsidiaries account for their income taxes under the asset and liability method.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nOn December 22, 2017, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Legislation\") was enacted in the United States, significantly revising certain U.S. corporate income tax provisions; including, among other items, a reduction of the U.S. corporate rate from 35% to 21%, effective for tax year beginning after December 31, 2017; the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system; and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, (or, if greater, November 2, 2017) of a specified foreign corporation\u201d which includes controlled foreign corporations and other foreign corporations which have at least one U.S. corporate shareholder that owns 10% or more of the value or voting power of such foreign corporation. We estimated the impact of the Tax Legislation on our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Legislation and guidance available at the date of this filing and as a result have recorded adjustments to the various tax balances, current, long-term and deferred tax assets and liabilities, all during the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the Tax Legislation was enacted. The actual amounts recorded in 2017 were not significantly different from the provisional amounts estimated in the prior year tax provision.\nManagement periodically evaluates all evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets is still needed. For each of the three years ended December 31, 2018, we concluded, based on the projections of taxable income, that certain of our corporate subsidiaries more likely than not will realize a partial benefit from their deferred tax assets and loss carry forwards. Ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon, among other factors, our corporate subsidiaries' ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods and is subject to change depending on the tax laws in effect in the years in which the carryforwards are used.\nSee Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our income taxes.\nValuation of Investments\nThe fair value of our investments, including securities sold, not yet purchased, is based on observable market prices when available. Securities owned by the Investment Funds that are listed on a securities exchange are valued at their last sales price on the primary securities exchange on which such securities are traded on such date. Securities that are not listed on any exchange but are traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the last bid\u201d and ask\u201d price for such security on such date. Securities and other instruments for which market quotes are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the applicable general partner. For some investments little market activity may exist; management's\ndetermination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment.\nLong-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWe calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various definite-lived assets. When assets are placed in service, we make estimates of what we believe are their reasonable useful lives.\nLong-lived assets held and used by our various operating segments and long-lived assets to be disposed of are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as vacancies and rejected leases and reduced production capacity, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Definite-lived assets held by our various segments are periodically reviewed for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required analysis and an impairment loss is recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, held by our various segments are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment is necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss, equal to the difference (limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the tested reporting unit), is recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated goodwill was $247 million, primarily within our Automotive segment. We perform the annual goodwill impairment test for our Automotive segment as of October 1 of each year. Based on our annual goodwill impairment analysis for our Automotive segment, we determined that the carrying value of its Parts reporting unit exceeded its fair value and as a result, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to the Parts reporting unit. We also determined that the fair value of our Automotive segment's Service reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value and therefore, no impairment is required. As of December 31, 2018, our Automotive segment had remaining goodwill of $241 million, which is allocated entirely to its Service reporting unit.\nWe base the fair value of our reporting units on consideration of various valuation methodologies, including projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved (\"DCF\"). Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital of a market participant.
