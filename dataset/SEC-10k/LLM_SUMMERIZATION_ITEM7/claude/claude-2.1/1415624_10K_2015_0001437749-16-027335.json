In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nYuMe is a leading independent provider of multi-screen video advertising technology, connecting brand advertisers, digital media property owners and consumers of video content across a growing range of Internet-connected devices. YuMe offers advertising customers end-to-end marketing solutions by combining data-driven technologies with deep insight into audience behavior. In 2015 we introduced our DSP platform, called YuMe for Advertisers, to find relevant audiences and deliver targeted advertising and our SSP platform, called YFP 5.0, which helps aggregate audiences, define audience characteristics and offer monetization opportunities for digital media property owners. Because we provide solutions for both buyers and sellers of digital video advertising we operate an end-to-end\u201d or full-stack\u201d programmatic platform.\nOur digital video advertising solutions are purpose-built for brand advertisers, advertising agencies and digital media property owners. Through a sophisticated platform of proprietary embedded software, data science, machine-learning algorithms, and programmatic tools we deliver TV-scale video advertising campaigns to relevant, brand-receptive digital audiences. We aggregate these audiences across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, which include personal computers, smartphones, tablets, set-top boxes, game consoles and Internet-connected TVs, by providing global digital media property owners with proprietary software that monetizes their professionally produced content and applications with our advertising campaigns. Our industry leadership is reflected in our wide audience reach, large customer base and scale in data derived from our large embedded software base.\nFor our advertising customers, we overcome the complexities of delivering digital video brand advertising campaigns in a highly fragmented environment where audiences use an increasing variety of Internet-connected devices to access thousands of online and mobile websites and applications. Our solutions deliver brand-optimized video advertising campaigns seamlessly across Internet-connected devices. Our platform optimizes advertising campaign results that are relevant to brand advertisers, such as brand awareness, message recall, brand favorability, and purchase intent. Because of this, we believe brand advertisers and brand-focused agencies can find particular benefit in our private marketplace programmatic offering where brand advertisers are able to programmatically manage the audiences and digital media properties where their campaigns will run.\nFor global digital media property owners that supply advertising inventory, we offer a platform which enables us to make their inventory available to advertising customers and deliver digital video ads to the audiences of digital media property owners that are optimized for specific advertising customer needs. In order to categorize these audiences and provide a scalable, programmatic cross-platform monetization solution to digital media property owners, our platform gathers first party data through our cross-device SDK and incorporates third party data from partners. We then apply our data science capabilities to aggregate audiences that will be relevant to brand advertisers. In combination, these capabilities allow us to deliver ads to audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages, which drives better monetization for digital media property owners.\nThe core of our business relies on our sophisticated platform that encompasses customized embedded software, programmatic advertising management (buying and selling tools) and data science capabilities. Our YuMe SDKs are embedded by our digital media property owners and collect data that we use for our advanced audience modeling algorithms, continuously improving our ability to optimize advertising campaigns around results that are relevant to brand advertisers. Our PQI inventory scoring system leverages YuMe SDKs and other data sources to assess through algorithms the quality of ad placements and optimize placements for maximum brand advertising results. Our Audience Amplifier machine-learning tool uses data gathered by YuMe SDKs in its correlative data models to find audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages.\nOver our eleven-year operating history we have amassed a vast amount of data derived from our large installed base of YuMe SDKs that are embedded in online and mobile websites and entertainment applications residing on millions of Internet-connected devices. This allows us to deliver TV-like ads, enhanced and customized for each specific device type, and collect valuable advertisement viewership data. We collect billions of data points each year from ad impressions we deliver. As we grow our audience and advertiser footprint, we are able to collect even more data, which in turn enables us to improve the efficacy of our targeting models, further improving the utility of our solutions and driving increased adoption of our technology.\nWe generate revenue by delivering digital video ads on Internet-connected devices. Our ads run when users choose to view video content on their devices. Advertising campaigns occur when customers submit orders to us and we fulfill those orders by delivering their digital video ads to audiences available through digital media properties, a process that we refer to as an advertising campaign. Advertising customers typically pay us on a CPM basis, of which we generally pay digital media property owners a negotiated percentage. Our customers primarily consist of large global brands and their advertising agencies. In 2015, we had 1,001 customers, including 77 of the top 100 U.S. advertisers as ranked by Advertising Age magazine in 2014 ( the AdAge 100\u201d), such as American Express, AT&T, GlaxoSmithKline, Home Depot and McDonald's.\nIn July 2013, our board of directors and stockholders approved an amendment to our then current amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The amendment provided for a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the outstanding common stock, effective July 24, 2013. Accordingly, (i) every six shares of common stock were combined into one share of common stock, (ii) the number of shares of common stock into which each outstanding option or warrant to purchase common stock is exercisable, as the case may be, have been proportionately decreased on a 1-for-6 basis, (iii) the exercise price for each such outstanding option or warrant to purchase common stock has been proportionately increased on a 6-for-1 basis, and (iv) the conversion ratio for each share of preferred stock outstanding was proportionately reduced on a 1-for-6 basis. All of the share numbers, share prices, and exercise prices have been adjusted within our consolidated financial statements, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 1-for-6 reverse stock split. We paid cash in lieu of any fractional shares to which a holder of common stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the reverse stock split.\nOn August 12, 2013, we closed the IPO of our common stock. In the IPO, we sold 5,125,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.00 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 21,840,537 shares of common stock and all outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock converted into warrants to purchase 53,983 shares of our common stock.\nAcquisition Activity\nIn December 2012, we acquired Crowd Science, Inc., a U.S.-based audience targeting technology company, for approximately $1.1 million in cash and 2,000,000 shares of our Series D-1 preferred stock. We held back $49,000 in cash and 400,000 shares of our Series D-1 convertible preferred stock until the second anniversary of the closing date, for general representations and subject to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The performance conditions were not met in 2013. As such, we permanently withheld the contingent consideration. Our 1-for-6 reverse stock split in July 2013 and the conversion of preferred stock to common stock associated with our IPO in August 2013 resulted in the number of shares permanently held back by the Company to become 66,666 common stock shares. We account for the withheld shares as 66,666 shares of treasury stock.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

impressions delivered on digital media properties. A substantial majority of our contracts with customers take the form of ad insertion orders placed by advertising agencies on behalf of their brand advertiser clients, which are typically one to three months in duration. Occasionally, we enter into longer term contracts with customers.\nWe count direct advertising customers in accordance with the following principles: (i) we count each advertiser, not the advertising agencies through which its ad insertion orders may be placed, as the customer; and (ii) entities that are part of the same corporate structure are counted as a single customer. We also generate other revenue from digital media property owners, including platform fees, professional service fees and ad serving fees, and other revenue from intermediaries that have relationships with advertising agencies and advertisers. In calculating revenue per direct advertising customer, we exclude this other revenue.\nOur revenue tends to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry. For example, many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday and year-end purchasing activities. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects the highest advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>173,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,525 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>151,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 2.5%, compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by certain brand advertisers spending less on our platform due to the effects of prior operational issues and our currently immaterial participation in the programmatic channel. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during 2015 compared to the British pound and euro contributed to the decrease in revenue. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2015 was $171,000, a decrease of 13.6%, compared to $198,000 for 2014. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. We had 1,001 advertising customers in 2015, an increase of 13.8%, compared to 880 in 2014. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2015 accounted for $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our revenue, compared to $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue for 2014.\nFor 2014, revenue increased $26.7 million, or 17.6%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $26.5 million in net advertising sales. The increase in net advertising sales was primarily driven by an increase in the number of advertising customers, including those located in international markets. We had 880 advertising customers in 2014, an increase of 51.7%, compared to 580 in 2013. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2014 was $198,000, a decrease of 22.4%, compared to $255,000 for 2013. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new international customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2014 accounted for $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue, compared to $61.9 million, or 41.0%, of our revenue for 2013.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred with digital media property owners, typically under revenue-sharing arrangements. We refer to these costs as traffic acquisition costs. Generally, we incur traffic acquisition costs in the period the advertising impressions are delivered. In limited circumstances, we incur costs based on minimum guaranteed impressions. Cost of revenue also includes ad delivery costs such as labor and related costs, depreciation and amortization related to acquired technologies, internally developed software and data center assets, and Internet access costs. These expenses are classified as cost of revenue in the corresponding period in which the revenue is recognized. We expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to increase in absolute dollars in 2016, but to remain constant as a percentage of revenue. We expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to increase in absolute dollars, but to remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,457 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit percentage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, cost of revenue increased $1.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $6.1 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs, which was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in other costs of revenues. For 2015, cost of revenue, as a percentage of revenue, increased 2.4% to 54.8% from 52.4% for 2014, primarily as a result of higher traffic acquisition costs.\nFor 2014, cost of revenue increased $12.9 million, or 16.0%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $11.5 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs as a result of the increase in revenue, and a $1.4 million increase in other costs of revenues. For 2014, cost of revenue, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 0.7% to 52.4% from 53.1% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in revenue and the benefit of certain economies of scale.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell to our customers primarily through our direct sales force personnel, who have established relationships with major advertising agencies and direct relationships with advertisers. Our sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment expenses, and incentive compensation for our sales and marketing employees. Sales and marketing expenses also include promotional, advertising and public relations costs, as well as depreciation, facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,200 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,118 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.2 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2015, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased by 2.0% to 34.6% from 36.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of the decrease in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nFor 2014, sales and marketing expenses increased $18.0 million, or 38.2%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $16.1 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees in our sales and marketing organization as it expanded, both domestically and internationally. Other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, increased $1.9 million. For 2014, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 5.4% to 36.6% from 31.2% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in research and development efforts to create and enhance our existing, data-science capabilities and proprietary technologies. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our engineers, product development and information technology personnel. Research and development expenses also include outside services and consulting, depreciation, facilities and other overhead costs. We capitalize a portion of our research and development costs attributable to internally developed software.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had 148, 91 and 89 research and development employees, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, 116 research and development employees were located in our Chennai and Pune, India offices. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in the research and development of our products, and to increase as a percentage of revenue in the short term. We believe that our eleven-year operating history and our ability to attract and retain the large pool of engineering talent available in India will help us expand our engineering resources and capabilities cost-effectively.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,499 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, research and development expenses increased $5.0 million, or 85.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to an increase of $3.6 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our research and development organization as it expanded, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, other departmental expenses, including equipment support and maintenance and depreciation, including depreciation expense related to capitalized internally developed software, increased $1.4 million. For 2015, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 3.0% to 6.3% from 3.3% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nFor 2014, research and development expenses increased $1.4 million, or 31.3%, compared to 2013. The increase was attributable to an increase of $0.7 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our research and development organization as it expanded, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, amortization and depreciation expense increased $0.7 million primarily related to purchases of computer equipment and software. For 2014, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 0.3% to 3.3% from 3.0% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. General and administrative expenses also include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our financial, accounting, human resources, information systems and legal personnel and resources to support our public reporting requirements, and to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,992 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, general and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.5 million in professional service fees and consulting services as we placed greater reliance on internal employee labor rather than external consultants. For 2015, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 1.4% to 13.6% from 12.2% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in general and administrative employees and the associated increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nFor 2014, general and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million, or 20.8%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.3 million increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Additionally, other departmental expenses, including voice and data communications and insurance expenses, increased $2.3 million associated with the increase in the number of employees and additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Partially offsetting this increase were decreases of $0.6 million in professional service fees and $1.2 million in consulting services primarily related to our initial public offering in August 2013. For 2014, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 0.3% to 12.2% from 11.9% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in general and administrative employees and the associated increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense on our capital lease obligations, accretion and amortization on marketable securities, gains and losses on our derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains and losses., and prior to our IPO in August 2013, the revaluation of our outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction loss on foreign exchange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(544 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,027 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(907 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(120 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of warrants liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on derivative instruments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization and accretion of marketable securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(420 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(503 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(454 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-operating income (loss), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(238 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(896 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(610 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(286 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, interest and other expense, net decreased by $0.7 million, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.1 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2015. Our investments in derivative instruments are intended to mitigate a portion of our foreign transaction exchange gains and losses reported as income or expense on our statements of operations. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.1 million.\nFor 2014, interest and other income (expense), net increased by $0.6 million, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Euro and British pound sterling during 2014. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases in other expense was an increase in interest income on our marketable securities of $0.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013. We began investing our cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities during the fourth quarter of 2013.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and the realization of net operating loss carryforwards.\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(300 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(524 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(670 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, income tax expense was primarily related to the federal alternative minimum tax, state taxes and taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nFor 2014, income tax benefit was primarily related to the full-year net loss before income taxes of $9.0 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude expenses for: interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management and the board of directors. This non-GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP information of other companies. Non-GAAP information should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made. The following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods indicated below:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,745 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,745 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(224 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,654 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,552 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,975 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by us and the board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other GAAP results.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our unaudited quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following tables present unaudited quarterly results for 2015 and 2014. These tables include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider for the fair statement of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonality has caused, and is likely to continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nSelected summarized quarterly financial information for 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,859 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,534 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,835 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,996 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per share (a):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.18 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.18 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,292 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,108 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,028 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,560 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,069 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per share (a):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.09 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.08 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.16 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.09 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.08 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.16 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented.

As of December 31, 2015, we had $60.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2015 are comprised of money market funds and corporate bonds. Cash held internationally as of December 31, 2015 totaled $7.4 million.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through private sales of convertible preferred stock. On August 12, 2013, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 5,125,000 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all of our convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into 21,840,537 shares of common stock, based on the shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding as of August 12, 2013. In addition, all outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock automatically converted into warrants to purchase 53,983 shares of common stock, and the preferred stock warrant liability of $0.4 million as of August 12, 2013 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\nIn November 2014, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d) to borrow up to a maximum of $25.0 million collateralized by our cash deposits, accounts receivable and equipment, as well as certain other assets. The Loan and Security Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and reporting covenants, including maintaining an adjusted quick ratio of 1.6 to 1.0. Annual fees under the agreement total one quarter of 1.0% of the average unused balance of the credit line per annum. As of December 31, 2015, YuMe had no borrowings outstanding under this credit line.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the cost of maintaining and improving our technologies, and our operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our solutions. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to obtain needed additional funds, we will have to reduce our operating expenses, which would impair our growth prospects and could otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,130 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>463 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,108 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,509 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,232 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities is receipts from the sale of our advertising solutions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are payments to publishers and other vendors for the purchase of digital media inventory and related costs, employee compensation and related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general operating expenses, and the purchase of property and equipment.\nWe used $1.1 million of cash in operating activities during 2015, primarily resulting from a net loss of $(16.7) million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Depreciation and amortization of $6.0 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Stock-based compensation of $8.9 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Bad debt expense of $1.0 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Amortization of premiums on marketable securities, net of $0.4 million;

In our IPO, which closed on August 12, 2013, we issued and sold 5,125,000 shares of common stock at a price of $9.00 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million.\nWe generated $2.1 million of cash from financing activities during 2015 from the exercise of common stock options.\nWe generated $4.2 million of cash from financing activities during 2014. We received $4.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by $0.3 million of repayments of borrowings under notes payable and capital leases.\nWe generated $39.4 million of cash from financing activities during 2013. We received $40.0 million of net cash proceeds in connection with our IPO and $0.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by $0.8 million of repayments of borrowings under notes payable and capital leases.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, solutions to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California, under operating lease agreements that expire through September 2027. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. Rent expense under operating leases totaled $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe also enter into agreements with digital media property owners that require the purchase of a minimum number of impressions on a monthly or quarterly basis. Our purchase commitments expire on various dates through December 2016.\nOur future minimum payments under these arrangements as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Traffic acquisition costs and other purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total minimum payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We have determined our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 will not result in any additional taxes payable by us. As a result, no amounts are shown in the table above relating to uncertain tax positions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, internal-use software development costs, business combinations, income taxes and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is principally derived from advertising services measured by the number of advertising impressions displayed on digital media properties owned and controlled by third party digital media property owners and priced on a CPM basis. We recognize revenue when: (1) persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been provided; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. For all revenue transactions, we consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Our arrangements generally do not include a provision for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact revenue recognition. Arrangements for these services generally have a term of up to three months and in some cases the term may be up to one year.\nIn the normal course of business, we act as a facilitator in executing transactions with third parties. The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether we act as the principal or an agent, we follow the accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. While none of the factors identified in this guidance is individually considered presumptive or determinative, because we are the primary obligor and are responsible for (i) identifying and contracting with third party advertisers, (ii) establishing the selling prices of the advertisements sold, (iii) performing all billing and collection activities including retaining credit risk and (iv) bearing sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising, we act as the principal in these arrangements and therefore reports revenue earned and costs incurred on a gross basis.\nWe generally recognize revenue based on delivery information from a combination of third party reporting and our proprietary campaign tracking systems. Revenue is attributed to the U.S. and individual foreign countries based on the domicile of the salesperson that facilitated the revenue generating transaction.\nMultiple-element Arrangements\nWe enter into arrangements with customers to sell advertising packages that include different media placements or ad services that are delivered at the same time, or within close proximity of one another.\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to all deliverables, based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available; (2) third party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE is not available; and (3) best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nVSOE-We evaluate VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the standalone selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We historically have not entered into a large volume of single element arrangements, so we have not been able to establish VSOE for any of our advertising products.\nTPE-When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services' selling prices are on a standalone basis. As a result, we have not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\nBESP-When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a standalone basis. BESP is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in our multiple element arrangements. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, class of advertiser, size of transaction, seasonality, observed pricing trends, available online inventory, industry pricing strategies, market conditions and competitive landscape. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables. We will regularly review BESP. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe recognize the relative fair value of the media placements or ad services as they are delivered assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nDeferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition\nInternal-use Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs related to software developed for internal use. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in product development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional features or functionality are capitalized and expensed over the estimated useful life of the enhancements, generally three years.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire a business, we determine the acquisition purchase price as the sum of the consideration we provide. When we issue stock-based awards to an acquired company's selling stockholders, we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-business combination services. Our evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the stock-based awards is contingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as future compensation expense over the required service period.\nWe allocate the purchase price in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. To date, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business combinations have primarily consisted of acquired working capital and definite-lived intangible assets. The carrying value of acquired working capital is assumed to be equal to its fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We maintain a full valuation allowance to offset domestic net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets. Our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 was attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from U.S. net operating losses, foreign timing differences and other deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $23.5 million, expiring beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $20.5 million, expiring beginning in 2016. As of December 31, 2015 we had federal research and development tax credits of approximately $1.0 million, expiring beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2015, we had state research and development tax credits of approximately $0.9 million, and other tax credits of $0.3 million, both of which carry forward indefinitely.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relative tax law, and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) a determination is made as to whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option valuation model is affected by our common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, we may adopt the standard in either its first quarter of 2018 or 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP but retains the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently and expands the guidance to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply ASU 2015-01 prospectively. A reporting entity may also apply ASU 2015-01 retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. We believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to adopt this update prospectively as of December 31, 2015. Prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments--Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). This standard requires entities that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The standard is effective for fiscal years and the interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included later in this Form 10-K.

YuMe offers advertising customers end-to-end marketing solutions by combining data-driven technologies with deep insight into audience behavior. In 2015 we introduced our DSP platform, called YuMe for Advertisers, to find relevant audiences and deliver targeted advertising and our SSP platform, called YFP 5.0, which helps aggregate audiences, define audience characteristics and offer monetization opportunities for digital media property owners. Because we provide solutions for both buyers and sellers of digital video advertising we operate an end-to-end\u201d or full-stack\u201d programmatic platform.\nOur digital video advertising solutions are purpose-built for brand advertisers, advertising agencies and digital media property owners. Through a sophisticated platform of proprietary embedded software, data science, machine-learning algorithms, and programmatic tools we deliver TV-scale video advertising campaigns to relevant, brand-receptive digital audiences. We aggregate these audiences across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, which include personal computers, smartphones, tablets, set-top boxes, game consoles and Internet-connected TVs, by providing global digital media property owners with proprietary software that monetizes their professionally produced content and applications with our advertising campaigns. Our industry leadership is reflected in our wide audience reach, large customer base and scale in data derived from our large embedded software base.\nFor our advertising customers, we overcome the complexities of delivering digital video brand advertising campaigns in a highly fragmented environment where audiences use an increasing variety of Internet-connected devices to access thousands of online and mobile websites and applications. Our solutions deliver brand-optimized video advertising campaigns seamlessly across Internet-connected devices. Our platform optimizes advertising campaign results that are relevant to brand advertisers, such as brand awareness, message recall, brand favorability, and purchase intent. Because of this, we believe brand advertisers and brand-focused agencies can find particular benefit in our private marketplace programmatic offering where brand advertisers are able to programmatically manage the audiences and digital media properties where their campaigns will run.\nFor global digital media property owners that supply advertising inventory, we offer a platform which enables us to make their inventory available to advertising customers and deliver digital video ads to the audiences of digital media property owners that are optimized for specific advertising customer needs. In order to categorize these audiences and provide a scalable, programmatic cross-platform monetization solution to digital media property owners, our platform gathers first party data through our cross-device SDK and incorporates third party data from partners. We then apply our data science capabilities to aggregate audiences that will be relevant to brand advertisers. In combination, these capabilities allow us to deliver ads to audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages, which drives better monetization for digital media property owners.\nThe core of our business relies on our sophisticated platform that encompasses customized embedded software, programmatic advertising management (buying and selling tools) and data science capabilities. Our YuMe SDKs are embedded by our digital media property owners and collect data that we use for our advanced audience modeling algorithms, continuously improving our ability to optimize advertising campaigns around results that are relevant to brand advertisers. Our PQI inventory scoring system leverages YuMe SDKs and other data sources to assess through algorithms the quality of ad placements and optimize placements for maximum brand advertising results. Our Audience Amplifier machine-learning tool uses data gathered by YuMe SDKs in its correlative data models to find audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages.\nOver our eleven-year operating history we have amassed a vast amount of data derived from our large installed base of YuMe SDKs that are embedded in online and mobile websites and entertainment applications residing on millions of Internet-connected devices. This allows us to deliver TV-like ads, enhanced and customized for each specific device type, and collect valuable advertisement viewership data. We collect billions of data points each year from ad impressions we deliver. As we grow our audience and advertiser footprint, we are able to collect even more data, which in turn enables us to improve the efficacy of our targeting models, further improving the utility of our solutions and driving increased adoption of our technology.\nWe generate revenue by delivering digital video ads on Internet-connected devices. Our ads run when users choose to view video content on their devices. Advertising campaigns occur when customers submit orders to us and we fulfill those orders by delivering their digital video ads to audiences available through digital media properties, a process that we refer to as an advertising campaign. Advertising customers typically pay us on a CPM basis, of which we generally pay digital media property owners a negotiated percentage. Our customers primarily consist of large global brands and their advertising agencies. In 2015, we had 1,001 customers, including 77 of the top 100 U.S. advertisers as ranked by Advertising Age magazine in 2014 ( the AdAge 100\u201d), such as American Express, AT&T, GlaxoSmithKline, Home Depot and McDonald's.\nIn July 2013, our board of directors and stockholders approved an amendment to our then current amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The amendment provided for a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the outstanding common stock, effective July 24, 2013. Accordingly, (i) every six shares of common stock were combined into one share of common stock, (ii) the number of shares of common stock into which each outstanding option or warrant to purchase common stock is exercisable, as the case may be, have been proportionately decreased on a 1-for-6 basis, (iii) the exercise price for each such outstanding option or warrant to purchase common stock has been proportionately increased on a 6-for-1 basis, and (iv) the conversion ratio for each share of preferred stock outstanding was proportionately reduced on a 1-for-6 basis. All of the share numbers, share prices, and exercise prices have been adjusted within our consolidated financial statements, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 1-for-6 reverse stock split. We paid cash in lieu of any fractional shares to which a holder of common stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the reverse stock split.\nOn August 12, 2013, we closed the IPO of our common stock. In the IPO, we sold 5,125,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.00 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 21,840,537 shares of common stock and all outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock converted into warrants to purchase 53,983 shares of our common stock.\nAcquisition Activity\nIn December 2012, we acquired Crowd Science, Inc., a U.S.-based audience targeting technology company, for approximately $1.1 million in cash and 2,000,000 shares of our Series D-1 preferred stock. We held back $49,000 in cash and 400,000 shares of our Series D-1 convertible preferred stock until the second anniversary of the closing date, for general representations and subject to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The performance conditions were not met in 2013. As such, we permanently withheld the contingent consideration. Our 1-for-6 reverse stock split in July 2013 and the conversion of preferred stock to common stock associated with our IPO in August 2013 resulted in the number of shares permanently held back by the Company to become 66,666 common stock shares. We account for the withheld shares as 66,666 shares of treasury stock.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

and measured by the number of advertising impressions delivered on digital media properties. A substantial majority of our contracts with customers take the form of ad insertion orders placed by advertising agencies on behalf of their brand advertiser clients, which are typically one to three months in duration. Occasionally, we enter into longer term contracts with customers.\nWe count direct advertising customers in accordance with the following principles: (i) we count each advertiser, not the advertising agencies through which its ad insertion orders may be placed, as the customer; and (ii) entities that are part of the same corporate structure are counted as a single customer. We also generate other revenue from digital media property owners, including platform fees, professional service fees and ad serving fees, and other revenue from intermediaries that have relationships with advertising agencies and advertisers. In calculating revenue per direct advertising customer, we exclude this other revenue.\nOur revenue tends to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry. For example, many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday and year-end purchasing activities. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects the highest advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>173,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,525 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>151,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 2.5%, compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by certain brand advertisers spending less on our platform due to the effects of prior operational issues and our currently immaterial participation in the programmatic channel. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during 2015 compared to the British pound and euro contributed to the decrease in revenue. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2015 was $171,000, a decrease of 13.6%, compared to $198,000 for 2014. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. We had 1,001 advertising customers in 2015, an increase of 13.8%, compared to 880 in 2014. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2015 accounted for $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our revenue, compared to $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue for 2014.\nFor 2014, revenue increased $26.7 million, or 17.6%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $26.5 million in net advertising sales. The increase in net advertising sales was primarily driven by an increase in the number of advertising customers, including those located in international markets. We had 880 advertising customers in 2014, an increase of 51.7%, compared to 580 in 2013. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2014 was $198,000, a decrease of 22.4%, compared to $255,000 for 2013. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new international customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2014 accounted for $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue, compared to $61.9 million, or 41.0%, of our revenue for 2013.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred with digital media property owners, typically under revenue-sharing arrangements. We refer to these costs as traffic acquisition costs. Generally, we incur traffic acquisition costs in the period the advertising impressions are delivered. In limited circumstances, we incur costs based on minimum guaranteed impressions. Cost of revenue also includes ad delivery costs such as labor and related costs, depreciation and amortization related to acquired technologies, internally developed software and data center assets, and Internet access costs. These expenses are classified as cost of revenue in the corresponding period in which the revenue is recognized. We expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to increase in absolute dollars in 2016, but to remain constant as a percentage of revenue. We expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to increase in absolute dollars, but to remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,457 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit percentage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, cost of revenue increased $1.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $6.1 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs, which was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in other costs of revenues. For 2015, cost of revenue, as a percentage of revenue, increased 2.4% to 54.8% from 52.4% for 2014, primarily as a result of higher traffic acquisition costs.\nFor 2014, cost of revenue increased $12.9 million, or 16.0%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $11.5 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs as a result of the increase in revenue, and a $1.4 million increase in other costs of revenues. For 2014, cost of revenue, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 0.7% to 52.4% from 53.1% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in revenue and the benefit of certain economies of scale.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell to our customers primarily through our direct sales force personnel, who have established relationships with major advertising agencies and direct relationships with advertisers. Our sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment expenses, and incentive compensation for our sales and marketing employees. Sales and marketing expenses also include promotional, advertising and public relations costs, as well as depreciation, facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,200 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,118 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.2 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2015, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased by 2.0% to 34.6% from 36.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of the decrease in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nFor 2014, sales and marketing expenses increased $18.0 million, or 38.2%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $16.1 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees in our sales and marketing organization as it expanded, both domestically and internationally. Other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, increased $1.9 million. For 2014, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 5.4% to 36.6% from 31.2% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in research and development efforts to create and enhance our existing, data-science capabilities and proprietary technologies. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our engineers, product development and information technology personnel. Research and development expenses also include outside services and consulting, depreciation, facilities and other overhead costs. We capitalize a portion of our research and development costs attributable to internally developed software.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had 148, 91 and 89 research and development employees, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, 116 research and development employees were located in our Chennai and Pune, India offices. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in the research and development of our products, and to increase as a percentage of revenue in the short term. We believe that our eleven-year operating history and our ability to attract and retain the large pool of engineering talent available in India will help us expand our engineering resources and capabilities cost-effectively.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,499 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, research and development expenses increased $5.0 million, or 85.1%, compared to 2014.

Additionally, other departmental expenses, including equipment support and maintenance and depreciation, including depreciation expense related to capitalized internally developed software, increased $1.4 million. For 2015, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 3.0% to 6.3% from 3.3% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nFor 2014, research and development expenses increased $1.4 million, or 31.3%, compared to 2013. The increase was attributable to an increase of $0.7 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our research and development organization as it expanded, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, amortization and depreciation expense increased $0.7 million primarily related to purchases of computer equipment and software. For 2014, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 0.3% to 3.3% from 3.0% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. General and administrative expenses also include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our financial, accounting, human resources, information systems and legal personnel and resources to support our public reporting requirements, and to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,992 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, general and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.5 million in professional service fees and consulting services as we placed greater reliance on internal employee labor rather than external consultants. For 2015, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 1.4% to 13.6% from 12.2% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in general and administrative employees and the associated increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nFor 2014, general and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million, or 20.8%, compared to 2013.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.1 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2015. Our investments in derivative instruments are intended to mitigate a portion of our foreign transaction exchange gains and losses reported as income or expense on our statements of operations. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.1 million.\nFor 2014, interest and other income (expense), net increased by $0.6 million, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Euro and British pound sterling during 2014. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases in other expense was an increase in interest income on our marketable securities of $0.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013. We began investing our cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities during the fourth quarter of 2013.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and the realization of net operating loss carryforwards.\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(300 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(524 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(670 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015, income tax expense was primarily related to the federal alternative minimum tax, state taxes and taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nFor 2014, income tax benefit was primarily related to the full-year net loss before income taxes of $9.0 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude expenses for: interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management and the board of directors. This non-GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP information of other companies. Non-GAAP information should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made. The following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods indicated below:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,745 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,745 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(224 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,654 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,552 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,975 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by us and the board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other GAAP results.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our unaudited quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following tables present unaudited quarterly results for 2015 and 2014. These tables include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider for the fair statement of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonality has caused, and is likely to continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nSelected summarized quarterly financial information for 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,859 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,534 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,835 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,996 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per share (a):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.18 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.18 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,292 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,108 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,028 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,560 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,069 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per share (a):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.09 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.08 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.16 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.09 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.08 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.16 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2015, we had $60.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2015 are comprised of money market funds and corporate bonds. Cash held internationally as of December 31, 2015 totaled $7.4 million.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through private sales of convertible preferred stock. On August 12, 2013, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 5,125,000 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all of our convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into 21,840,537 shares of common stock, based on the shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding as of August 12, 2013. In addition, all outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock automatically converted into warrants to purchase 53,983 shares of common stock, and the preferred stock warrant liability of $0.4 million as of August 12, 2013 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\nIn November 2014, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d) to borrow up to a maximum of $25.0 million collateralized by our cash deposits, accounts receivable and equipment, as well as certain other assets. The Loan and Security Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and reporting covenants, including maintaining an adjusted quick ratio of 1.6 to 1.0. Annual fees under the agreement total one quarter of 1.0% of the average unused balance of the credit line per annum. As of December 31, 2015, YuMe had no borrowings outstanding under this credit line.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the cost of maintaining and improving our technologies, and our operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our solutions. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to obtain needed additional funds, we will have to reduce our operating expenses, which would impair our growth prospects and could otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,130 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>463 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,108 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,509 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,232 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities is receipts from the sale of our advertising solutions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are payments to publishers and other vendors for the purchase of digital media inventory and related costs, employee compensation and related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general operating expenses, and the purchase of property and equipment.\nWe used $1.1 million of cash in operating activities during 2015, primarily resulting from a net loss of $(16.7) million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization of $6.0 million; \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation of $8.9 million; \n \u2022 Bad debt expense of $1.0 million; \n \u2022 Amortization of premiums on marketable securities, net of $0.4 million; and \n \u2022 Deferred income taxes of $(0.3) million. \nIn addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in significant cash increases (decreases) as follows:\n \u2022 $(0.4) million from a net decrease in accounts payable, accrued digital media property owner costs and other accrued liabilities as a result of the timing of payments to our vendors; \n \u2022 $0.3 million from a decrease in accounts receivable due to a decrease in billings for advertising campaigns as well as timing of payments from these advertising customers; and \n \u2022 $(0.3) million from an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the timing of payments for rent, insurance and other operating costs. \nWe generated $6.8 million of cash from operating activities during 2014, primarily resulting from a net loss of $(8.7) million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization of $4.6 million; \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation of $5.8 million; \n \u2022 Bad debt expense of $1.2 million; \n \u2022 Amortization of premiums on marketable securities, net of $0.5 million; and \n \u2022 Deferred income taxes of $(0.3) million. \nIn addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in significant cash increases (decreases) as follows:\n \u2022 $9.1 million from an increase in accounts payable, accrued digital media property owner costs and other accrued liabilities as a result of the growth of our business and the timing of payments to our vendors; \n \u2022 $(4.1) million from an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in billings for advertising campaigns, especially during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, as well as timing of payments from these advertising customers; and \n \u2022 $(1.1) million from an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the timing of payments for rent, insurance and other operating costs. \nWe generated $0.5 million of cash from operating activities during 2013, primarily resulting from net income of $0.3 million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million; \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation of $3.8 million; \n \u2022 Bad debt expense of $0.5 million; and \n \u2022 Deferred income taxes of $(0.2) million. \nIn addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in significant cash increases (decreases) as follows:\n \u2022 $11.0 million from an increase in accounts payable, accrued digital media property owner costs and other accrued liabilities as a result of the growth of our business and the timing of payments to our vendors; \n \u2022 $(17.9) million from an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in billings for advertising campaigns, especially during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013, as well as timing of payments from these advertising customers; and \n \u2022 $(1.2) million from an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the timing of payments for rent, insurance and other operating costs. \nInvesting Activities\nPrior to 2013, our primary investing activities have consisted of (i) purchases of property and equipment to support the build out of our data centers and software to support website development and operations, and our corporate infrastructure, and (ii) acquisitions. Purchases of property and equipment may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations and website and internal-use software and development. During 2013, we purchased marketable securities using cash proceeds we received from our IPO in August 2013.\nWe used $21.1 million of cash for investing activities during 2015, primarily as follows:\n \u2022 $14.2 million to purchase short- and long-term marketable securities, net of maturities; \n \u2022 $2.8 million to purchase property, equipment and software; \n \u2022 $3.7 million to develop software for internal use; and \n \u2022 $0.4 million increase in restricted cash associated with a new building lease. \nWe used $15.5 million of cash for investing activities during 2014, primarily as follows:\n \u2022 $7.6 million to purchase short- and long-term marketable securities, net of maturities and sales; \n \u2022 $5.9 million to purchase property, equipment and software; and \n \u2022 $2.0 million to develop software for internal use. \nWe used $25.2 million of cash for investing activities during 2013, primarily as follows:\n \u2022 $21.5 million to purchase short- and long-term marketable securities; \n \u2022 $2.0 million to purchase property, equipment and software; and \n \u2022 $1.8 million to develop software for internal use. \nFinancing Activities\nPrior to our IPO, our financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, notes payable with a bank and the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options. In our IPO, which closed on August 12, 2013, we issued and sold 5,125,000 shares of common stock at a price of $9.00 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million.\nWe generated $2.1 million of cash from financing activities during 2015 from the exercise of common stock options.\nWe generated $4.2 million of cash from financing activities during 2014. We received $4.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by $0.3 million of repayments of borrowings under notes payable and capital leases.\nWe generated $39.4 million of cash from financing activities during 2013. We received $40.0 million of net cash proceeds in connection with our IPO and $0.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by $0.8 million of repayments of borrowings under notes payable and capital leases.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, solutions to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California, under operating lease agreements that expire through September 2027. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. Rent expense under operating leases totaled $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe also enter into agreements with digital media property owners that require the purchase of a minimum number of impressions on a monthly or quarterly basis. Our purchase commitments expire on various dates through December 2016.\nOur future minimum payments under these arrangements as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Traffic acquisition costs and other purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total minimum payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We have determined our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 will not result in any additional taxes payable by us. As a result, no amounts are shown in the table above relating to uncertain tax positions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, internal-use software development costs, business combinations, income taxes and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is principally derived from advertising services measured by the number of advertising impressions displayed on digital media properties owned and controlled by third party digital media property owners and priced on a CPM basis. We recognize revenue when: (1) persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been provided; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. For all revenue transactions, we consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Our arrangements generally do not include a provision for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact revenue recognition. Arrangements for these services generally have a term of up to three months and in some cases the term may be up to one year.\nIn the normal course of business, we act as a facilitator in executing transactions with third parties. The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether we act as the principal or an agent, we follow the accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. While none of the factors identified in this guidance is individually considered presumptive or determinative, because we are the primary obligor and are responsible for (i) identifying and contracting with third party advertisers, (ii) establishing the selling prices of the advertisements sold, (iii) performing all billing and collection activities including retaining credit risk and (iv) bearing sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising, we act as the principal in these arrangements and therefore reports revenue earned and costs incurred on a gross basis.\nWe generally recognize revenue based on delivery information from a combination of third party reporting and our proprietary campaign tracking systems. Revenue is attributed to the U.S. and individual foreign countries based on the domicile of the salesperson that facilitated the revenue generating transaction.\nMultiple-element Arrangements\nWe enter into arrangements with customers to sell advertising packages that include different media placements or ad services that are delivered at the same time, or within close proximity of one another.\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to all deliverables, based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available; (2) third party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE is not available; and (3) best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nVSOE-We evaluate VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the standalone selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We historically have not entered into a large volume of single element arrangements, so we have not been able to establish VSOE for any of our advertising products.\nTPE-When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services' selling prices are on a standalone basis. As a result, we have not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\nBESP-When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a standalone basis. BESP is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in our multiple element arrangements. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, class of advertiser, size of transaction, seasonality, observed pricing trends, available online inventory, industry pricing strategies, market conditions and competitive landscape. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables. We will regularly review BESP. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe recognize the relative fair value of the media placements or ad services as they are delivered assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nDeferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition\nInternal-use Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs related to software developed for internal use. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in product development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional features or functionality are capitalized and expensed over the estimated useful life of the enhancements, generally three years.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire a business, we determine the acquisition purchase price as the sum of the consideration we provide. When we issue stock-based awards to an acquired company's selling stockholders, we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-business combination services. Our evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the stock-based awards is contingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as future compensation expense over the required service period.\nWe allocate the purchase price in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. To date, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business combinations have primarily consisted of acquired working capital and definite-lived intangible assets. The carrying value of acquired working capital is assumed to be equal to its fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We maintain a full valuation allowance to offset domestic net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets. Our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 was attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from U.S. net operating losses, foreign timing differences and other deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $23.5 million, expiring beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $20.5 million, expiring beginning in 2016. As of December 31, 2015 we had federal research and development tax credits of approximately $1.0 million, expiring beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2015, we had state research and development tax credits of approximately $0.9 million, and other tax credits of $0.3 million, both of which carry forward indefinitely.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relative tax law, and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) a determination is made as to whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option valuation model is affected by our common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, we may adopt the standard in either its first quarter of 2018 or 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP but retains the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently and expands the guidance to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply ASU 2015-01 prospectively. A reporting entity may also apply ASU 2015-01 retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. We believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to adopt this update prospectively as of December 31, 2015. Prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments--Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). This standard requires entities that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The standard is effective for fiscal years and the interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included later in this Form 10-K.

YuMe offers advertising customers end-to-end marketing solutions by combining data-driven technologies with deep insight into audience behavior. In 2015 we introduced our DSP platform, called YuMe for Advertisers, to find relevant audiences and deliver targeted advertising and our SSP platform, called YFP 5.0, which helps aggregate audiences, define audience characteristics and offer monetization opportunities for digital media property owners. Because we provide solutions for both buyers and sellers of digital video advertising we operate an end-to-end\u201d or full-stack\u201d programmatic platform.\nOur digital video advertising solutions are purpose-built for brand advertisers, advertising agencies and digital media property owners. Through a sophisticated platform of proprietary embedded software, data science, machine-learning algorithms, and programmatic tools we deliver TV-scale video advertising campaigns to relevant, brand-receptive digital audiences. We aggregate these audiences across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, which include personal computers, smartphones, tablets, set-top boxes, game consoles and Internet-connected TVs, by providing global digital media property owners with proprietary software that monetizes their professionally produced content and applications with our advertising campaigns. Our industry leadership is reflected in our wide audience reach, large customer base and scale in data derived from our large embedded software base.\nFor our advertising customers, we overcome the complexities of delivering digital video brand advertising campaigns in a highly fragmented environment where audiences use an increasing variety of Internet-connected devices to access thousands of online and mobile websites and applications. Our solutions deliver brand-optimized video advertising campaigns seamlessly across Internet-connected devices. Our platform optimizes advertising campaign results that are relevant to brand advertisers, such as brand awareness, message recall, brand favorability, and purchase intent. Because of this, we believe brand advertisers and brand-focused agencies can find particular benefit in our private marketplace programmatic offering where brand advertisers are able to programmatically manage the audiences and digital media properties where their campaigns will run.\nFor global digital media property owners that supply advertising inventory, we offer a platform which enables us to make their inventory available to advertising customers and deliver digital video ads to the audiences of digital media property owners that are optimized for specific advertising customer needs. In order to categorize these audiences and provide a scalable, programmatic cross-platform monetization solution to digital media property owners, our platform gathers first party data through our cross-device SDK and incorporates third party data from partners. We then apply our data science capabilities to aggregate audiences that will be relevant to brand advertisers. In combination, these capabilities allow us to deliver ads to audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages, which drives better monetization for digital media property owners.\nThe core of our business relies on our sophisticated platform that encompasses customized embedded software, programmatic advertising management (buying and selling tools) and data science capabilities. Our YuMe SDKs are embedded by our digital media property owners and collect data that we use for our advanced audience modeling algorithms, continuously improving our ability to optimize advertising campaigns around results that are relevant to brand advertisers. Our PQI inventory scoring system leverages YuMe SDKs and other data sources to assess through algorithms the quality of ad placements and optimize placements for maximum brand advertising results. Our Audience Amplifier machine-learning tool uses data gathered by YuMe SDKs in its correlative data models to find audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages.\nOver our eleven-year operating history we have amassed a vast amount of data derived from our large installed base of YuMe SDKs that are embedded in online and mobile websites and entertainment applications residing on millions of Internet-connected devices. This allows us to deliver TV-like ads, enhanced and customized for each specific device type, and collect valuable advertisement viewership data. We collect billions of data points each year from ad impressions we deliver. As we grow our audience and advertiser footprint, we are able to collect even more data, which in turn enables us to improve the efficacy of our targeting models, further improving the utility of our solutions and driving increased adoption of our technology.\nWe generate revenue by delivering digital video ads on Internet-connected devices. Our ads run when users choose to view video content on their devices. Advertising campaigns occur when customers submit orders to us and we fulfill those orders by delivering their digital video ads to audiences available through digital media properties, a process that we refer to as an advertising campaign. Advertising customers typically pay us on a CPM basis, of which we generally pay digital media property owners a negotiated percentage. Our customers primarily consist of large global brands and their advertising agencies. In 2015, we had 1,001 customers, including 77 of the top 100 U.S. advertisers as ranked by Advertising Age magazine in 2014 ( the AdAge 100\u201d), such as American Express, AT&T, GlaxoSmithKline, Home Depot and McDonald's.\nIn July 2013, our board of directors and stockholders approved an amendment to our then current amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The amendment provided for a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the outstanding common stock, effective July 24, 2013. Accordingly, (i) every six shares of common stock were combined into one share of common stock, (ii) the number of shares of common stock into which each outstanding option or warrant to purchase common stock is exercisable, as the case may be, have been proportionately decreased on a 1-for-6 basis, (iii) the exercise price for each such outstanding option or warrant to purchase common stock has been proportionately increased on a 6-for-1 basis, and (iv) the conversion ratio for each share of preferred stock outstanding was proportionately reduced on a 1-for-6 basis. All of the share numbers, share prices, and exercise prices have been adjusted within our consolidated financial statements, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 1-for-6 reverse stock split. We paid cash in lieu of any fractional shares to which a holder of common stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the reverse stock split.\nOn August 12, 2013, we closed the IPO of our common stock. In the IPO, we sold 5,125,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.00 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 21,840,537 shares of common stock and all outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock converted into warrants to purchase 53,983 shares of our common stock.\nAcquisition Activity\nIn December 2012, we acquired Crowd Science, Inc., a U.S.-based audience targeting technology company, for approximately $1.1 million in cash and 2,000,000 shares of our Series D-1 preferred stock. We held back $49,000 in cash and 400,000 shares of our Series D-1 convertible preferred stock until the second anniversary of the closing date, for general representations and subject to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The performance conditions were not met in 2013. As such, we permanently withheld the contingent consideration. Our 1-for-6 reverse stock split in July 2013 and the conversion of preferred stock to common stock associated with our IPO in August 2013 resulted in the number of shares permanently held back by the Company to become 66,666 common stock shares. We account for the withheld shares as 66,666 shares of treasury stock.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\n (1) Stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations data above is as follows: \n\n (2) Excludes $544,000, $360,000 and $226,000 of stock-based compensation expense that was capitalized as part of internal-use software development costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nRevenue\nWe derive revenue principally from advertising solutions priced on a CPM basis, and measured by the number of advertising impressions delivered on digital media properties. A substantial majority of our contracts with customers take the form of ad insertion orders placed by advertising agencies on behalf of their brand advertiser clients, which are typically one to three months in duration. Occasionally, we enter into longer term contracts with customers.\nWe count direct advertising customers in accordance with the following principles: (i) we count each advertiser, not the advertising agencies through which its ad insertion orders may be placed, as the customer; and (ii) entities that are part of the same corporate structure are counted as a single customer. We also generate other revenue from digital media property owners, including platform fees, professional service fees and ad serving fees, and other revenue from intermediaries that have relationships with advertising agencies and advertisers. In calculating revenue per direct advertising customer, we exclude this other revenue.\nOur revenue tends to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry. For example, many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday and year-end purchasing activities. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects the highest advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity.\n\nFor 2015, revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 2.5%, compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by certain brand advertisers spending less on our platform due to the effects of prior operational issues and our currently immaterial participation in the programmatic channel. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during 2015 compared to the British pound and euro contributed to the decrease in revenue. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2015 was $171,000, a decrease of 13.6%, compared to $198,000 for 2014. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. We had 1,001 advertising customers in 2015, an increase of 13.8%, compared to 880 in 2014. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2015 accounted for $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our revenue, compared to $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue for 2014.\nFor 2014, revenue increased $26.7 million, or 17.6%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $26.5 million in net advertising sales. The increase in net advertising sales was primarily driven by an increase in the number of advertising customers, including those located in international markets. We had 880 advertising customers in 2014, an increase of 51.7%, compared to 580 in 2013. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2014 was $198,000, a decrease of 22.4%, compared to $255,000 for 2013. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new international customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2014 accounted for $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue, compared to $61.9 million, or 41.0%, of our revenue for 2013.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred with digital media property owners, typically under revenue-sharing arrangements. We refer to these costs as traffic acquisition costs. Generally, we incur traffic acquisition costs in the period the advertising impressions are delivered. In limited circumstances, we incur costs based on minimum guaranteed impressions. Cost of revenue also includes ad delivery costs such as labor and related costs, depreciation and amortization related to acquired technologies, internally developed software and data center assets, and Internet access costs. These expenses are classified as cost of revenue in the corresponding period in which the revenue is recognized. We expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to increase in absolute dollars in 2016, but to remain constant as a percentage of revenue. We expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to increase in absolute dollars, but to remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue.\n\nFor 2015, cost of revenue increased $1.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $6.1 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs, which was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in other costs of revenues. For 2015, cost of revenue, as a percentage of revenue, increased 2.4% to 54.8% from 52.4% for 2014, primarily as a result of higher traffic acquisition costs.\nFor 2014, cost of revenue increased $12.9 million, or 16.0%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $11.5 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs as a result of the increase in revenue, and a $1.4 million increase in other costs of revenues. For 2014, cost of revenue, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 0.7% to 52.4% from 53.1% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in revenue and the benefit of certain economies of scale.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell to our customers primarily through our direct sales force personnel, who have established relationships with major advertising agencies and direct relationships with advertisers. Our sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment expenses, and incentive compensation for our sales and marketing employees. Sales and marketing expenses also include promotional, advertising and public relations costs, as well as depreciation, facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.\n\nFor 2015, sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.2 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2015, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased by 2.0% to 34.6% from 36.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of the decrease in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nFor 2014, sales and marketing expenses increased $18.0 million, or 38.2%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $16.1 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees in our sales and marketing organization as it expanded, both domestically and internationally. Other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, increased $1.9 million. For 2014, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 5.4% to 36.6% from 31.2% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in research and development efforts to create and enhance our existing, data-science capabilities and proprietary technologies. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our engineers, product development and information technology personnel. Research and development expenses also include outside services and consulting, depreciation, facilities and other overhead costs. We capitalize a portion of our research and development costs attributable to internally developed software.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had 148, 91 and 89 research and development employees, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, 116 research and development employees were located in our Chennai and Pune, India offices. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in the research and development of our products, and to increase as a percentage of revenue in the short term. We believe that our eleven-year operating history and our ability to attract and retain the large pool of engineering talent available in India will help us expand our engineering resources and capabilities cost-effectively.\n\nFor 2015, research and development expenses increased $5.0 million, or 85.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to an increase of $3.6 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our research and development organization as it expanded, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, other departmental expenses, including equipment support and maintenance and depreciation, including depreciation expense related to capitalized internally developed software, increased $1.4 million. For 2015, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 3.0% to 6.3% from 3.3% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nFor 2014, research and development expenses increased $1.4 million, or 31.3%, compared to 2013. The increase was attributable to an increase of $0.7 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our research and development organization as it expanded, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, amortization and depreciation expense increased $0.7 million primarily related to purchases of computer equipment and software. For 2014, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 0.3% to 3.3% from 3.0% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. General and administrative expenses also include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our financial, accounting, human resources, information systems and legal personnel and resources to support our public reporting requirements, and to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\n\nFor 2015, general and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.5 million in professional service fees and consulting services as we placed greater reliance on internal employee labor rather than external consultants. For 2015, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 1.4% to 13.6% from 12.2% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in general and administrative employees and the associated increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nFor 2014, general and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million, or 20.8%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.3 million increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Additionally, other departmental expenses, including voice and data communications and insurance expenses, increased $2.3 million associated with the increase in the number of employees and additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Partially offsetting this increase were decreases of $0.6 million in professional service fees and $1.2 million in consulting services primarily related to our initial public offering in August 2013. For 2014, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 0.3% to 12.2% from 11.9% for 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in general and administrative employees and the associated increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense on our capital lease obligations, accretion and amortization on marketable securities, gains and losses on our derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains and losses., and prior to our IPO in August 2013, the revaluation of our outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants.\n\nFor 2015, interest and other expense, net decreased by $0.7 million, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.1 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2015. Our investments in derivative instruments are intended to mitigate a portion of our foreign transaction exchange gains and losses reported as income or expense on our statements of operations. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.1 million.\nFor 2014, interest and other income (expense), net increased by $0.6 million, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Euro and British pound sterling during 2014. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases in other expense was an increase in interest income on our marketable securities of $0.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013. We began investing our cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities during the fourth quarter of 2013.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and the realization of net operating loss carryforwards.\n\nFor 2015, income tax expense was primarily related to the federal alternative minimum tax, state taxes and taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nFor 2014, income tax benefit was primarily related to the full-year net loss before income taxes of $9.0 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude expenses for: interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management and the board of directors. This non-GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP information of other companies. Non-GAAP information should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made. The following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods indicated below:\n\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by us and the board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other GAAP results.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our unaudited quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following tables present unaudited quarterly results for 2015 and 2014. These tables include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider for the fair statement of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonality has caused, and is likely to continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nSelected summarized quarterly financial information for 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\n\n (a) Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2015, we had $60.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2015 are comprised of money market funds and corporate bonds. Cash held internationally as of December 31, 2015 totaled $7.4 million.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through private sales of convertible preferred stock. On August 12, 2013, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 5,125,000 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all of our convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into 21,840,537 shares of common stock, based on the shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding as of August 12, 2013. In addition, all outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock automatically converted into warrants to purchase 53,983 shares of common stock, and the preferred stock warrant liability of $0.4 million as of August 12, 2013 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\nIn November 2014, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB\u201d) to borrow up to a maximum of $25.0 million collateralized by our cash deposits, accounts receivable and equipment, as well as certain other assets. The Loan and Security Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and reporting covenants, including maintaining an adjusted quick ratio of 1.6 to 1.0. Annual fees under the agreement total one quarter of 1.0% of the average unused balance of the credit line per annum. As of December 31, 2015, YuMe had no borrowings outstanding under this credit line.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the cost of maintaining and improving our technologies, and our operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our solutions. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to obtain needed additional funds, we will have to reduce our operating expenses, which would impair our growth prospects and could otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities is receipts from the sale of our advertising solutions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are payments to publishers and other vendors for the purchase of digital media inventory and related costs, employee compensation and related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general operating expenses, and the purchase of property and equipment.\nWe used $1.1 million of cash in operating activities during 2015, primarily resulting from a net loss of $(16.7) million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization of $6.0 million; \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation of $8.9 million; \n \u2022 Bad debt expense of $1.0 million; \n \u2022 Amortization of premiums on marketable securities, net of $0.4 million; and \n \u2022 Deferred income taxes of $(0.3) million. \nIn addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in significant cash increases (decreases) as follows:\n \u2022 $(0.4) million from a net decrease in accounts payable, accrued digital media property owner costs and other accrued liabilities as a result of the timing of payments to our vendors; \n \u2022 $0.3 million from a decrease in accounts receivable due to a decrease in billings for advertising campaigns as well as timing of payments from these advertising customers; and \n \u2022 $(0.3) million from an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the timing of payments for rent, insurance and other operating costs. \nWe generated $6.8 million of cash from operating activities during 2014, primarily resulting from a net loss of $(8.7) million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization of $4.6 million; \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation of $5.8 million; \n \u2022 Bad debt expense of $1.2 million; \n \u2022 Amortization of premiums on marketable securities, net of $0.5 million; and \n \u2022 Deferred income taxes of $(0.3) million. \nIn addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in significant cash increases (decreases) as follows:\n \u2022 $9.1 million from an increase in accounts payable, accrued digital media property owner costs and other accrued liabilities as a result of the growth of our business and the timing of payments to our vendors; \n \u2022 $(4.1) million from an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in billings for advertising campaigns, especially during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, as well as timing of payments from these advertising customers; and \n \u2022 $(1.1) million from an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the timing of payments for rent, insurance and other operating costs. \nWe generated $0.5 million of cash from operating activities during 2013, primarily resulting from net income of $0.3 million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million; \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation of $3.8 million; \n \u2022 Bad debt expense of $0.5 million; and \n \u2022 Deferred income taxes of $(0.2) million. \nIn addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in significant cash increases (decreases) as follows:\n \u2022 $11.0 million from an increase in accounts payable, accrued digital media property owner costs and other accrued liabilities as a result of the growth of our business and the timing of payments to our vendors; \n \u2022 $(17.9) million from an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in billings for advertising campaigns, especially during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013, as well as timing of payments from these advertising customers; and \n \u2022 $(1.2) million from an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the timing of payments for rent, insurance and other operating costs. \nInvesting Activities\nPrior to 2013, our primary investing activities have consisted of (i) purchases of property and equipment to support the build out of our data centers and software to support website development and operations, and our corporate infrastructure, and (ii) acquisitions. Purchases of property and equipment may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations and website and internal-use software and development. During 2013, we purchased marketable securities using cash proceeds we received from our IPO in August 2013.\nWe used $21.1 million of cash for investing activities during 2015, primarily as follows:\n \u2022 $14.2 million to purchase short- and long-term marketable securities, net of maturities; \n \u2022 $2.8 million to purchase property, equipment and software; \n \u2022 $3.7 million to develop software for internal use; and \n \u2022 $0.4 million increase in restricted cash associated with a new building lease. \nWe used $15.5 million of cash for investing activities during 2014, primarily as follows:\n \u2022 $7.6 million to purchase short- and long-term marketable securities, net of maturities and sales; \n \u2022 $5.9 million to purchase property, equipment and software; and \n \u2022 $2.0 million to develop software for internal use. \nWe used $25.2 million of cash for investing activities during 2013, primarily as follows:\n \u2022 $21.5 million to purchase short- and long-term marketable securities; \n \u2022 $2.0 million to purchase property, equipment and software; and \n \u2022 $1.8 million to develop software for internal use. \nFinancing Activities\nPrior to our IPO, our financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, notes payable with a bank and the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options. In our IPO, which closed on August 12, 2013, we issued and sold 5,125,000 shares of common stock at a price of $9.00 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $40.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.2 million and offering expenses of $2.9 million.\nWe generated $2.1 million of cash from financing activities during 2015 from the exercise of common stock options.\nWe generated $4.2 million of cash from financing activities during 2014. We received $4.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by $0.3 million of repayments of borrowings under notes payable and capital leases.\nWe generated $39.4 million of cash from financing activities during 2013. We received $40.0 million of net cash proceeds in connection with our IPO and $0.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by $0.8 million of repayments of borrowings under notes payable and capital leases.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, solutions to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California, under operating lease agreements that expire through September 2027. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. Rent expense under operating leases totaled $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe also enter into agreements with digital media property owners that require the purchase of a minimum number of impressions on a monthly or quarterly basis. Our purchase commitments expire on various dates through December 2016.\nOur future minimum payments under these arrangements as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We have determined our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 will not result in any additional taxes payable by us. As a result, no amounts are shown in the table above relating to uncertain tax positions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, internal-use software development costs, business combinations, income taxes and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is principally derived from advertising services measured by the number of advertising impressions displayed on digital media properties owned and controlled by third party digital media property owners and priced on a CPM basis. We recognize revenue when: (1) persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been provided; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. For all revenue transactions, we consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Our arrangements generally do not include a provision for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact revenue recognition. Arrangements for these services generally have a term of up to three months and in some cases the term may be up to one year.\nIn the normal course of business, we act as a facilitator in executing transactions with third parties. The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether we act as the principal or an agent, we follow the accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. While none of the factors identified in this guidance is individually considered presumptive or determinative, because we are the primary obligor and are responsible for (i) identifying and contracting with third party advertisers, (ii) establishing the selling prices of the advertisements sold, (iii) performing all billing and collection activities including retaining credit risk and (iv) bearing sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising, we act as the principal in these arrangements and therefore reports revenue earned and costs incurred on a gross basis.\nWe generally recognize revenue based on delivery information from a combination of third party reporting and our proprietary campaign tracking systems. Revenue is attributed to the U.S. and individual foreign countries based on the domicile of the salesperson that facilitated the revenue generating transaction.\nMultiple-element Arrangements\nWe enter into arrangements with customers to sell advertising packages that include different media placements or ad services that are delivered at the same time, or within close proximity of one another.\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to all deliverables, based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available; (2) third party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE is not available; and (3) best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nVSOE-We evaluate VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the standalone selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We historically have not entered into a large volume of single element arrangements, so we have not been able to establish VSOE for any of our advertising products.\nTPE-When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services' selling prices are on a standalone basis. As a result, we have not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\nBESP-When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a standalone basis. BESP is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in our multiple element arrangements. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, class of advertiser, size of transaction, seasonality, observed pricing trends, available online inventory, industry pricing strategies, market conditions and competitive landscape. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables. We will regularly review BESP. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe recognize the relative fair value of the media placements or ad services as they are delivered assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nDeferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition\nInternal-use Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs related to software developed for internal use. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in product development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional features or functionality are capitalized and expensed over the estimated useful life of the enhancements, generally three years.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire a business, we determine the acquisition purchase price as the sum of the consideration we provide. When we issue stock-based awards to an acquired company's selling stockholders, we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-business combination services. Our evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the stock-based awards is contingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as future compensation expense over the required service period.\nWe allocate the purchase price in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. To date, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business combinations have primarily consisted of acquired working capital and definite-lived intangible assets. The carrying value of acquired working capital is assumed to be equal to its fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We maintain a full valuation allowance to offset domestic net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets. Our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 was attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from U.S. net operating losses, foreign timing differences and other deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $23.5 million, expiring beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $20.5 million, expiring beginning in 2016. As of December 31, 2015 we had federal research and development tax credits of approximately $1.0 million, expiring beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2015, we had state research and development tax credits of approximately $0.9 million, and other tax credits of $0.3 million, both of which carry forward indefinitely.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relative tax law, and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) a determination is made as to whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option valuation model is affected by our common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, we may adopt the standard in either its first quarter of 2018 or 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP but retains the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently and expands the guidance to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply ASU 2015-01 prospectively. A reporting entity may also apply ASU 2015-01 retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. We believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to adopt this update prospectively as of December 31, 2015. Prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments--Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). This standard requires entities that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The standard is effective for fiscal years and the interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td>
