Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and export and import terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or LPG,\u201d and ethane); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and export and import terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, export and import terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems. Our assets currently include approximately 50,000 miles of pipelines; 260 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity.\nThe safe operation of our assets is a top priority. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. For additional information, see Environmental, Safety and Conservation\u201d within the Regulatory Matters section of Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. We, Enterprise GP, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC are affiliates under the collective common control of the DD LLC Trustees and the EPCO Trustees. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the ASA\u201d) or by other service providers.\nOur operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold.\nEach of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our related marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle ( non-GAAP\u201d) financial measure, for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are subject to certain significant risks. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include domestic and international economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., federal and state regulation, the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in upstream exploration and production activities and the credit quality of our customers. For information regarding such risks, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.\nIn addition, our business activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing a wide variety of topics, including commercial, operational, environmental and other matters. For a discussion of the principal effects of such laws and regulations on our business activities, see Regulatory Matters\u201d included under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report.\nSignificant Recent Developments\nEnterprise Provides Distribution and Buyback Guidance for 2020\nIn January 2020, management announced its plans to continue to recommend to the Board of Enterprise GP an increase of $0.0025 per unit per quarter to our cash distribution rate with respect to 2020. The anticipated rate of increase would result in distributions for 2020 (of $1.805 per unit) being 2.3% higher than those paid with respect to 2019 (of $1.765 per unit). The payment of any quarterly cash distribution is subject to Board approval and management's evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payments.\nIn addition, management announced its intention to use approximately 2.0% of net cash flow provided by operating activities, or cash flow from operations ( CFFO\u201d), in 2020 to repurchase EPD common units under the Buyback Program approved in January 2019 (the 2019 Buyback Program\u201d). For information regarding the 2019 Buyback Program, including repurchases of common units in 2019, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Common Unit Buyback Program\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Mentone Natural Gas Processing Facility\nIn December 2019, we completed the first processing train at our Mentone cryogenic natural gas processing facility ( Mentone I\u201d) and placed it into service. The Mentone facility, which is located in Loving County, Texas, has a current capacity to process 300 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract more than 40 MBPD of NGLs. Mentone and its related infrastructure further extends our presence in the Delaware Basin and provides producers access to our fully integrated midstream asset network, including our Texas Intrastate System and Shin Oak NGL Pipeline. We own and operate the Mentone facility and related infrastructure. With Mentone I in operation, we have the capability to process up to 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 250 MBPD of NGL production from our processing facilities in the Delaware Basin.\nOn a related note, we completed and placed into service a third processing train ( Orla III\u201d) at our cryogenic natural gas processing facility located near Orla, Texas in Reeves County in July 2019. The Orla facility is capable of processing up to 900 MMcf/d of natural gas and extracting up to 140 MBPD of NGLs. Like Mentone, the Orla facility and related infrastructure supports continued growth of NGL-rich natural gas production from the Delaware Basin. We own and operate the Orla facility.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Bulldog Natural Gas Processing Plant\nIn November 2019, we placed our Bulldog cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which is located near Carthage, Texas, into service. The Bulldog plant has the capability to process up to 200 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 12 MBPD of NGLs. When combined with our legacy Panola cryogenic plant, Bulldog provides us with the capacity to process up to a total of 320 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 18 MBPD of NGLs in the region. The new plant supports continued growth of natural gas production from the Cotton Valley and Haynesville formations in East Texas. In addition, the Bulldog plant complements our value chain as the mixed NGLs produced at the plant are transported on the Panola pipeline to Mont Belvieu for fractionation.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit\nIn December 2019, we completed construction and placed our isobutane dehydrogenation ( iBDH\u201d) unit into service. The facility, which is located at our Mont Belvieu complex and supported by long-term, fee-based contracts, is capable of processing approximately 25 MBPD of butane into nearly 1 billion pounds per year of isobutylene. Production from the iBDH plant will enable us to optimize our methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE\u201d) and high purity isobutylene ( HPIB\u201d) assets and meet growing market demand for isobutylene.\nSteam crackers and refineries have historically been the major source of propane and butane olefins for downstream use; however, with the increased use of light-end feedstocks such as ethane, the need for on purpose\u201d olefins production has increased. Like our PDH facility, the iBDH plant will help meet market demand where traditional supplies have been reduced. The iBDH plant will increase our production of high purity and low purity isobutylene, both of which are used as feedstocks to manufacture lubricants, rubber products and fuel additives.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Ethylene Export Terminal\nIn December 2019, we placed our ethylene export terminal into limited service, with the first cargo of 25 million pounds of ethylene exported in January 2020. The terminal, which we operate, is located at our Morgan's Point facility on the Houston Ship Channel and features two docks and the capacity to load 2.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year. A refrigerated storage tank for 66 million pounds of ethylene is being constructed on-site that will allow the terminal to load ethylene up to a rate of 2.2 million pounds per hour. Full commercial operations at the terminal are expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are complete. We own a 50% member interest in Enterprise Navigator Ethylene Terminal LLC, which owns the export facility.\nOur ethylene system is being developed to serve as an open market storage and trading hub for the ethylene industry using storage capacity, connections to multiple ethylene pipelines, and high-volume export capabilities. In support of our ethylene business, we recently placed into service a high-capacity underground ethylene storage well at our Mont Belvieu complex having a storage capacity of 600 million pounds of ethylene. The storage well is connected to our Morgan's Point ethylene export terminal by a 16-mile pipeline, which was placed into service in December 2019. An additional 8 miles of ethylene pipelines extending from Morgan's Point to Bayport, Texas are under construction and expected to be completed and placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn May 2019, we announced plans to further expand our ethylene pipeline and logistics system by constructing the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas, which is a leading growth area for new ethylene crackers and related facilities. The Baymark pipeline will originate in Bayport, Texas and extend approximately 90 miles to Markham, Texas. The Baymark pipeline is supported by long-term customer commitments and is expected to begin service in the fourth quarter of 2020. We will own a 70% interest in and operate the Baymark pipeline. Customers using the Baymark pipeline will have access to our high-capacity ethylene storage well in Mont Belvieu and our export terminal at Morgan's Point.\nEnterprise Announces Final Investment Decision Regarding the Sea Port Oil Terminal\nIn July 2019, we announced the execution of long-term customer agreements with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. ( Chevron\u201d) supporting the development of our Sea Port Oil Terminal ( SPOT\u201d) in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of the Chevron agreements, we announced our final investment decision with respect to SPOT, subject to obtaining the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing our SPOT application.\nThe SPOT project consists of onshore and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30 nautical miles off the Brazoria County, Texas coast in approximately 115 feet of water. SPOT is designed to load Very Large Crude Carriers ( VLCCs\u201d) at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. We believe that SPOT's design meets or exceeds federal requirements for such facilities and, unlike existing and other proposed offshore terminals, is designed with a vapor control system to minimize emissions.\nIn December 2019, we announced the execution of a letter of intent ( LOI\u201d) with an affiliate of Enbridge Inc. ( Enbridge\u201d) to jointly develop our SPOT in the Gulf of Mexico. Under terms of the LOI, we agreed to negotiate an equity participation right agreement with Enbridge whereby, subject to SPOT receiving a deepwater port license, an affiliate of Enbridge could acquire a noncontrolling member interest in SPOT Terminal Services LLC, which owns SPOT.\nEnterprise to Build Midland-to-ECHO 4 Pipeline\nIn October 2019, we announced long-term agreements supporting construction of the Midland-to-ECHO 4\u201d pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline will connect our Midland terminal in Midland, Texas with our ECHO terminal in Houston, Texas utilizing both new construction and segments of our existing crude oil pipelines in South Texas. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline is expected to enter service during the second quarter of 2021 and have an initial transportation capacity of 450 MBPD (expandable up to 540 MBPD). When placed into service, the Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline will allow our shippers with crude oil and condensate production in both the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale to maximize the value of their contracted pipeline capacity by allowing shippers to source barrels from the Permian Basin and/or the Eagle Ford Shale. This unmatched flexibility will allow shippers and producers to dynamically match their pipeline capacity to their allocation of capital and respective production profiles between the two basins. Their production will be delivered into our integrated storage, pipeline, distribution and marine terminal system that has access to both domestic and international markets.\nThe Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline complements our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and 2 pipelines, which entered full service in the second quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, respectively, as well as our Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline, which is comprised of a 29% undivided interest in a 36-inch pipeline we are currently constructing from Midland, Texas to our ECHO terminal and further to a third-party terminal in Webster, Texas, is expected to provide 200 MBPD of transportation capacity when placed into service during the third quarter of 2020, increasing to approximately 450 MBPD during the fourth quarter of 2020. Together, these four projects (Midland-to-ECHO 1, 2, 3 and 4) comprise our Midland-to-ECHO System, which supports crude oil production growth from the Permian Basin (and Eagle Ford Shale, as applicable) by providing producers and other shippers with transportation solutions that are both cost-efficient and operationally flexible. The Midland-to-ECHO System is expected to include 6 MMBbls of storage at our Midland terminal and access to more than 45 MMBbls of storage and approximately 4 MMBPD of export capacity at partnership assets along the Texas Gulf Coast. The network connects to every refinery in the Houston, Texas City and Beaumont/Port Arthur area, which we believe represents approximately 8 MMBPD of refining capacity.\nIn January 2019, we completed the conversion of the Midland-to-Sealy segment of one of our two Seminole NGL pipelines from NGL service to crude oil service, thus creating the Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline. The pipeline originates at our Midland terminal and extends 444 miles to our Sealy terminal, with crude oil volumes arriving at Sealy transported to our ECHO terminal using the Rancho II pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which was placed into limited service in February 2019 and full service in April 2019, provides us with up to 225 MBPD of incremental crude oil transportation capacity. We retain the flexibility to convert this pipeline back to NGL service should future market conditions support the need for additional NGL transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin.\nEnterprise to Build Second Propane Dehydrogenation ( PDH\u201d) Plant\nIn September 2019, we announced the execution of long-term, fee-based contracts with affiliates of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. that support construction of our second PDH facility (referred to as PDH 2\u201d). The new plant is expected to have the capacity to consume up to 35 MBPD of propane and produce up to 1.65 billion pounds per year of PGP. PDH 2 will be located in Chambers County, Texas at our Mont Belvieu complex and is scheduled to begin service in the first quarter of 2023. Once PDH 2 is placed into service and integrated with PDH 1 and our other propylene production facilities, we will have the capability to produce 11 billion pounds of propylene per year.\nEnterprise to Expand and Extend Acadian Gas System\nIn September 2019, we announced plans to expand and extend our Acadian Gas System in order to deliver growing natural gas production from the Haynesville Shale to the liquefied natural gas ( LNG\u201d) market in South Louisiana. The expansion project will include construction of an approximately 80-mile natural gas pipeline (the Gillis Lateral\u201d) extending from near Cheneyville, Louisiana to third-party pipeline interconnects near Gillis, Louisiana, including multiple pipelines serving regional LNG export facilities. In addition to construction of the Gillis Lateral, we plan to increase the transportation capacity of the Haynesville Extension from 1.8 Bcf/d to 2.1 Bcf/d by adding horsepower at our compressor station in Mansfield, Louisiana. The Mansfield project and construction of the Gillis Lateral are supported by long-term customer contracts and are expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2021. Once the expansion project is completed, we expect that our Acadian Gas System will be able to deliver up to 2.1 Bcf/d of Haynesville Shale production into the LNG market, South Louisiana industrial complex and other pipeline interconnects that serve attractive southeastern U.S. markets.\nShin Oak NGL Pipeline Commences Operations; Altus Acquires 33% Equity Interest in Shin Oak\nThe Shin Oak NGL Pipeline ( Shin Oak\u201d) transports NGL production from the Permian Basin to our NGL fractionation and storage complex located at the Mont Belvieu hub. In February 2019, the 24-inch diameter mainline segment of Shin Oak from Orla, Texas to Mont Belvieu was placed into limited service with an initial transportation capacity of 250 MBPD. In June 2019, an additional pipeline segment, the 20-inch diameter Waha lateral, was placed into service and increased Shin Oak's transportation capacity to 350 MBPD. We completed construction of the remaining components of Shin Oak in the fourth quarter of 2019, which increased its transportation capacity to 550 MBPD.\nIn May 2018, we granted Apache Midstream LLC ( Apache\u201d) an option to acquire up to a 33% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns Shin Oak. In November 2018, Apache contributed this option to Altus Midstream Processing LP ( Altus\u201d), which is a consolidated subsidiary of Apache. In July 2019, Altus exercised the option and acquired a 33% equity interest (effective July 31, 2019) in our subsidiary that owns Shin Oak. As a result, we received a $440.7 million cash payment from Altus, which is included in contributions from noncontrolling interests as presented on our Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nExpansion Projects at EHT\nIn July 2019, we announced expansion projects at EHT that are expected to increase our loading capacity for crude oil and LPG at the terminal. With respect to crude oil, we are adding an eighth deep-water ship dock at EHT that is expected to increase our crude oil loading capacity by 840 MBPD, thereby increasing our overall nameplate crude oil loading capacity at EHT to 2.75 MMBPD, or nearly 83 MMBbls per month. The new dock is designed to accommodate a Suezmax vessel, which is the largest ship class that can navigate the Houston Ship Channel, and is scheduled to be placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWith respect to LPG, our current estimated maximum loading capacity at EHT is approximately 835 MBPD, with 175 MBPD of this loading capacity placed into service during the third quarter of 2019. The expansion project announced in July 2019 is currently expected to increase our LPG loading capacity at EHT by an additional 265 MBPD and be placed into service during the second half of 2021. When this latest expansion project is completed, EHT will have a new maximum LPG loading capacity of approximately 1.1 MMBPD, or 33 MMBbls per month.\nIn light of growing international demand for PGP, we also announced in July 2019 an expansion project at EHT that is currently expected to increase its export capability for semi- or fully-refrigerated PGP by 3,500 barrels per hour, or approximately 84 MBPD. Our current loading capacity at EHT for PGP is approximately 2,500 barrels per hour, or 60 MBPD, of semi-refrigerated product. With the addition of fully refrigerated volumes due to the expansion project, EHT will be able to co-load fully refrigerated PGP and LPG volumes onto the same vessel. This expansion project is expected to be placed into service during the second half of 2021.\nGeneral Outlook for 2020\nWe provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are contingent on the supply of, and demand for the energy commodities we handle across our integrated midstream energy asset network. The following information presents our views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals going into 2020.\nSupply Side Observations\nThe upstream energy industry, led by the efforts of major oil companies, continues to shift resources to shale supply basins. Domestic shale resources continue to play a key role in both U.S. and global markets, further supporting that the U.S. is a major oil supplier on par with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) and Russia. The U.S. became a net natural gas exporter on an annual basis in 2017, and it continued to export more natural gas than it imported in both 2018 and 2019. We believe that a significant portion of the expected growth in U.S. crude oil, natural gas and NGL production in 2020 will be destined for export markets.\nAs measured by New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d), WTI oil prices started 2019 at $45.41 per barrel but rapidly increased to $66.30 per barrel on April 23, 2019 as OPEC and Russia maintained their supply cuts and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Iran, which restricted crude oil exports from that country to a minimum. However, prices subsequently softened as a result of continued trade disputes between the U.S. and other countries, with China in particular. Counteracting these trade headwinds\u201d was the fact that crude oil production growth in the U.S. was slowing in response to producers cutting back on drilling activities in an effort to preserve cash and enhance their financial condition in a capital-constrained environment. Consequently, WTI prices fluctuated between $51 and $66 per barrel for the rest of 2019. The WTI oil price finished 2019 at $61.06 per barrel and averaged $57.03 per barrel for all of 2019 compared to an average of $64.77 per barrel for 2018. WTI prices in 2020 have ranged from a high of $63.27 per barrel to a low of $49.57 per barrel through February 10, 2020. The forward commodity markets for WTI (as reported by the NYMEX) currently indicate monthly pricing in the range of $51.17 to $52.11 per barrel for periods extending through February 2021.\nAs reported by the EIA, U.S. crude oil production, having finished 2018 at 12 MMBPD, spent the first seven months of 2019 between 11.7 MMBPD and 12.1 MMBPD. Nevertheless, U.S. crude oil production accelerated during the latter part of the year at a record high of 12.9 MMBPD in November 2019. In addition, as reported by the EIA, U.S. production of NGLs increased steadily throughout 2019 and averaged a record 4.8 MMBPD for the year. For 2018, U.S. production of NGLs averaged 4.4 MMBPD. The focus of U.S. exploration and production companies in 2019 was more on exercising capital discipline than increasing production. Rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) reflect this emphasis, declining 26% over the course of 2019 from 1,083 in December 2018 to 805 in December 2019. However, not all regions slowed equally. The Permian Basin rig count fell 17% while the Haynesville Shale rig count fell 6%, whereas the Cana Woodford rig count fell 64%. As rig counts declined and fewer wells were drilled in 2019, producers gradually began to work off their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells ( DUCs\u201d). As reported by the EIA, the DUC count declined to approximately 7,600 in November 2019 from 8,000 in December 2018. Of the current DUCs, approximately 3,600 are in the Permian Basin. DUCs represent a significant potential volume that will continue to be brought into production.\nNear-term global economic growth has been adversely impacted by the emergence of the coronavirus, officially designated as Covid-19, in China, and then in several other countries and regions including the U.S., Japan and Europe. As a result of this public health concern, a significant amount of global commerce has been affected due to travel restrictions, quarantines, and similar measures. Analysts from S&P recently estimated that the virus could lower China's gross domestic product by approximately 1% in 2020, with a peak effect in the first quarter of 2020 before rebounding in the third quarter of 2020. Overall, economists estimate that headwinds from the virus could reduce global economic growth in 2020 by 0.2% to 0.3%, while in the U.S. first quarter of 2020 growth could be reduced by 0.2% to 0.4%. The impact of reduced hydrocarbon demand in Asia due to the virus has been felt in the price of crude oil. WTI prices have declined approximately 22% since the beginning of 2020 (as reported by the NYMEX), which we believe was largely attributable to perceived global economic weakness caused by responses to the virus. In response to the crisis, OPEC is considering production cuts to limit the potential oversupply of crude oil in global markets. We continue to monitor this situation and its potential impact on our operations.\nU.S. natural gas production increased from an average of 84 Bcf/d in 2018 to 91 Bcf/d in 2019 per the EIA. As a result, natural gas prices, as measured by the NYMEX at Henry Hub, averaged $2.53 per MMBtu in 2019 compared to an average of $3.07 per MMBtu in 2018. Henry Hub natural gas prices in 2020 have ranged from a high of $2.20 per MMBtu to a low of $1.77 per MMBtu through February 10, 2020. The decline in price is generally due to lower demand due to warmer winter weather and abundant natural gas supplies due to shale production. The forward commodity markets for Henry Hub natural gas (as reported by the NYMEX) currently indicate monthly pricing in the range of $1.85 to $2.61 per MMBtu for periods extending through March 2021, with longer term prices currently indicated at $2.20 to $3.20 per MMBtu. Assuming stable natural gas prices, we believe that U.S. natural gas production should be sufficient to meet both domestic and export demand.\nWith the continued growth in shale production, the EIA reports that the U.S. is becoming a major exporter of natural gas, with LNG exports averaging 4.6 Bcf/d in 2019 and pipeline exports to Mexico averaging 5.1 Bcf/d in 2019. With the completion of several construction projects by the end of 2020, U.S. LNG liquefaction capacity (according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC\u201d)) is expected to exceed 9 Bcf/d, which we believe will make natural gas production and prices highly sensitive to fluctuations in LNG exports. In fact, some in the industry would argue that U.S. gas prices could become more dependent on international LNG markets in contrast to being traditionally dependent on domestic demand and weather.\nWe operate in a number of major domestic supply basins, including the Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Rockies. The following information represents our general outlook for each of these key basins:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>The Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico has experienced the largest increase in production in the country. According to the December 2019 EIA Drilling Productivity Report ( 2019 EIA Report\u201d), production in the Permian Basin was 4.7 MMBPD of crude oil and 16.3 Bcf/d of natural gas in November 2019. The basin continues to have many advantages relative to other producing regions, including up to 10 or more stacked pay zones, light sweet crude oil and significant infrastructure. With 405 drilling rigs working in the Permian Basin as of December 2019 (as reported by Baker Hughes), and major oil companies such as Exxon and Chevron focused on developing their presence in the basin, we expect production to continue to grow.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA prime example of our commitment to Permian Basin producers is our Midland-to-ECHO System. This network supports crude oil production growth from the basin by providing producers and other shippers with transportation solutions that are both cost efficient and operationally flexible. We placed our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipelines into full commercial service during the second quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2019, respectively. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 and Midland-to-ECHO 4 projects are expected to begin service during the third quarter of 2020 and first half of 2021, respectively. When fully complete, our Midland-to-ECHO System is expected to provide us with up to 1.8 MMBPD of crude oil transportation capacity to U.S. Gulf Coast and international markets, while assuring the quality and grade of the crude oil being shipped.\nAn area of particular focus for us has been the development of midstream infrastructure serving producers in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the Permian Basin. Prior to the shale production boom, the Delaware Basin was a lightly drilled area due to a lack of conventional targets; however, with the introduction of horizontal drilling techniques and identification of stacked targets of tight rock and shales, drilling in the Delaware Basin has accelerated greatly over the past five years. These drilling targets have proven to produce not only crude oil but also condensate and NGLs, which present us with a significant number of opportunities to provide midstream services to producers. We are actively working with producers to identify those midstream infrastructure projects that best serve their needs and complement our integrated asset network.\nTwo examples of our initiatives in the Delaware Basin are the Orla and Mentone natural gas processing facilities. At our Orla processing facility, we placed two processing trains (Orla I and II) into service in 2018, and a third processing train (Orla III) was placed into service in July 2019. With three trains, the Orla facility has 900 MMcf/d of total processing capacity and allows us to extract up to 140 MBPD of mixed NGLs. Our Mentone natural gas processing facility was announced in October 2018 and its first processing train (Mentone I) entered service in December 2019. Following the completion of Mentone I, we have the capability to process up to 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 250 MBPD of NGLs from our processing facilities in the Delaware Basin. Given our investment in NGL pipeline infrastructure in the region (e.g., Shin Oak), we believe that we are well positioned to accommodate NGL production growth from these plants and third party natural gas processing facilities in the Permian Basin.\nOverall, we have a positive outlook regarding the Permian Basin and continue to evaluate projects that meet the midstream needs of producers.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>In the Eagle Ford Shale ( Eagle Ford\u201d), crude oil and natural gas production for 2019 was essentially the same as that for 2018. According to the 2019 EIA Report, production in the Eagle Ford was 1.4 MMBPD of crude oil and 6.9 Bcf/d of natural gas in November 2019. The number of drilling rigs working in the Eagle Ford (as reported by Baker Hughes) decreased from 80 at the beginning of 2019 to 67 in December 2019; however, it appears that the rig count has stabilized as we enter 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduction acreage in the Eagle Ford continued to change ownership during 2019, which contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. ConocoPhillips, EOG and other producers continue to show strong interest in the Eagle Ford, which could result in higher volumes for our midstream network; however, until volumes for the basin exceed historical peak production, there will be excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. According to the EIA, the historical peak for Eagle Ford crude oil and natural gas production occurred in March 2015 and was 1.7 MMBPD and 7.4 Bcf/d, respectively.\nWe believe that the Eagle Ford offers producers some of the best returns on capital of any region in the country due to its proximity to major consumption and export markets along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we believe that our integrated midstream network will provide us with operating leverage as production increases.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>With respect to the Haynesville Shale ( Haynesville\u201d), natural gas production is increasing due to higher rig counts and improved drilling efficiencies. As reported by Baker Hughes, the number of gas drilling rigs working in the Haynesville has increased from a low of 11 rigs in 2016 to an average of 52 rigs in 2019. Like the Eagle Ford, we saw several significant changes in the ownership of producing properties in 2019, which contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. According to the 2019 EIA Report, natural gas production in the Haynesville reached record levels in 2019, with production increasing to approximately 12.3 Bcf/d in November 2019. Assuming supportive natural gas prices, we believe these trends will continue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the Haynesville and the associated Bossier Shale plays hold a combined 304 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources, which is the second highest level in the U.S. after the Appalachia region. The Haynesville benefits from its close proximity to U.S. Gulf Coast markets where significant petrochemical plant projects and LNG export facilities are being constructed. According to the FERC, the LNG market in South Louisiana and Southeast Texas, including facilities under construction, is expected to reach an aggregate 15 Bcf/d of export capacity. In September 2019, we announced construction of the Gillis Lateral and Mansfield compressor station project, both of which will support continued production growth in the Haynesville.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>In the Rocky Mountain region, rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) in the Piceance and San Juan basins and also in the Jonah field were essentially flat in 2019 when compared to 2018; however, the predominant producer in the Pinedale field suspended drilling in 2019 due to low commodity prices. As we move into 2020, we expect that Piceance, San Juan and Jonah producers will continue a modest level of conventional drilling with certain developments showing encouraging long-term trends. In the Piceance Basin, operators have drilled several horizontal wells in the Williams Fork formation and obtained permits for deeper wells in the Mancos Shale. In the San Juan Basin, operators continue to drill horizontal wells in both the crude oil and natural gas horizons of the Mancos Shale. In the Jonah field, producers saw positive results from recent horizontal well tests and plan to continue these efforts into 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProducers in the Rockies benefit from sufficient natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure, which helps the region compete with other North American regions where production takeaway capacity is constrained. We believe that our Rocky Mountain assets will continue to benefit regional producers by allowing them access to major downstream markets such as U.S. Gulf Coast and export destinations.\nDemand Side Observations\nGlobal economic growth continues to drive demand for petroleum-based products. In February 2020, the International Energy Agency ( IEA\u201d) reported that global demand for crude oil and NGLs grew by a combined 1.0 MMBPD in 2019 and expects demand to grow by approximately 0.8 MMBPD in 2020. Recent statements by the IEA and other sources suggest that the coronavirus will soften near-term global demand for hydrocarbons, particularly in Asia, in the first quarter of 2020, with a likely rebound in demand during the third quarter of 2020. In December 2019, the IEA forecast that overall long-term demand for crude oil and NGLs by the countries represented by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD\u201d) will decline by approximately 0.3 MMBPD between 2019 and 2024, while non-OECD demand would increase by 6 MMBPD over the same period. The IEA expects that petrochemicals will account for approximately 31% of the increase in long-term global demand for crude oil and NGLs over this period. As its reference case, the IEA's long-term outlook for crude oil and NGL demand points to either a plateau after 2030, or to slow growth of approximately 0.2% from 2025 to 2040.\nWe, along with a majority of forecasters, expect that long-term demand for liquid hydrocarbons such as crude oil and NGLs should not decline before the year 2040. Demand for liquid hydrocarbons is generally driven by the following sectors: airline and rail transportation, marine bunker fuel, motor fuels (gasoline and diesel) for cars, trucks and similar vehicles, industrial users, residential and commercial heating, and feedstocks in petrochemical and plastics manufacturing. Practically speaking, liquid hydrocarbons cannot be reasonably or economically replaced for each of these uses by other forms of energy in this forecast period given current technologies. Although the IEA and other forecasters project electric-powered vehicles modestly supplanting gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles in certain markets during this period, the decrease in motor fuel demand is outweighed by demand growth in other sectors for liquid hydrocarbons.\nWe continuously review third-party economic forecasts in connection with our long-term planning. In general, third party forecasts such as the IEA's are subject to a variety of assumptions including: (i) current views of leading economic forecasters and demographers with respect to assumed economic and demographic trends; (ii) improvements in energy production, delivery and consumption technologies; (iii) current laws and regulations that affect the energy sector are unchanged throughout the 2020-2050 projection period; (iv) future commodity prices and (v) reduced costs for renewables. Changes to these and other assumptions by forecasters may yield higher or lower outlooks for hydrocarbon demand and supply over the long-term.\nThe North American shale revolution\u201d has transformed the U.S. into the global, low-cost supplier of NGLs. We expect this trend to continue into 2020 and beyond supported by, among other things: (i) the ability of U.S. shale producers to reduce development costs and improve the productivity of new and existing wells, (ii) regulatory changes in various international markets such as India and China favoring the use of clean-burning fuels and low-sulfur hydrocarbons such as those found in U.S. shale oil basins and (iii) higher demand in developing economics for liquid hydrocarbons in general. As a midstream energy company, we continue to foresee a variety of long-term, demand-side opportunities from these developments, including higher demand from the U.S. petrochemical industry and increased exports of hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, LPG and crude oil) to growing international markets.\nInternational demand for U.S. ethane is expected to remain robust in 2020, as ethane from domestic shale basins offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option plus supply diversification. Our Morgan's Point Ethane Export Terminal, the largest of its kind in the world, enables us to meet this demand and has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane.\nWith respect to the U.S. petrochemical industry, abundant supplies of shale-sourced ethane provides the U.S. with one of the cheapest feedstocks available for ethylene production. The American Chemistry Council estimates that over $200 billion is being invested in domestic petrochemical plants, with most of those investments tied directly to producing ethylene from cost-advantaged U.S. ethane. Of the new domestic facilities, seven world-scale ethylene plants are currently operational and we estimate that they have a combined ethylene production capacity of 17.7 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 490 MBPD. An additional four plants are being commissioned and expected to enter service in 2020, with an estimated aggregate ethylene production capacity of 7.2 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 205 MBPD. An additional four plants are expected to enter service in the early 2020s. We anticipate that these later plants will have a combined ethylene production capacity of 7.5 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 205 MBPD. We also anticipate demand growth for ethane as a feedstock resulting from modifications (e.g., debottlenecking, furnace modifications, etc.) made to other existing domestic facilities.\nOur midstream assets are located in close proximity to virtually all domestic ethane-consuming petrochemical plants, as well as associated derivative plants that produce various polymer products from ethylene. As a result of the expected growth in U.S. ethylene production capacity, we completed and commissioned an ethylene export terminal located at Morgan's Point on the Houston Ship Channel in December 2019. The project, which is underwritten by long-term customer commitments, is expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are completed.\nTo a limited extent, global demand for the end products produced by the petrochemical and plastics sector is currently under pressure mostly due to improper plastic disposal methods, particularly the accumulation of plastic garbage in the world's oceans. This situation has resulted in calls for better collection, recycling and disposal of plastics and bans of certain single-use plastic items. Although higher recycling rates and bans of certain single-use items would effectively reduce the rate of growth in global demand for plastics, we do not believe that such actions will result in a significant long-term decline in the production of plastics (or in the use of liquid hydrocarbons as feedstocks in the production of such items).\nWith respect to long-term LPG demand, we believe that U.S. exports to Asia, particularly China and India, as well as markets in Northwest Europe and Latin America, will continue to be strong. According to EIA data available through November 2019, U.S. LPG exports increased 17% in 2019 to 1.4 MMBPD, with volumes headed to Asian markets accounting for approximately 51% of this amount. We estimate that LPG exports could reach 2.5 to 2.8 MMBPD by 2025. Our outlook for LPG exports to Asia is supported by several factors including long-term economic growth rates in Asian markets and favorable domestic policies in countries like India and Indonesia where governments are subsidizing their population's switch from wood-based fuels to LPG for domestic use as a means of reducing pollution and protecting against deforestation. The competitiveness of U.S. Gulf Coast supplies of LPG are enhanced by the recent widening of the Panama Canal in 2016. Due to our expectation of continued growth in LPG exports, we completed an expansion project at EHT in 2019 that increased our LPG loading capacity at the terminal to approximately 835 MBPD. In July 2019, we announced an additional expansion project at EHT that would increase our LPG loading capacity by an additional 265 MBPD and be placed into service during the second half of 2021.\nLastly, as U.S. crude oil production increased, these new domestic barrels continue to supplant more of the U.S.'s crude oil imports, while the remainder are exported to international markets in Central and South America, Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes are used as feedstock in their refining and petrochemical facilities. We expect U.S. refiners to continue to operate at high rates as a result of steady U.S. demand and growing exports of refined products. We believe that our marine terminals and related storage and pipeline infrastructure that handle crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals are strategically located to meet the concurrent needs of export and import customers. We have significant export capabilities, with expansion potential, on the Houston Ship Channel, Beaumont, Freeport and Texas City, Texas.\nIn July 2019, we announced long-term agreements with Chevron that support the development of SPOT in the Gulf of Mexico. SPOT is designed to load VLCCs at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. Construction of SPOT remains subject to obtaining the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing our SPOT application. SPOT would provide customers with an integrated export solution that leverages our extensive supply, storage and distribution network along the Gulf Coast, with access to approximately 6 MMBbls of crude oil supply and more than 300 MMBbls of storage based on our estimates.\nSelected Energy Commodity Price Data\nThe following table presents selected average index prices for natural gas and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods indicated:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Polymer\n</td> <td>Refinery\n</td> <td>Indicative Gas\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Natural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Normal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Natural\n</td> <td>Grade\n</td> <td>Grade\n</td> <td>Processing\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Gas,\n</td> <td>Ethane,\n</td> <td>Propane,\n</td> <td>Butane,\n</td> <td>Isobutane,\n</td> <td>Gasoline,\n</td> <td>Propylene,\n</td> <td>Propylene,\n</td> <td>Gross Spread\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>$/MMBtu\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/pound\n</td> <td>$/pound\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 by quarter:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1st Quarter\n</td> <td>$3.01\n</td> <td>$0.25\n</td> <td>$0.85\n</td> <td>$0.96\n</td> <td>$1.00\n</td> <td>$1.41\n</td> <td>$0.53\n</td> <td>$0.33\n</td> <td>$0.40\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2nd Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.80\n</td> <td>$0.29\n</td> <td>$0.87\n</td> <td>$1.00\n</td> <td>$1.20\n</td> <td>$1.53\n</td> <td>$0.52\n</td> <td>$0.37\n</td> <td>$0.47\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3rd Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.91\n</td> <td>$0.43\n</td> <td>$0.99\n</td> <td>$1.21\n</td> <td>$1.25\n</td> <td>$1.54\n</td> <td>$0.60\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> <td>$0.58\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4th Quarter\n</td> <td>$3.65\n</td> <td>$0.35\n</td> <td>$0.79\n</td> <td>$0.91\n</td> <td>$0.94\n</td> <td>$1.22\n</td> <td>$0.51\n</td> <td>$0.35\n</td> <td>$0.34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 Averages\n</td> <td>$3.09\n</td> <td>$0.33\n</td> <td>$0.88\n</td> <td>$1.02\n</td> <td>$1.10\n</td> <td>$1.43\n</td> <td>$0.54\n</td> <td>$0.38\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 by quarter:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1st Quarter\n</td> <td>$3.15\n</td> <td>$0.30\n</td> <td>$0.67\n</td> <td>$0.82\n</td> <td>$0.85\n</td> <td>$1.16\n</td> <td>$0.38\n</td> <td>$0.24\n</td> <td>$0.31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2nd Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.64\n</td> <td>$0.21\n</td> <td>$0.55\n</td> <td>$0.63\n</td> <td>$0.65\n</td> <td>$1.21\n</td> <td>$0.37\n</td> <td>$0.24\n</td> <td>$0.25\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3rd Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.23\n</td> <td>$0.17\n</td> <td>$0.44\n</td> <td>$0.51\n</td> <td>$0.66\n</td> <td>$1.06\n</td> <td>$0.38\n</td> <td>$0.23\n</td> <td>$0.21\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4th Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.50\n</td> <td>$0.19\n</td> <td>$0.50\n</td> <td>$0.68\n</td> <td>$0.82\n</td> <td>$1.20\n</td> <td>$0.35\n</td> <td>$0.21\n</td> <td>$0.25\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 Averages\n</td> <td>$2.63\n</td> <td>$0.22\n</td> <td>$0.54\n</td> <td>$0.66\n</td> <td>$0.75\n</td> <td>$1.16\n</td> <td>$0.37\n</td> <td>$0.23\n</td> <td>$0.26\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub Inside FERC commercial index prices as reported by Platts, which is a division of McGraw Hill Financial, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>NGL prices for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline are based on Mont Belvieu Non-TET commercial index prices as reported by Oil Price Information Service.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>Polymer grade propylene prices represent average contract pricing for such product as reported by IHS Chemical, a division of IHS Inc.

Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products decreased a combined net $2.54 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $4.7 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which resulted in a $2.16 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased $993.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $540.7 million decrease, and lower sales prices, which resulted in an additional $452.7 million decrease. In addition, revenues from the marketing of natural gas decreased a net $336.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices.\nRevenues from midstream services for 2019 increased $121.5 million when compared to 2018. Revenues from our pipeline assets increased $250.0 million year-to-year primarily due to strong demand for transportation services in Texas. Our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and 2 pipelines accounted for a combined $206.8 million of this increase. Revenue from our Mont Belvieu storage complex increased $94.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage, throughput and other fees. In addition, revenues from our terminal assets increased $75.8 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in loading volumes at EHT. Revenues from our natural gas plants decreased a net $285.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues attributable to the equity NGLs we receive as non-cash consideration for processing services, which accounted for a $452.3 million decrease, partially offset by the addition of revenues from our recently completed Orla facility, which accounted for a $142.8 million increase. The year-to-year decline in revenues attributable to equity NGLs is primarily due to lower NGL prices in 2019 when compared to 2018.\nLargest customer information\nSubstantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base. Our largest non-affiliated customer for 2019 and 2018 was Vitol Holding B.V. and its affiliates (collectively, Vitol\u201d), which accounted for 10.1% and 7.8%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Vitol is a global energy and commodity trading company.\nOperating costs and expenses\nTotal operating costs and expenses for 2019 decreased $4.34 billion when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products decreased a combined net $2.93 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $4.81 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $1.87 billion increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased $1.37 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $924.1 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $446.9 million decrease. In addition, the cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas decreased $420.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices.\nOther operating costs and expenses for 2019 increased a net $122.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher chemical and maintenance expenses, ad valorem taxes, and employee compensation costs, which accounted for a combined $137.7 million increase. The higher costs for 2019 were partially offset by a $33.9 million charge recognized in 2018 in connection with an earnings allocation arrangement with an affiliate of Western Midstream Partners, LP ( WES\u201d) involving the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $161.3 million year-to-year primarily due to assets placed into full or limited service since 2018 (e.g., the Shin Oak and Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipelines).\nNon-cash asset impairment charges increased $82.2 million year-to-year primarily due to the $76.4 million write-off of our equity method investment in Centennial Pipeline LLC and the planned shutdown of certain natural gas processing assets in Texas and Louisiana.\nGeneral and administrative costs\nGeneral and administrative costs for 2019 increased $3.4 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher employee-related costs partially offset by lower legal costs.\nEquity in income of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2019 increased $83.0 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines.\nOperating income\nOperating income for 2019 increased $670.1 million when compared to 2018 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates.\nInterest expense\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest charged on debt principal outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,251.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,195.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest costs capitalized in connection with construction projects (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(143.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(147.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,243.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,096.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amounts presented for 2019 and 2018 includes $23.1 million and $29.4 million, respectively, of swaption premium income.

Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2019 was $27.41 billion compared to $25.94 billion for 2018. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital investments. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations and capital investments, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Capital Investments,\u201d respectively, within this Part II, Item 7.\nIn July 2019, we sold options to be put into forward-starting swaps (referred to as swaptions\u201d) if the market rate of interest fell below the strike rate of the option upon expiration of the derivative instrument. The premium we realized upon sale of these swaptions is reflected as a $13.3 million reduction in interest expense for 2019. Due to declining interest rates, the counterparties to these swaptions exercised their right to put us into ten forward-starting swaps on September 30, 2019 having an aggregate notional value of $1.0 billion. Since the swaptions were not designated as hedging instruments and were subject to mark-to-market accounting, we incurred an unrealized, mark-to-market loss at inception of the forward-starting swaps totaling $94.9 million that is reflected as an increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. The ten forward-starting swaps resulting from the swaption exercise on September 30, 2019 were designated as hedging instruments and are subject to cash flow hedge accounting.\nChange in fair value of Liquidity Option\nWe recognize non-cash expense in connection with accretion and changes in management estimates that affect our valuation of the Liquidity Option liability. Expense attributable to changes in the fair value of the Liquidity Option increased to $119.6 million in 2019 from $56.1 million in 2018. The higher level of expense recognized in 2019 is primarily due to a decrease in the discount factor used in determining the present value of the liability since December 31, 2018. The discount rate is based on a weighted-average cost of capital, which declined over the course of 2019 due to lower U.S. interest rates.\nThe counterparty to the Liquidity Option exercised its rights under the option agreement on February 25, 2020. For additional information regarding the exercise, see Exercise of Liquidity Option\u201d under the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item 7. In addition, please refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nGain on step acquisition of unconsolidated affiliate\nWe recognized a non-cash gain of $39.4 million during 2018 related to the step acquisition of Delaware Basin Gas Processing LLC ( Delaware Processing\u201d). For information regarding this acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nIncome taxes\nOur provision for income taxes, which primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (the Texas Margin Tax\u201d), decreased $14.7 million in 2019 when compared to 2018. Our partnership is not subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, our partners are individually responsible for paying federal income tax on their share of our taxable income.\nBusiness Segment Highlights\nWe evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results.\nThe following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross operating margin by segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NGL Pipelines & Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,069.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,830.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Crude Oil Pipelines & Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,087.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,511.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural Gas Pipelines & Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,062.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>891.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Petrochemical & Refined Products Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,069.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,057.8\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total segment gross operating margin (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,289.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,291.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,265.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,325.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management's evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin.\nThe GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled Consolidated Income Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,078.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,408.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin\n(addition or subtraction indicated by sign):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,848.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,687.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment and related charges in operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gains attributable to asset sales in operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,265.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,325.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.\nNGL Pipelines & Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Segment gross operating margin:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,159.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,240.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL pipelines, storage and terminals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,402.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,048.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL fractionation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>507.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>542.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,069.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,830.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selected volumetric data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,461\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>626\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>593\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>945\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,282\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,831\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our natural gas processing facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNatural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities\nGross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2019 decreased $80.4 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our Rockies natural gas processing facilities (Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco) decreased a combined $130.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $108.0 million decrease, and lower processing and other fees, which accounted for an additional $19.0 million decrease. On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing volumes at these plants increased 58 MMcf/d and equity NGL production volumes decreased 13 MBPD year-to-year.\nGross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $63.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $153.3 million increase, partially offset by lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $91.1 million decrease. Results from marketing strategies that optimize our transportation, storage and export assets increased a combined $80.5 million year-to-year, partially offset by lower earnings from the optimization of our plant assets, which accounted for a $10.7 million decrease. In addition, results from NGL marketing decreased $6.0 million year-to-year due to non-cash, mark-to-market activity.\nGross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing facilities decreased $17.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for an $18.3 million decrease, and lower processing volumes, which accounted for an additional $9.3 million decrease, partially offset by higher processing and deficiency fees, which accounted for a $12.0 million increase. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production from our South Texas plants decreased 121 MMcf/d and 4 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas processing facilities decreased $12.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $26.3 million decrease, partially offset by higher fee-based processing volumes, which accounted for a $9.4 million increase.

Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline and related business activities increased $146.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a $133.0 million increase in non-cash mark-to-market earnings, higher transportation volumes, which accounted for a $30.1 million increase, and lower expenses, which accounted for a $27.8 million increase, partially offset by lower average transportation fees, which accounted for a $91.5 million decrease. Expenses in 2018 for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline included a $33.9 million charge attributable to the allocation of pipeline earnings to WES upon closing of their acquisition of a 20% ownership interest in Whitethorn Pipeline Company LLC (which owns the majority of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline) in June 2018. Net to our interest, transportation volumes for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline increased 43 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which commenced operations in February 2019, was $99.9 million on transportation volumes of 197 MBPD.\nMark-to-market earnings attributable to the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline are associated with the hedging of crude oil market price differentials (basis spreads) between the Midland and Houston markets based on the pipeline's capacity available to us during the hedged periods. These hedges served to lock in a positive per barrel margin on our anticipated purchases of crude oil at Midland and subsequent anticipated sales to customers in the Houston area. The mark-to-market loss in 2018 of $44.6 million reflected an increase in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets to an average of $8.48 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $2.76 per barrel through 2020 (as of December 31, 2018). The mark-to-market gain in 2019 of $88.4 million reflected a decrease in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets since December 31, 2018 to an average of $1.81 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $1.95 per barrel through 2020. At December 31, 2019, there were a limited number of these hedges outstanding. For information regarding our commodity hedging activities, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nGross operating margin from other crude oil marketing activities increased a net $58.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins. These marketing activities benefitted from higher market price differentials for crude oil between the Permian Basin region, Cushing hub and Gulf Coast markets.\nGross operating margin from our West Texas System and equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a combined $82.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 64 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $17.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fees. Transportation volumes on the South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased 15 MBPD year-to-year.\nGross operating margin from our equity investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $75.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes, which accounted for a $47.0 million increase, and higher transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $46.5 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $27.4 million decrease. Transportation volumes on the Seaway Pipeline increased 55 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). Volumes at Seaway's Texas City and Freeport marine terminals decreased a combined 22 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest).\nLastly, gross operating margin from crude oil activities at EHT increased $83.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher net export volumes of 243 MBPD.\nNatural Gas Pipelines & Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Segment gross operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,062.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>891.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas pipeline transportation volumes (BBtus/d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,198\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,727\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for 2019 increased $171.4 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased $122.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins attributable to regional natural gas price spreads.\nGross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $46.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher capacity reservation fees. Transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System increased 124 BBtus/d.

Natural gas gathering volumes on the Permian Basin Gathering System increased 357 BBtus/d. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System decreased $18.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a 94 BBtus/d decrease in gathering volumes, which accounted for a $10.1 million decrease, and lower condensate sales, which accounted for an additional $4.8 million decrease.\nPetrochemical & Refined Products Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Segment gross operating margin:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propylene production and related activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>445.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>462.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Butane isomerization and related operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Octane enhancement and related plant operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Refined products pipelines and related activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>330.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marine transportation and other services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,069.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057.8\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selected volumetric data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propylene production volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standalone DIB processing volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Octane additive and related plant production volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pipeline transportation volumes, primarily refined products & petrochemicals (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>739\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Refined products and petrochemical marine terminal volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>353\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPropylene production and related activities\nGross operating margin from propylene production and related marketing activities for 2019 decreased $17.5 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene splitters decreased $29.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins, which accounted for a $65.0 million decrease, lower average propylene fractionation fees, which accounted for a $13.3 million decrease, and lower propylene production volumes, which accounted for an additional $11.2 million decrease, partially offset by higher propylene sales volumes, which accounted for a $59.2 million increase. Propylene production volumes from our splitter units decreased 4 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our PDH 1 facility, which was placed into service in April 2018, increased $14.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher propylene and associated by-product sales volumes. Plant production for PDH 1, which includes by-products, increased 2 MBPD year-to-year.\nButane isomerization and related operations\nGross operating margin from butane isomerization and deisobutanizer ( DIB\u201d) operations for 2019 decreased $13.5 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower average by-product sales prices, which accounted for a $9.5 million decrease, and higher operating costs, which accounted for an additional $5.3 million decrease.\nOctane enhancement and related plant operations\nGross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and HPIB plants for 2019 increased an aggregate $11.9 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $26.4 million increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $13.9 million decrease. Additionally, our iBDH facility, which completed construction and was placed into service during December 2019, had a gross operating loss of $4.8 million, primarily due to start-up costs incurred prior to being placed into service.\nRefined products pipelines and related activities\nGross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2019 increased $10.5 million when compared to 2018.\nGross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased $18.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fee revenues, which accounted for a $26.1 million increase, and higher average transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $8.9 million increase, partially offset by lower transportation volumes, which accounted for an $18.3 million decrease. Transportation volumes on the TE Products Pipeline decreased 79 MBPD primarily due to lower refined products and petrochemical product movements. Gross operating margin from refined products terminals associated with our TE Products Pipeline decreased $12.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs, which accounted for a $7.5 million decrease, and lower facility throughput fee revenues, which accounted for an additional $4.5 million decrease.\nGross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities increased $9.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for an $18.7 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for an $8.9 million decrease. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a loss of $7.2 million in 2019 compared to a $1.7 million gain in 2018.\nGross operating margin from our refined products terminal in Beaumont, Texas decreased $11.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower storage revenues, which accounted for a $7.7 million decrease, and lower terminaling volumes of 23 MBPD, which accounted for an additional $3.3 million decrease.\nMarine transportation and other services\nGross operating margin from marine transportation for 2019 increased $20.4 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher barge fees, which accounted for $31.8 million of the increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for an $11.3 million decrease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital investments and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2019, we had $4.85 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $4.52 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO's revolving credit facilities and $334.7 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\nWe may issue equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the 2019 Shelf\u201d) on file with the SEC which allows EPD and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. The 2019 Shelf replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement, which expired in May 2019.\nCommon Unit Buyback Program\nIn January 2019, we announced that the Board of Enterprise GP had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the 2019 Buyback Program\u201d), which provides EPD with an additional method to return capital to investors. The 2019 Buyback Program authorizes EPD to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and negotiated transactions. The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including (i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on investment, (iii) EPD's unit price and implied cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted financial leverage with a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of approximately 3.5 times. No time limit has been set for completion of the program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nEPD repurchased 2,909,128 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market purchases in 2019 (no repurchases were made during the third or fourth quarters of 2019). The total purchase price of these repurchases was $81.1 million, excluding commissions and fees. The repurchased units were cancelled immediately upon acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was $1.92 billion.\nAs noted previously, management announced in January 2020 its intention to use approximately 2.0% of CFFO in 2020 to repurchase EPD common units under the 2019 Buyback Program.\nExercise of Liquidity Option\nIn October 2014, we acquired approximately 65.9% of the limited partner interests of Oiltanking Partners, L.P. ( Oiltanking\u201d), all of the member interests of OTLP GP, LLC, the general partner of Oiltanking ( Oiltanking GP\u201d), and the incentive distribution rights held by Oiltanking GP from Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. ( OTA\u201d), a U.S. corporation, as the first step ( Step 1\u201d) of a two-step acquisition of Oiltanking. In February 2015, we completed the second step of this transaction consisting of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking. In order to fund the equity consideration paid in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, we issued 54,807,352 common units to OTA on October 1, 2014 in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. We also entered into a put option agreement (the Liquidity Option Agreement\u201d or Liquidity Option\u201d) with OTA and Marquard & Bahls AG ( M&B\u201d), a German corporation and the ultimate parent company of OTA, in connection with Step 1. Under the Liquidity Option Agreement, EPD granted M&B the option to sell to the partnership 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OTA at any time within a 90-day period commencing on February 1, 2020. On February 25, 2020, the partnership received notice from M&B of M&B's election to exercise its Liquidity Option right.\nThe Liquidity Option Agreement permits M&B to allow deferred tax liabilities to remain with OTA, including tax liabilities existing at the time of the sale of Oiltanking to us in 2014, and for M&B to directly receive EPD common units upon settlement of the Liquidity Option exercise that are unencumbered by any such liabilities. As a result, the liquidity of M&B is enhanced following exercise and settlement of the option, when compared to its financial position prior thereto (hence the name Liquidity Option\u201d). Under the terms of the Liquidity Option Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid by EPD for OTA's capital stock at settlement will equal the volume-weighted sales price of EPD common units for the 10-trading day period immediately preceding the exercise notice date, multiplied by the 54,807,352 EPD common units owned by OTA. The consideration paid by the partnership may be in the form of newly issued EPD common units, cash or any mix thereof, as determined solely by EPD. Settlement of the option exercise transaction is expected to occur on March 5, 2020. The partnership currently expects that it will elect to deliver to M&B (or its designated affiliate) 54,807,352 newly issued EPD common units (in lieu of any cash) in connection with such settlement.\nThe acquisition of OTA upon settlement of the Liquidity Option will be accounted for as the purchase of treasury units and the assumption of related deferred income taxes. Assuming that we issue only EPD common units to M&B as consideration (in lieu of any cash consideration), the number of EPD common units outstanding would not increase as the 54,807,352 newly issued units would be offset by the 54,807,352 EPD common units held by OTA that are reclassified to treasury units.\nFor additional information regarding the Liquidity Option and the effects of the option exercise, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nConsolidated Debt\nThe following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2019 for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Scheduled Maturities of Debt\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2024\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Principal amount of senior and junior debt obligations at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,878.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,982.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,325.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,400.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,250.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,071.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIssuance of $3.0 Billion of Senior Notes in January 2020\nIn January 2020, EPO issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2030 ( Senior Notes AAA\u201d), (ii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2051 ( Senior Notes BBB\u201d) and (iii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2060 ( Senior Notes CCC\u201d).

Senior Notes CCC were issued at 99.360% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 3.95% per year. EPD has guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.\nIssuance of $2.5 Billion of Senior Notes in July 2019\nIn July 2019, EPO issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due July 2029 ( Senior Notes YY\u201d) and $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2050 ( Senior Notes ZZ\u201d). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the repayment of debt and for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments.\nSenior Notes YY were issued at 99.955% of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 3.125% per year. Senior Notes ZZ were issued at 99.792% of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.20% per year. EPD has guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.\nAmendment to Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn September 2019, EPO entered into an amendment (the First Amendment\u201d) to its revolving credit agreement dated September 13, 2017 (the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d). The First Amendment reduces the borrowing capacity under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement from $4.0 billion to $3.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $500 million to $4.0 billion at EPO's election provided certain conditions are met) and extends the maturity date to September 10, 2024, although the maturity date may be extended further at EPO's request by up to two years, with the consent of required lenders as set forth under the credit agreement. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general company purposes. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.\nRenewal of 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn September 2019, EPO entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement that replaced its prior 364-day credit facility. The new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2020. Under the terms of the new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO's election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of up to 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as non-revolving term loans for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2021. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general company purposes. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.\nFor additional information regarding our debt agreements, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.\nCredit Ratings\nAt February 28, 2020, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO's long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor's, Baa1 from Moody's and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO's short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor's, P-2 from Moody's and from Fitch Ratings. EPO's credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies.\nIssuance of Common Units\nThe following table summarizes the issuance of new common units in connection with our distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) and employee unit purchase plan ( EUPP\u201d) for the years indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown):\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCommon\nUnits Issued\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Cash\nProceeds\nReceived\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,861,951\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,897,990\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>The decrease in net cash proceeds from the DRIP and EUPP between 2018 and 2019 is primarily due to (i) lower reinvestments by privately held affiliates of EPCO in 2019, (ii) lower levels of reinvestment by participants due to a reduction in the DRIP discount from 2.5% to 0% beginning with the distribution paid in February 2019 and (iii) the election to satisfy delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP using common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, beginning with the distribution paid in August 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash proceeds from the issuance of new common units for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO's commercial paper program and for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments.\nDRIP and EUPP\nEPD has registration statements on file with the SEC in connection with its DRIP and EUPP.\nThe DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional common units at a discount ranging from 0% to 5%. Beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017 and paid in February 2018, the DRIP discount was reduced from 5% to 2.5%. Likewise, beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2018 and paid in February 2019, the DRIP discount was reduced from 2.5% to 0%. The EUPP provides employees of EPCO a voluntary means by which they can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions.\nWe have the sole discretion to determine whether common units purchased under the DRIP and EUPP will come from our authorized but unissued common units or from common units purchased on the open market by the plan's administrator. In July 2019, EPD announced that, beginning with the quarterly distribution payment paid in August 2019, it would use common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP. This election is subject to change in future quarters depending on the partnership's need for equity capital.\nThe preceding table shows the number of new common units issued to participants in the DRIP and EUPP during the two years ended December 31, 2019. A total of 2,801,196 additional common units were purchased on the open market in 2019 and delivered to participants in connection with the DRIP and EUPP. Other than amounts attributable to the plan discount available to all participants in the EUPP, the funds used to effect the open market purchases were sourced entirely from the DRIP and EUPP participants. No other partnership funds were used to satisfy these delivery obligations. We used open market purchases to fully satisfy DRIP and EUPP investments in connection with the distribution paid on February 12, 2020. After taking into account the number of common units delivered to participants under the DRIP and EUPP through December 31, 2019, we have the capacity to deliver an additional 56,320,229 and 4,596,585 common units, respectively, under these plans.\nATM Program\nWe have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $2.54 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings in connection with our ATM program. Pursuant to this program, we may sell common units from time-to-time under an equity distribution agreement between EPD and certain broker-dealers by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. After taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through December 31, 2019, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $2.54 billion. We did not issue any common units under the ATM program during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nFor additional information regarding our consolidated equity, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nCash Flow Statement Highlights\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,520.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,126.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,575.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,281.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,945.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,504.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels.\nWe may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from independent and major integrated oil and gas companies and other pipelines and wholesalers. These concentrations may affect our overall credit risk in that these energy industry customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.\nThe following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts:\nOperating activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities in 2019 increased a net $394.2 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>a $779.2 million year-to-year increase resulting from higher partnership earnings in 2019 when compared to 2018 (determined by adjusting our $448.6 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>an $88.6 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to investments in crude oil pipeline businesses; partially offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>a $473.6 million year-to-year decrease primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see Results of Operations\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2019 increased a net $293.9 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to:\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>a $308.5 million year-to-year increase in expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment (see Capital Investments\u201d within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>a $140.6 million year-to-year decrease in proceeds from asset sales primarily due to the sale of our former Red River System in October 2018 for $134.9 million; partially offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>a $150.6 million year-to-year decrease in net cash used for business combinations.

Prior to this change, EPD issued an aggregate 2,897,990 common units, which generated $82.2 million of net cash proceeds, in connection with the DRIP and EUPP in 2019.

In June 2018, WES acquired a 20% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns a majority of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline for $189.6 million in cash. In addition, cash contributions from noncontrolling interests in connection with the construction of our ethylene export facility increased $43.5 million year-to-year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Cash Flow Measures\nDistributable Cash Flow\nOur partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets.\nIn January 2020, the Board declared a cash distribution of $0.4450 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, our management announced plans to recommend to the Board additional quarterly cash distribution increases of $0.0025 per unit with respect to each of the four quarters of 2020. For additional information regarding our expected distribution growth rate, see Significant Recent Developments\u201d within this Item 7.\nWe measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow ( DCF\u201d), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our distribution coverage ratio was approximately 1.7 times when compared to the sum of our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to fiscal 2019. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nBased on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike several other master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests.\nOur use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see Cash Flow Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nThe following table summarizes our calculation of DCF for

In general, FCF is a measure of how much cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital investments, including expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects. By comparison, only sustaining capital expenditures are reflected in DCF.\nWe believe that FCF is important to traditional investors since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, common unit repurchases and similar matters. Since business partners fund certain capital projects of our consolidated subsidiaries, our determination of FCF reflects the amount of cash contributed from and distributed to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of FCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOur use of FCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nFCF fluctuates based on our earnings, the level of investing activities we undertake each period, and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments. The following table summarizes our calculation of FCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,520.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,126.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to net cash flows provided by operating activities to derive FCF\n(addition or subtraction indicated by sign):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,575.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,281.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>632.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FCF (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,471.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,001.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe elements used in calculating FCF are sourced directly from our statements of consolidated cash flows presented under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For a discussion of significant year-to-year changes in our cash flow statement amounts, see Cash Flow Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nCapital Investments\nAn important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations, asset acquisitions, and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and other domestic shale plays. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions.\nWe placed $5.4 billion of major growth capital projects into service during 2019, including Shin Oak, Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, iBDH facility, Mentone I, Bulldog natural gas plant at our Carthage processing facility, expansion of LPG loading capacity at EHT, and our Morgan's Point ethylene export terminal. At February 1, 2020, we had $7.7 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023 including the following major projects:\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>two NGL fractionators in Chambers County, Texas ( Frac X,\u201d first quarter of 2020; Frac XI,\u201d third quarter of 2020),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>expansion of our Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline (second quarter of 2020):\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>the Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline (third through fourth quarters of 2020),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>expansion of our natural gas pipelines in northeast Texas in support of our Carthage natural gas processing facility (third quarter of 2020),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>completion of the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas (fourth quarter of 2020),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>an eighth deep-water ship dock at EHT for loading crude oil (fourth quarter of 2020),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>expansion of our ethylene export capabilities at Morgan's Point (fourth quarter of 2020),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>our Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline (second quarter of 2021),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>expansion of our LPG and PGP export capabilities at EHT (second half of 2021),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>expansion and extension of Acadian Gas System (Gillis Lateral and related projects) (third quarter of 2021),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>addition of incremental capacity at our isomerization facility (first quarter of 2022),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>construction of our PDH 2 facility (first quarter of 2023).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2020 to approximate $3.4 billion to $4.4 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion and approximately $400 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For 2021, we anticipate our total capital investments in growth capital projects to approximate $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. Our forecast of capital investments for 2020 and 2021 is based on announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change due to decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities.\nOur success in raising capital, including partnering with other companies to share project costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions.\nThe following table summarizes our capital investments for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital investments for property, plant and equipment: (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Growth capital projects (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,208.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,902.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sustaining capital projects (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>323.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,531.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,223.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used for business combinations, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investments in unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets.

Our most significant growth capital investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 involve projects at our Mont Belvieu complex, crude oil pipelines in Texas and expansion projects involving our Gulf Coast export terminals. Fluctuations in investments in sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects.\nInvestments in growth capital projects at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $623.5 million year-to-year primarily due to construction activities surrounding Frac X and Frac XI, which accounted for a combined $479.0 million increase, our iBDH facility, which accounted for a $115.1 million increase, and expansion projects involving our DIBs, which accounted for an additional $87.2 million increase, partially offset by lower expenditures attributable to PDH 1 and Frac IX, which accounted for a combined $185.3 million decrease. PDH 1 and Frac IX were both placed into service during the second quarter of 2018. We placed our iBDH facility into service in December 2019.\nInvestments in growth capital projects related to our ethylene business (e.g., pipelines, storage facilities and export terminal) increased $207.4 million year-to-year.\nInvestments in growth capital projects in support of Permian Basin production decreased $532.1 million year-to-year primarily due to completion of Shin Oak, which accounted for a $524.4 million decrease, and Orla natural gas processing facility, which accounted for an additional $358.4 million decrease, partially offset by increased expenditures for the construction of Mentone I, which accounted for a $249.6 million increase. Shin Oak entered limited service in February 2019, with full capacity available in December 2019. Orla III entered service in July 2019 and Mentone I commenced operations in December 2019.\nNet cash used for business combinations during 2018 reflects our acquisition of a 50% member interest in Delaware Processing in March 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies:\nDepreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment\nIn general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset's cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $41.6 billion and $38.74 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.56 billion and $1.44 billion of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments\nLong-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable through future cash flows. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products.\nThe carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset's estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes.\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a potential loss in value of the investment attributable to an other than temporary decline. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity's industry. In the event we determine that the value of an investment is not recoverable due to an other than temporary decline, we record a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful lives of the investment's underlying assets.\nA significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time.\nIn 2019 and 2018, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets and equity method investments of $127.5 million and $46.8 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding impairment charges, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nValuation and Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets\nThe specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate.\nCustomer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities.\nIn other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals.\nThe value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin.\nContract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements.\nIf our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset's carrying value is not recoverable through its future cash flows, we would be required to reduce the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.45 billion and $3.61 billion, respectively. We recorded $174.7 million and $170.3 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nMethods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, our goodwill balance was $5.75 billion. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, we evaluate goodwill for impairment on December 31 of each year or when impairment indicators (e.g., the loss of a significant customer, adverse long-term supply or demand trends, or technological obsolescence of assets) are present.\nTesting goodwill for impairment involves a two-step process. As Step 1 of the process, if impairment indicators are present, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned is determined and compared to its carrying value. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets that comprise the reporting unit. These assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets classified within the reporting unit, which, in turn, rely on management's estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. We believe that the assumptions we use in estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their fair value estimation process. As Step 2 of the process, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including associated goodwill), a non-cash impairment charge to earnings is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d This ASU simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 for future goodwill impairment testing.\nFor additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nUse of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses\nAs noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements. Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines.\nOur most significant routine estimates involve revenues and costs of certain natural gas processing facilities, pipeline transportation revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs. These types of transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded.\nChanges in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on currently available information to determine if adjustments are required. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nOther Matters\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment or Settlement due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>In less than\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>In 1-3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>In 4-5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,878.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,982.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,100.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,071.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated cash payments for interest (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,264.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,224.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,255.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,084.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,700.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product purchase commitments (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,574.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,798.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,274.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,228.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,273.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service payment commitments (4,5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>335.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital expenditure commitments (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other long-term liabilities (7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>860.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>738.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total contractual payment obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,230.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,162.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,517.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,551.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,999.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents scheduled future maturities of our current and long-term debt principal obligations.

Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and export and import terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or LPG,\u201d and ethane); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and export and import terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, export and import terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems. Our assets currently include approximately 50,000 miles of pipelines; 260 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity.\nThe safe operation of our assets is a top priority. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. For additional information, see Environmental, Safety and Conservation\u201d within the Regulatory Matters section of Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. We, Enterprise GP, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC are affiliates under the collective common control of the DD LLC Trustees and the EPCO Trustees. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the ASA\u201d) or by other service providers.\nOur operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold.\nEach of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our related marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle ( non-GAAP\u201d) financial measure, for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are subject to certain significant risks. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include domestic and international economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., federal and state regulation, the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in upstream exploration and production activities and the credit quality of our customers. For information regarding such risks, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.\nIn addition, our business activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing a wide variety of topics, including commercial, operational, environmental and other matters. For a discussion of the principal effects of such laws and regulations on our business activities, see Regulatory Matters\u201d included under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report.\nSignificant Recent Developments\nEnterprise Provides Distribution and Buyback Guidance for 2020\nIn January 2020, management announced its plans to continue to recommend to the Board of Enterprise GP an increase of $0.0025 per unit per quarter to our cash distribution rate with respect to 2020. The anticipated rate of increase would result in distributions for 2020 (of $1.805 per unit) being 2.3% higher than those paid with respect to 2019 (of $1.765 per unit). The payment of any quarterly cash distribution is subject to Board approval and management's evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payments.\nIn addition, management announced its intention to use approximately 2.0% of net cash flow provided by operating activities, or cash flow from operations ( CFFO\u201d), in 2020 to repurchase EPD common units under the Buyback Program approved in January 2019 (the 2019 Buyback Program\u201d). For information regarding the 2019 Buyback Program, including repurchases of common units in 2019, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Common Unit Buyback Program\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Mentone Natural Gas Processing Facility\nIn December 2019, we completed the first processing train at our Mentone cryogenic natural gas processing facility ( Mentone I\u201d) and placed it into service. The Mentone facility, which is located in Loving County, Texas, has a current capacity to process 300 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract more than 40 MBPD of NGLs. Mentone and its related infrastructure further extends our presence in the Delaware Basin and provides producers access to our fully integrated midstream asset network, including our Texas Intrastate System and Shin Oak NGL Pipeline. We own and operate the Mentone facility and related infrastructure. With Mentone I in operation, we have the capability to process up to 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 250 MBPD of NGL production from our processing facilities in the Delaware Basin.\nOn a related note, we completed and placed into service a third processing train ( Orla III\u201d) at our cryogenic natural gas processing facility located near Orla, Texas in Reeves County in July 2019. The Orla facility is capable of processing up to 900 MMcf/d of natural gas and extracting up to 140 MBPD of NGLs. Like Mentone, the Orla facility and related infrastructure supports continued growth of NGL-rich natural gas production from the Delaware Basin. We own and operate the Orla facility.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Bulldog Natural Gas Processing Plant\nIn November 2019, we placed our Bulldog cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which is located near Carthage, Texas, into service. The Bulldog plant has the capability to process up to 200 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 12 MBPD of NGLs. When combined with our legacy Panola cryogenic plant, Bulldog provides us with the capacity to process up to a total of 320 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 18 MBPD of NGLs in the region. The new plant supports continued growth of natural gas production from the Cotton Valley and Haynesville formations in East Texas. In addition, the Bulldog plant complements our value chain as the mixed NGLs produced at the plant are transported on the Panola pipeline to Mont Belvieu for fractionation.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit\nIn December 2019, we completed construction and placed our isobutane dehydrogenation ( iBDH\u201d) unit into service. The facility, which is located at our Mont Belvieu complex and supported by long-term, fee-based contracts, is capable of processing approximately 25 MBPD of butane into nearly 1 billion pounds per year of isobutylene. Production from the iBDH plant will enable us to optimize our methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE\u201d) and high purity isobutylene ( HPIB\u201d) assets and meet growing market demand for isobutylene.\nSteam crackers and refineries have historically been the major source of propane and butane olefins for downstream use; however, with the increased use of light-end feedstocks such as ethane, the need for on purpose\u201d olefins production has increased. Like our PDH facility, the iBDH plant will help meet market demand where traditional supplies have been reduced. The iBDH plant will increase our production of high purity and low purity isobutylene, both of which are used as feedstocks to manufacture lubricants, rubber products and fuel additives.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Ethylene Export Terminal\nIn December 2019, we placed our ethylene export terminal into limited service, with the first cargo of 25 million pounds of ethylene exported in January 2020. The terminal, which we operate, is located at our Morgan's Point facility on the Houston Ship Channel and features two docks and the capacity to load 2.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year. A refrigerated storage tank for 66 million pounds of ethylene is being constructed on-site that will allow the terminal to load ethylene up to a rate of 2.2 million pounds per hour. Full commercial operations at the terminal are expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are complete. We own a 50% member interest in Enterprise Navigator Ethylene Terminal LLC, which owns the export facility.\nOur ethylene system is being developed to serve as an open market storage and trading hub for the ethylene industry using storage capacity, connections to multiple ethylene pipelines, and high-volume export capabilities. In support of our ethylene business, we recently placed into service a high-capacity underground ethylene storage well at our Mont Belvieu complex having a storage capacity of 600 million pounds of ethylene. The storage well is connected to our Morgan's Point ethylene export terminal by a 16-mile pipeline, which was placed into service in December 2019. An additional 8 miles of ethylene pipelines extending from Morgan's Point to Bayport, Texas are under construction and expected to be completed and placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn May 2019, we announced plans to further expand our ethylene pipeline and logistics system by constructing the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas, which is a leading growth area for new ethylene crackers and related facilities. The Baymark pipeline will originate in Bayport, Texas and extend approximately 90 miles to Markham, Texas. The Baymark pipeline is supported by long-term customer commitments and is expected to begin service in the fourth quarter of 2020. We will own a 70% interest in and operate the Baymark pipeline. Customers using the Baymark pipeline will have access to our high-capacity ethylene storage well in Mont Belvieu and our export terminal at Morgan's Point.\nEnterprise Announces Final Investment Decision Regarding the Sea Port Oil Terminal\nIn July 2019, we announced the execution of long-term customer agreements with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. ( Chevron\u201d) supporting the development of our Sea Port Oil Terminal ( SPOT\u201d) in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of the Chevron agreements, we announced our final investment decision with respect to SPOT, subject to obtaining the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing our SPOT application.\nThe SPOT project consists of onshore and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30 nautical miles off the Brazoria County, Texas coast in approximately 115 feet of water. SPOT is designed to load Very Large Crude Carriers ( VLCCs\u201d) at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. We believe that SPOT's design meets or exceeds federal requirements for such facilities and, unlike existing and other proposed offshore terminals, is designed with a vapor control system to minimize emissions.\nIn December 2019, we announced the execution of a letter of intent ( LOI\u201d) with an affiliate of Enbridge Inc. ( Enbridge\u201d) to jointly develop our SPOT in the Gulf of Mexico. Under terms of the LOI, we agreed to negotiate an equity participation right agreement with Enbridge whereby, subject to SPOT receiving a deepwater port license, an affiliate of Enbridge could acquire a noncontrolling member interest in SPOT Terminal Services LLC, which owns SPOT.\nEnterprise to Build Midland-to-ECHO 4 Pipeline\nIn October 2019, we announced long-term agreements supporting construction of the Midland-to-ECHO 4\u201d pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline will connect our Midland terminal in Midland, Texas with our ECHO terminal in Houston, Texas utilizing both new construction and segments of our existing crude oil pipelines in South Texas. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline is expected to enter service during the second quarter of 2021 and have an initial transportation capacity of 450 MBPD (expandable up to 540 MBPD). When placed into service, the Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline will allow our shippers with crude oil and condensate production in both the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale to maximize the value of their contracted pipeline capacity by allowing shippers to source barrels from the Permian Basin and/or the Eagle Ford Shale. This unmatched flexibility will allow shippers and producers to dynamically match their pipeline capacity to their allocation of capital and respective production profiles between the two basins. Their production will be delivered into our integrated storage, pipeline, distribution and marine terminal system that has access to both domestic and international markets.\nThe Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline complements our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and 2 pipelines, which entered full service in the second quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, respectively, as well as our Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline, which is comprised of a 29% undivided interest in a 36-inch pipeline we are currently constructing from Midland, Texas to our ECHO terminal and further to a third-party terminal in Webster, Texas, is expected to provide 200 MBPD of transportation capacity when placed into service during the third quarter of 2020, increasing to approximately 450 MBPD during the fourth quarter of 2020. Together, these four projects (Midland-to-ECHO 1, 2, 3 and 4) comprise our Midland-to-ECHO System, which supports crude oil production growth from the Permian Basin (and Eagle Ford Shale, as applicable) by providing producers and other shippers with transportation solutions that are both cost-efficient and operationally flexible. The Midland-to-ECHO System is expected to include 6 MMBbls of storage at our Midland terminal and access to more than 45 MMBbls of storage and approximately 4 MMBPD of export capacity at partnership assets along the Texas Gulf Coast. The network connects to every refinery in the Houston, Texas City and Beaumont/Port Arthur area, which we believe represents approximately 8 MMBPD of refining capacity.\nIn January 2019, we completed the conversion of the Midland-to-Sealy segment of one of our two Seminole NGL pipelines from NGL service to crude oil service, thus creating the Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline. The pipeline originates at our Midland terminal and extends 444 miles to our Sealy terminal, with crude oil volumes arriving at Sealy transported to our ECHO terminal using the Rancho II pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which was placed into limited service in February 2019 and full service in April 2019, provides us with up to 225 MBPD of incremental crude oil transportation capacity. We retain the flexibility to convert this pipeline back to NGL service should future market conditions support the need for additional NGL transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin.\nEnterprise to Build Second Propane Dehydrogenation ( PDH\u201d) Plant\nIn September 2019, we announced the execution of long-term, fee-based contracts with affiliates of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. that support construction of our second PDH facility (referred to as PDH 2\u201d). The new plant is expected to have the capacity to consume up to 35 MBPD of propane and produce up to 1.65 billion pounds per year of PGP. PDH 2 will be located in Chambers County, Texas at our Mont Belvieu complex and is scheduled to begin service in the first quarter of 2023. Once PDH 2 is placed into service and integrated with PDH 1 and our other propylene production facilities, we will have the capability to produce 11 billion pounds of propylene per year.\nEnterprise to Expand and Extend Acadian Gas System\nIn September 2019, we announced plans to expand and extend our Acadian Gas System in order to deliver growing natural gas production from the Haynesville Shale to the liquefied natural gas ( LNG\u201d) market in South Louisiana. The expansion project will include construction of an approximately 80-mile natural gas pipeline (the Gillis Lateral\u201d) extending from near Cheneyville, Louisiana to third-party pipeline interconnects near Gillis, Louisiana, including multiple pipelines serving regional LNG export facilities. In addition to construction of the Gillis Lateral, we plan to increase the transportation capacity of the Haynesville Extension from 1.8 Bcf/d to 2.1 Bcf/d by adding horsepower at our compressor station in Mansfield, Louisiana. The Mansfield project and construction of the Gillis Lateral are supported by long-term customer contracts and are expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2021. Once the expansion project is completed, we expect that our Acadian Gas System will be able to deliver up to 2.1 Bcf/d of Haynesville Shale production into the LNG market, South Louisiana industrial complex and other pipeline interconnects that serve attractive southeastern U.S. markets.\nShin Oak NGL Pipeline Commences Operations; Altus Acquires 33% Equity Interest in Shin Oak\nThe Shin Oak NGL Pipeline ( Shin Oak\u201d) transports NGL production from the Permian Basin to our NGL fractionation and storage complex located at the Mont Belvieu hub. In February 2019, the 24-inch diameter mainline segment of Shin Oak from Orla, Texas to Mont Belvieu was placed into limited service with an initial transportation capacity of 250 MBPD. In June 2019, an additional pipeline segment, the 20-inch diameter Waha lateral, was placed into service and increased Shin Oak's transportation capacity to 350 MBPD. We completed construction of the remaining components of Shin Oak in the fourth quarter of 2019, which increased its transportation capacity to 550 MBPD.\nIn May 2018, we granted Apache Midstream LLC ( Apache\u201d) an option to acquire up to a 33% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns Shin Oak. In November 2018, Apache contributed this option to Altus Midstream Processing LP ( Altus\u201d), which is a consolidated subsidiary of Apache. In July 2019, Altus exercised the option and acquired a 33% equity interest (effective July 31, 2019) in our subsidiary that owns Shin Oak. As a result, we received a $440.7 million cash payment from Altus, which is included in contributions from noncontrolling interests as presented on our Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nExpansion Projects at EHT\nIn July 2019, we announced expansion projects at EHT that are expected to increase our loading capacity for crude oil and LPG at the terminal. With respect to crude oil, we are adding an eighth deep-water ship dock at EHT that is expected to increase our crude oil loading capacity by 840 MBPD, thereby increasing our overall nameplate crude oil loading capacity at EHT to 2.75 MMBPD, or nearly 83 MMBbls per month. The new dock is designed to accommodate a Suezmax vessel, which is the largest ship class that can navigate the Houston Ship Channel, and is scheduled to be placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWith respect to LPG, our current estimated maximum loading capacity at EHT is approximately 835 MBPD, with 175 MBPD of this loading capacity placed into service during the third quarter of 2019. The expansion project announced in July 2019 is currently expected to increase our LPG loading capacity at EHT by an additional 265 MBPD and be placed into service during the second half of 2021. When this latest expansion project is completed, EHT will have a new maximum LPG loading capacity of approximately 1.1 MMBPD, or 33 MMBbls per month.\nIn light of growing international demand for PGP, we also announced in July 2019 an expansion project at EHT that is currently expected to increase its export capability for semi- or fully-refrigerated PGP by 3,500 barrels per hour, or approximately 84 MBPD. Our current loading capacity at EHT for PGP is approximately 2,500 barrels per hour, or 60 MBPD, of semi-refrigerated product. With the addition of fully refrigerated volumes due to the expansion project, EHT will be able to co-load fully refrigerated PGP and LPG volumes onto the same vessel. This expansion project is expected to be placed into service during the second half of 2021.\nGeneral Outlook for 2020\nWe provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are contingent on the supply of, and demand for the energy commodities we handle across our integrated midstream energy asset network. The following information presents our views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals going into 2020.\nSupply Side Observations\nThe upstream energy industry, led by the efforts of major oil companies, continues to shift resources to shale supply basins. Domestic shale resources continue to play a key role in both U.S. and global markets, further supporting that the U.S. is a major oil supplier on par with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) and Russia. The U.S. became a net natural gas exporter on an annual basis in 2017, and it continued to export more natural gas than it imported in both 2018 and 2019. We believe that a significant portion of the expected growth in U.S. crude oil, natural gas and NGL production in 2020 will be destined for export markets.\nAs measured by New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d), WTI oil prices started 2019 at $45.41 per barrel but rapidly increased to $66.30 per barrel on April 23, 2019 as OPEC and Russia maintained their supply cuts and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Iran, which restricted crude oil exports from that country to a minimum. However, prices subsequently softened as a result of continued trade disputes between the U.S. and other countries, with China in particular. Counteracting these trade headwinds\u201d was the fact that crude oil production growth in the U.S. was slowing in response to producers cutting back on drilling activities in an effort to preserve cash and enhance their financial condition in a capital-constrained environment. Consequently, WTI prices fluctuated between $51 and $66 per barrel for the rest of 2019. The WTI oil price finished 2019 at $61.06 per barrel and averaged $57.03 per barrel for all of 2019 compared to an average of $64.77 per barrel for 2018. WTI prices in 2020 have ranged from a high of $63.27 per barrel to a low of $49.57 per barrel through February 10, 2020. The forward commodity markets for WTI (as reported by the NYMEX) currently indicate monthly pricing in the range of $51.17 to $52.11 per barrel for periods extending through February 2021.\nAs reported by the EIA, U.S. crude oil production, having finished 2018 at 12 MMBPD, spent the first seven months of 2019 between 11.7 MMBPD and 12.1 MMBPD. Nevertheless, U.S. crude oil production accelerated during the latter part of the year at a record high of 12.9 MMBPD in November 2019. In addition, as reported by the EIA, U.S. production of NGLs increased steadily throughout 2019 and averaged a record 4.8 MMBPD for the year. For 2018, U.S. production of NGLs averaged 4.4 MMBPD. The focus of U.S. exploration and production companies in 2019 was more on exercising capital discipline than increasing production. Rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) reflect this emphasis, declining 26% over the course of 2019 from 1,083 in December 2018 to 805 in December 2019. However, not all regions slowed equally. The Permian Basin rig count fell 17% while the Haynesville Shale rig count fell 6%, whereas the Cana Woodford rig count fell 64%. As rig counts declined and fewer wells were drilled in 2019, producers gradually began to work off their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells ( DUCs\u201d). As reported by the EIA, the DUC count declined to approximately 7,600 in November 2019 from 8,000 in December 2018. Of the current DUCs, approximately 3,600 are in the Permian Basin. DUCs represent a significant potential volume that will continue to be brought into production.\nNear-term global economic growth has been adversely impacted by the emergence of the coronavirus, officially designated as Covid-19, in China, and then in several other countries and regions including the U.S., Japan and Europe. As a result of this public health concern, a significant amount of global commerce has been affected due to travel restrictions, quarantines, and similar measures. Analysts from S&P recently estimated that the virus could lower China's gross domestic product by approximately 1% in 2020, with a peak effect in the first quarter of 2020 before rebounding in the third quarter of 2020. Overall, economists estimate that headwinds from the virus could reduce global economic growth in 2020 by 0.2% to 0.3%, while in the U.S. first quarter of 2020 growth could be reduced by 0.2% to 0.4%. The impact of reduced hydrocarbon demand in Asia due to the virus has been felt in the price of crude oil. WTI prices have declined approximately 22% since the beginning of 2020 (as reported by the NYMEX), which we believe was largely attributable to perceived global economic weakness caused by responses to the virus. In response to the crisis, OPEC is considering production cuts to limit the potential oversupply of crude oil in global markets. We continue to monitor this situation and its potential impact on our operations.\nU.S. natural gas production increased from an average of 84 Bcf/d in 2018 to 91 Bcf/d in 2019 per the EIA. As a result, natural gas prices, as measured by the NYMEX at Henry Hub, averaged $2.53 per MMBtu in 2019 compared to an average of $3.07 per MMBtu in 2018. Henry Hub natural gas prices in 2020 have ranged from a high of $2.20 per MMBtu to a low of $1.77 per MMBtu through February 10, 2020. The decline in price is generally due to lower demand due to warmer winter weather and abundant natural gas supplies due to shale production. The forward commodity markets for Henry Hub natural gas (as reported by the NYMEX) currently indicate monthly pricing in the range of $1.85 to $2.61 per MMBtu for periods extending through March 2021, with longer term prices currently indicated at $2.20 to $3.20 per MMBtu. Assuming stable natural gas prices, we believe that U.S. natural gas production should be sufficient to meet both domestic and export demand.\nWith the continued growth in shale production, the EIA reports that the U.S. is becoming a major exporter of natural gas, with LNG exports averaging 4.6 Bcf/d in 2019 and pipeline exports to Mexico averaging 5.1 Bcf/d in 2019. With the completion of several construction projects by the end of 2020, U.S. LNG liquefaction capacity (according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC\u201d)) is expected to exceed 9 Bcf/d, which we believe will make natural gas production and prices highly sensitive to fluctuations in LNG exports. In fact, some in the industry would argue that U.S. gas prices could become more dependent on international LNG markets in contrast to being traditionally dependent on domestic demand and weather.\nWe operate in a number of major domestic supply basins, including the Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Rockies. The following information represents our general outlook for each of these key basins:\n \u2022 The Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico has experienced the largest increase in production in the country. According to the December 2019 EIA Drilling Productivity Report ( 2019 EIA Report\u201d), production in the Permian Basin was 4.7 MMBPD of crude oil and 16.3 Bcf/d of natural gas in November 2019. The basin continues to have many advantages relative to other producing regions, including up to 10 or more stacked pay zones, light sweet crude oil and significant infrastructure. With 405 drilling rigs working in the Permian Basin as of December 2019 (as reported by Baker Hughes), and major oil companies such as Exxon and Chevron focused on developing their presence in the basin, we expect production to continue to grow. \nA prime example of our commitment to Permian Basin producers is our Midland-to-ECHO System. This network supports crude oil production growth from the basin by providing producers and other shippers with transportation solutions that are both cost efficient and operationally flexible. We placed our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipelines into full commercial service during the second quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2019, respectively. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 and Midland-to-ECHO 4 projects are expected to begin service during the third quarter of 2020 and first half of 2021, respectively. When fully complete, our Midland-to-ECHO System is expected to provide us with up to 1.8 MMBPD of crude oil transportation capacity to U.S. Gulf Coast and international markets, while assuring the quality and grade of the crude oil being shipped.\nAn area of particular focus for us has been the development of midstream infrastructure serving producers in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the Permian Basin. Prior to the shale production boom, the Delaware Basin was a lightly drilled area due to a lack of conventional targets; however, with the introduction of horizontal drilling techniques and identification of stacked targets of tight rock and shales, drilling in the Delaware Basin has accelerated greatly over the past five years. These drilling targets have proven to produce not only crude oil but also condensate and NGLs, which present us with a significant number of opportunities to provide midstream services to producers. We are actively working with producers to identify those midstream infrastructure projects that best serve their needs and complement our integrated asset network.\nTwo examples of our initiatives in the Delaware Basin are the Orla and Mentone natural gas processing facilities. At our Orla processing facility, we placed two processing trains (Orla I and II) into service in 2018, and a third processing train (Orla III) was placed into service in July 2019. With three trains, the Orla facility has 900 MMcf/d of total processing capacity and allows us to extract up to 140 MBPD of mixed NGLs. Our Mentone natural gas processing facility was announced in October 2018 and its first processing train (Mentone I) entered service in December 2019. Following the completion of Mentone I, we have the capability to process up to 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 250 MBPD of NGLs from our processing facilities in the Delaware Basin. Given our investment in NGL pipeline infrastructure in the region (e.g., Shin Oak), we believe that we are well positioned to accommodate NGL production growth from these plants and third party natural gas processing facilities in the Permian Basin.\nOverall, we have a positive outlook regarding the Permian Basin and continue to evaluate projects that meet the midstream needs of producers.\n \u2022 In the Eagle Ford Shale ( Eagle Ford\u201d), crude oil and natural gas production for 2019 was essentially the same as that for 2018. According to the 2019 EIA Report, production in the Eagle Ford was 1.4 MMBPD of crude oil and 6.9 Bcf/d of natural gas in November 2019. The number of drilling rigs working in the Eagle Ford (as reported by Baker Hughes) decreased from 80 at the beginning of 2019 to 67 in December 2019; however, it appears that the rig count has stabilized as we enter 2020. \nProduction acreage in the Eagle Ford continued to change ownership during 2019, which contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. ConocoPhillips, EOG and other producers continue to show strong interest in the Eagle Ford, which could result in higher volumes for our midstream network; however, until volumes for the basin exceed historical peak production, there will be excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. According to the EIA, the historical peak for Eagle Ford crude oil and natural gas production occurred in March 2015 and was 1.7 MMBPD and 7.4 Bcf/d, respectively.\nWe believe that the Eagle Ford offers producers some of the best returns on capital of any region in the country due to its proximity to major consumption and export markets along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we believe that our integrated midstream network will provide us with operating leverage as production increases.\n \u2022 With respect to the Haynesville Shale ( Haynesville\u201d), natural gas production is increasing due to higher rig counts and improved drilling efficiencies. As reported by Baker Hughes, the number of gas drilling rigs working in the Haynesville has increased from a low of 11 rigs in 2016 to an average of 52 rigs in 2019. Like the Eagle Ford, we saw several significant changes in the ownership of producing properties in 2019, which contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. According to the 2019 EIA Report, natural gas production in the Haynesville reached record levels in 2019, with production increasing to approximately 12.3 Bcf/d in November 2019. Assuming supportive natural gas prices, we believe these trends will continue. \nIn 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the Haynesville and the associated Bossier Shale plays hold a combined 304 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources, which is the second highest level in the U.S. after the Appalachia region. The Haynesville benefits from its close proximity to U.S. Gulf Coast markets where significant petrochemical plant projects and LNG export facilities are being constructed. According to the FERC, the LNG market in South Louisiana and Southeast Texas, including facilities under construction, is expected to reach an aggregate 15 Bcf/d of export capacity. In September 2019, we announced construction of the Gillis Lateral and Mansfield compressor station project, both of which will support continued production growth in the Haynesville.\n \u2022 In the Rocky Mountain region, rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) in the Piceance and San Juan basins and also in the Jonah field were essentially flat in 2019 when compared to 2018; however, the predominant producer in the Pinedale field suspended drilling in 2019 due to low commodity prices. As we move into 2020, we expect that Piceance, San Juan and Jonah producers will continue a modest level of conventional drilling with certain developments showing encouraging long-term trends. In the Piceance Basin, operators have drilled several horizontal wells in the Williams Fork formation and obtained permits for deeper wells in the Mancos Shale. In the San Juan Basin, operators continue to drill horizontal wells in both the crude oil and natural gas horizons of the Mancos Shale. In the Jonah field, producers saw positive results from recent horizontal well tests and plan to continue these efforts into 2020. \nProducers in the Rockies benefit from sufficient natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure, which helps the region compete with other North American regions where production takeaway capacity is constrained. We believe that our Rocky Mountain assets will continue to benefit regional producers by allowing them access to major downstream markets such as U.S. Gulf Coast and export destinations.\nDemand Side Observations\nGlobal economic growth continues to drive demand for petroleum-based products. In February 2020, the International Energy Agency ( IEA\u201d) reported that global demand for crude oil and NGLs grew by a combined 1.0 MMBPD in 2019 and expects demand to grow by approximately 0.8 MMBPD in 2020. Recent statements by the IEA and other sources suggest that the coronavirus will soften near-term global demand for hydrocarbons, particularly in Asia, in the first quarter of 2020, with a likely rebound in demand during the third quarter of 2020. In December 2019, the IEA forecast that overall long-term demand for crude oil and NGLs by the countries represented by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD\u201d) will decline by approximately 0.3 MMBPD between 2019 and 2024, while non-OECD demand would increase by 6 MMBPD over the same period. The IEA expects that petrochemicals will account for approximately 31% of the increase in long-term global demand for crude oil and NGLs over this period. As its reference case, the IEA's long-term outlook for crude oil and NGL demand points to either a plateau after 2030, or to slow growth of approximately 0.2% from 2025 to 2040.\nWe, along with a majority of forecasters, expect that long-term demand for liquid hydrocarbons such as crude oil and NGLs should not decline before the year 2040. Demand for liquid hydrocarbons is generally driven by the following sectors: airline and rail transportation, marine bunker fuel, motor fuels (gasoline and diesel) for cars, trucks and similar vehicles, industrial users, residential and commercial heating, and feedstocks in petrochemical and plastics manufacturing. Practically speaking, liquid hydrocarbons cannot be reasonably or economically replaced for each of these uses by other forms of energy in this forecast period given current technologies. Although the IEA and other forecasters project electric-powered vehicles modestly supplanting gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles in certain markets during this period, the decrease in motor fuel demand is outweighed by demand growth in other sectors for liquid hydrocarbons.\nWe continuously review third-party economic forecasts in connection with our long-term planning. In general, third party forecasts such as the IEA's are subject to a variety of assumptions including: (i) current views of leading economic forecasters and demographers with respect to assumed economic and demographic trends; (ii) improvements in energy production, delivery and consumption technologies; (iii) current laws and regulations that affect the energy sector are unchanged throughout the 2020-2050 projection period; (iv) future commodity prices and (v) reduced costs for renewables. Changes to these and other assumptions by forecasters may yield higher or lower outlooks for hydrocarbon demand and supply over the long-term.\nThe North American shale revolution\u201d has transformed the U.S. into the global, low-cost supplier of NGLs. We expect this trend to continue into 2020 and beyond supported by, among other things: (i) the ability of U.S. shale producers to reduce development costs and improve the productivity of new and existing wells, (ii) regulatory changes in various international markets such as India and China favoring the use of clean-burning fuels and low-sulfur hydrocarbons such as those found in U.S. shale oil basins and (iii) higher demand in developing economics for liquid hydrocarbons in general. As a midstream energy company, we continue to foresee a variety of long-term, demand-side opportunities from these developments, including higher demand from the U.S. petrochemical industry and increased exports of hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, LPG and crude oil) to growing international markets.\nInternational demand for U.S. ethane is expected to remain robust in 2020, as ethane from domestic shale basins offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option plus supply diversification. Our Morgan's Point Ethane Export Terminal, the largest of its kind in the world, enables us to meet this demand and has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane.\nWith respect to the U.S. petrochemical industry, abundant supplies of shale-sourced ethane provides the U.S. with one of the cheapest feedstocks available for ethylene production. The American Chemistry Council estimates that over $200 billion is being invested in domestic petrochemical plants, with most of those investments tied directly to producing ethylene from cost-advantaged U.S. ethane. Of the new domestic facilities, seven world-scale ethylene plants are currently operational and we estimate that they have a combined ethylene production capacity of 17.7 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 490 MBPD. An additional four plants are being commissioned and expected to enter service in 2020, with an estimated aggregate ethylene production capacity of 7.2 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 205 MBPD. An additional four plants are expected to enter service in the early 2020s. We anticipate that these later plants will have a combined ethylene production capacity of 7.5 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 205 MBPD. We also anticipate demand growth for ethane as a feedstock resulting from modifications (e.g., debottlenecking, furnace modifications, etc.) made to other existing domestic facilities.\nOur midstream assets are located in close proximity to virtually all domestic ethane-consuming petrochemical plants, as well as associated derivative plants that produce various polymer products from ethylene. As a result of the expected growth in U.S. ethylene production capacity, we completed and commissioned an ethylene export terminal located at Morgan's Point on the Houston Ship Channel in December 2019. The project, which is underwritten by long-term customer commitments, is expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are completed.\nTo a limited extent, global demand for the end products produced by the petrochemical and plastics sector is currently under pressure mostly due to improper plastic disposal methods, particularly the accumulation of plastic garbage in the world's oceans. This situation has resulted in calls for better collection, recycling and disposal of plastics and bans of certain single-use plastic items. Although higher recycling rates and bans of certain single-use items would effectively reduce the rate of growth in global demand for plastics, we do not believe that such actions will result in a significant long-term decline in the production of plastics (or in the use of liquid hydrocarbons as feedstocks in the production of such items).\nWith respect to long-term LPG demand, we believe that U.S. exports to Asia, particularly China and India, as well as markets in Northwest Europe and Latin America, will continue to be strong. According to EIA data available through November 2019, U.S. LPG exports increased 17% in 2019 to 1.4 MMBPD, with volumes headed to Asian markets accounting for approximately 51% of this amount. We estimate that LPG exports could reach 2.5 to 2.8 MMBPD by 2025. Our outlook for LPG exports to Asia is supported by several factors including long-term economic growth rates in Asian markets and favorable domestic policies in countries like India and Indonesia where governments are subsidizing their population's switch from wood-based fuels to LPG for domestic use as a means of reducing pollution and protecting against deforestation. The competitiveness of U.S. Gulf Coast supplies of LPG are enhanced by the recent widening of the Panama Canal in 2016. Due to our expectation of continued growth in LPG exports, we completed an expansion project at EHT in 2019 that increased our LPG loading capacity at the terminal to approximately 835 MBPD. In July 2019, we announced an additional expansion project at EHT that would increase our LPG loading capacity by an additional 265 MBPD and be placed into service during the second half of 2021.\nLastly, as U.S. crude oil production increased, these new domestic barrels continue to supplant more of the U.S.'s crude oil imports, while the remainder are exported to international markets in Central and South America, Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes are used as feedstock in their refining and petrochemical facilities. We expect U.S. refiners to continue to operate at high rates as a result of steady U.S. demand and growing exports of refined products. We believe that our marine terminals and related storage and pipeline infrastructure that handle crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals are strategically located to meet the concurrent needs of export and import customers. We have significant export capabilities, with expansion potential, on the Houston Ship Channel, Beaumont, Freeport and Texas City, Texas.\nIn July 2019, we announced long-term agreements with Chevron that support the development of SPOT in the Gulf of Mexico. SPOT is designed to load VLCCs at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. Construction of SPOT remains subject to obtaining the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing our SPOT application. SPOT would provide customers with an integrated export solution that leverages our extensive supply, storage and distribution network along the Gulf Coast, with access to approximately 6 MMBbls of crude oil supply and more than 300 MMBbls of storage based on our estimates.\nSelected Energy Commodity Price Data\nThe following table presents selected average index prices for natural gas and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods indicated:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Polymer\n</td> <td>Refinery\n</td> <td>Indicative Gas\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Natural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Normal\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Natural\n</td> <td>Grade\n</td> <td>Grade\n</td> <td>Processing\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Gas,\n</td> <td>Ethane,\n</td> <td>Propane,\n</td> <td>Butane,\n</td> <td>Isobutane,\n</td> <td>Gasoline,\n</td> <td>Propylene,\n</td> <td>Propylene,\n</td> <td>Gross Spread\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>$/MMBtu\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> <td>$/pound\n</td> <td>$/pound\n</td> <td>$/gallon\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 by quarter:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1st Quarter\n</td> <td>$3.01\n</td> <td>$0.25\n</td> <td>$0.85\n</td> <td>$0.96\n</td> <td>$1.00\n</td> <td>$1.41\n</td> <td>$0.53\n</td> <td>$0.33\n</td> <td>$0.40\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2nd Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.80\n</td> <td>$0.29\n</td> <td>$0.87\n</td> <td>$1.00\n</td> <td>$1.20\n</td> <td>$1.53\n</td> <td>$0.52\n</td> <td>$0.37\n</td> <td>$0.47\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3rd Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.91\n</td> <td>$0.43\n</td> <td>$0.99\n</td> <td>$1.21\n</td> <td>$1.25\n</td> <td>$1.54\n</td> <td>$0.60\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> <td>$0.58\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4th Quarter\n</td> <td>$3.65\n</td> <td>$0.35\n</td> <td>$0.79\n</td> <td>$0.91\n</td> <td>$0.94\n</td> <td>$1.22\n</td> <td>$0.51\n</td> <td>$0.35\n</td> <td>$0.34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 Averages\n</td> <td>$3.09\n</td> <td>$0.33\n</td> <td>$0.88\n</td> <td>$1.02\n</td> <td>$1.10\n</td> <td>$1.43\n</td> <td>$0.54\n</td> <td>$0.38\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 by quarter:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1st Quarter\n</td> <td>$3.15\n</td> <td>$0.30\n</td> <td>$0.67\n</td> <td>$0.82\n</td> <td>$0.85\n</td> <td>$1.16\n</td> <td>$0.38\n</td> <td>$0.24\n</td> <td>$0.31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2nd Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.64\n</td> <td>$0.21\n</td> <td>$0.55\n</td> <td>$0.63\n</td> <td>$0.65\n</td> <td>$1.21\n</td> <td>$0.37\n</td> <td>$0.24\n</td> <td>$0.25\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3rd Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.23\n</td> <td>$0.17\n</td> <td>$0.44\n</td> <td>$0.51\n</td> <td>$0.66\n</td> <td>$1.06\n</td> <td>$0.38\n</td> <td>$0.23\n</td> <td>$0.21\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4th Quarter\n</td> <td>$2.50\n</td> <td>$0.19\n</td> <td>$0.50\n</td> <td>$0.68\n</td> <td>$0.82\n</td> <td>$1.20\n</td> <td>$0.35\n</td> <td>$0.21\n</td> <td>$0.25\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 Averages\n</td> <td>$2.63\n</td> <td>$0.22\n</td> <td>$0.54\n</td> <td>$0.66\n</td> <td>$0.75\n</td> <td>$1.16\n</td> <td>$0.37\n</td> <td>$0.23\n</td> <td>$0.26\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub Inside FERC commercial index prices as reported by Platts, which is a division of McGraw Hill Financial, Inc.

Refinery grade propylene prices represent weighted-average spot prices for such product as reported by IHS Chemical. (4) The Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread\u201d represents a generic estimate of the gross economic benefit from extracting NGLs from natural gas production based on certain pricing assumptions. Specifically, it is the amount by which the assumed economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs at Mont Belvieu, Texas exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy in natural gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana (as presented in the table above). The indicative spread does not consider the operating costs incurred by a natural gas processing facility to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs to market. In addition, the actual gas processing spread earned at each plant is determined by regional pricing and extraction dynamics. As presented in the table above, the indicative spread assumes that a gallon of NGLs is comprised of 47% ethane, 28% propane, 9% normal butane, 6% isobutane and 10% natural gasoline. The value of an equivalent amount of energy in natural gas to one gallon of NGLs is assumed to be 8.4% of the price of a MMBtu of natural gas at Henry Hub. \nThe following table presents selected average index prices for crude oil for the periods indicated:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>WTI\n</td> <td>Midland\n</td> <td>Houston\n</td> <td>LLS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Crude Oil,\n</td> <td>Crude Oil,\n</td> <td>Crude Oil\n</td> <td>Crude Oil,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>$/barrel\n</td> <td>$/barrel\n</td> <td>$/barrel\n</td> <td>$/barrel\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 by quarter:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1st Quarter\n</td> <td>$62.87\n</td> <td>$62.51\n</td> <td>$65.47\n</td> <td> $65.79\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2nd Quarter\n</td> <td>$67.88\n</td> <td>$59.93\n</td> <td>$72.38\n</td> <td>$72.97\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3rd Quarter\n</td> <td>$69.50\n</td> <td>$55.28\n</td> <td>$73.67\n</td> <td>$74.28\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4th Quarter\n</td> <td>$58.81\n</td> <td>$53.64\n</td> <td>$66.34\n</td> <td> $66.20\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 Averages\n</td> <td>$64.77\n</td> <td>$57.84\n</td> <td>$69.47\n</td> <td>$69.81\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 by quarter:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1st Quarter\n</td> <td>$54.90\n</td> <td>$53.70\n</td> <td>$61.19\n</td> <td>$62.35\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2nd Quarter\n</td> <td>$59.81\n</td> <td>$57.62\n</td> <td>$66.47\n</td> <td>$67.07\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3rd Quarter\n</td> <td>$56.45\n</td> <td>$56.12\n</td> <td>$59.75\n</td> <td>$60.64\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4th Quarter\n</td> <td>$56.96\n</td> <td>$57.80\n</td> <td>$60.04\n</td> <td> $60.76\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 Averages\n</td> <td>$57.03\n</td> <td>$56.31\n</td> <td>$61.86\n</td> <td>$62.71\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) WTI prices are based on commercial index prices at Cushing, Oklahoma as measured by the NYMEX.

The same type of correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs.\nWe attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements.

Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products decreased a combined net $2.54 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $4.7 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which resulted in a $2.16 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased $993.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $540.7 million decrease, and lower sales prices, which resulted in an additional $452.7 million decrease. In addition, revenues from the marketing of natural gas decreased a net $336.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices.\nRevenues from midstream services for 2019 increased $121.5 million when compared to 2018. Revenues from our pipeline assets increased $250.0 million year-to-year primarily due to strong demand for transportation services in Texas. Our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and 2 pipelines accounted for a combined $206.8 million of this increase. Revenue from our Mont Belvieu storage complex increased $94.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage, throughput and other fees. In addition, revenues from our terminal assets increased $75.8 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in loading volumes at EHT. Revenues from our natural gas plants decreased a net $285.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues attributable to the equity NGLs we receive as non-cash consideration for processing services, which accounted for a $452.3 million decrease, partially offset by the addition of revenues from our recently completed Orla facility, which accounted for a $142.8 million increase. The year-to-year decline in revenues attributable to equity NGLs is primarily due to lower NGL prices in 2019 when compared to 2018.\nLargest customer information\nSubstantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base. Our largest non-affiliated customer for 2019 and 2018 was Vitol Holding B.V. and its affiliates (collectively, Vitol\u201d), which accounted for 10.1% and 7.8%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Vitol is a global energy and commodity trading company.\nOperating costs and expenses\nTotal operating costs and expenses for 2019 decreased $4.34 billion when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products decreased a combined net $2.93 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $4.81 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $1.87 billion increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased $1.37 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $924.1 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $446.9 million decrease. In addition, the cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas decreased $420.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices.\nOther operating costs and expenses for 2019 increased a net $122.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher chemical and maintenance expenses, ad valorem taxes, and employee compensation costs, which accounted for a combined $137.7 million increase. The higher costs for 2019 were partially offset by a $33.9 million charge recognized in 2018 in connection with an earnings allocation arrangement with an affiliate of Western Midstream Partners, LP ( WES\u201d) involving the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $161.3 million year-to-year primarily due to assets placed into full or limited service since 2018 (e.g., the Shin Oak and Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipelines).\nNon-cash asset impairment charges increased $82.2 million year-to-year primarily due to the $76.4 million write-off of our equity method investment in Centennial Pipeline LLC and the planned shutdown of certain natural gas processing assets in Texas and Louisiana.\nGeneral and administrative costs\nGeneral and administrative costs for 2019 increased $3.4 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher employee-related costs partially offset by lower legal costs.\nEquity in income of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2019 increased $83.0 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines.\nOperating income\nOperating income for 2019 increased $670.1 million when compared to 2018 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates.\nInterest expense\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest charged on debt principal outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,251.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,195.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest costs capitalized in connection with construction projects (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(143.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(147.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,243.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,096.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts presented for 2019 and 2018 includes $23.1 million and $29.4 million, respectively, of swaption premium income. See discussion below for information regarding an unrealized $94.9 million loss recorded in 2019 related to forward-starting interest rate swaps. (2) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (3) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Amount presented for 2018 includes $14.2 million of debt issuance costs that were written off in connection with the redemption of junior subordinated notes. \nInterest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is a key driver of interest expense, increased a net $56.2 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2019, which accounted for a $68.5 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates during 2019, which accounted for a $12.3 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2019 was $27.41 billion compared to $25.94 billion for 2018. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital investments. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations and capital investments, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Capital Investments,\u201d respectively, within this Part II, Item 7.\nIn July 2019, we sold options to be put into forward-starting swaps (referred to as swaptions\u201d) if the market rate of interest fell below the strike rate of the option upon expiration of the derivative instrument. The premium we realized upon sale of these swaptions is reflected as a $13.3 million reduction in interest expense for 2019. Due to declining interest rates, the counterparties to these swaptions exercised their right to put us into ten forward-starting swaps on September 30, 2019 having an aggregate notional value of $1.0 billion. Since the swaptions were not designated as hedging instruments and were subject to mark-to-market accounting, we incurred an unrealized, mark-to-market loss at inception of the forward-starting swaps totaling $94.9 million that is reflected as an increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. The ten forward-starting swaps resulting from the swaption exercise on September 30, 2019 were designated as hedging instruments and are subject to cash flow hedge accounting.\nChange in fair value of Liquidity Option\nWe recognize non-cash expense in connection with accretion and changes in management estimates that affect our valuation of the Liquidity Option liability. Expense attributable to changes in the fair value of the Liquidity Option increased to $119.6 million in 2019 from $56.1 million in 2018. The higher level of expense recognized in 2019 is primarily due to a decrease in the discount factor used in determining the present value of the liability since December 31, 2018. The discount rate is based on a weighted-average cost of capital, which declined over the course of 2019 due to lower U.S. interest rates.\nThe counterparty to the Liquidity Option exercised its rights under the option agreement on February 25, 2020. For additional information regarding the exercise, see Exercise of Liquidity Option\u201d under the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item 7. In addition, please refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nGain on step acquisition of unconsolidated affiliate\nWe recognized a non-cash gain of $39.4 million during 2018 related to the step acquisition of Delaware Basin Gas Processing LLC ( Delaware Processing\u201d). For information regarding this acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nIncome taxes\nOur provision for income taxes, which primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (the Texas Margin Tax\u201d), decreased $14.7 million in 2019 when compared to 2018. Our partnership is not subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, our partners are individually responsible for paying federal income tax on their share of our taxable income.\nBusiness Segment Highlights\nWe evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results.\nThe following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross operating margin by segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NGL Pipelines & Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,069.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,830.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Crude Oil Pipelines & Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,087.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,511.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural Gas Pipelines & Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,062.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>891.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Petrochemical & Refined Products Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,069.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,057.8\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total segment gross operating margin (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,289.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,291.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,265.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,325.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. \nTotal gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management's evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin.\nThe GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled Consolidated Income Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,078.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,408.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total gross operating margin\n(addition or subtraction indicated by sign):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,848.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,687.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment and related charges in operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gains attributable to asset sales in operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,265.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,325.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.\nNGL Pipelines & Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Segment gross operating margin:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,159.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,240.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL pipelines, storage and terminals\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,402.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,048.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL fractionation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>507.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>542.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,069.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,830.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selected volumetric data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL pipeline transportation volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,461\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL marine terminal volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>626\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>593\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NGL fractionation volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>945\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity NGL production (MBPD) (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee-based natural gas processing (MMcf/d) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,282\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,831\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our natural gas processing facilities. \nNatural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities\nGross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2019 decreased $80.4 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our Rockies natural gas processing facilities (Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco) decreased a combined $130.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $108.0 million decrease, and lower processing and other fees, which accounted for an additional $19.0 million decrease. On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing volumes at these plants increased 58 MMcf/d and equity NGL production volumes decreased 13 MBPD year-to-year.\nGross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $63.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $153.3 million increase, partially offset by lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $91.1 million decrease. Results from marketing strategies that optimize our transportation, storage and export assets increased a combined $80.5 million year-to-year, partially offset by lower earnings from the optimization of our plant assets, which accounted for a $10.7 million decrease. In addition, results from NGL marketing decreased $6.0 million year-to-year due to non-cash, mark-to-market activity.\nGross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing facilities decreased $17.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for an $18.3 million decrease, and lower processing volumes, which accounted for an additional $9.3 million decrease, partially offset by higher processing and deficiency fees, which accounted for a $12.0 million increase. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production from our South Texas plants decreased 121 MMcf/d and 4 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas processing facilities decreased $12.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $26.3 million decrease, partially offset by higher fee-based processing volumes, which accounted for a $9.4 million increase.

Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline and related business activities increased $146.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a $133.0 million increase in non-cash mark-to-market earnings, higher transportation volumes, which accounted for a $30.1 million increase, and lower expenses, which accounted for a $27.8 million increase, partially offset by lower average transportation fees, which accounted for a $91.5 million decrease. Expenses in 2018 for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline included a $33.9 million charge attributable to the allocation of pipeline earnings to WES upon closing of their acquisition of a 20% ownership interest in Whitethorn Pipeline Company LLC (which owns the majority of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline) in June 2018. Net to our interest, transportation volumes for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline increased 43 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which commenced operations in February 2019, was $99.9 million on transportation volumes of 197 MBPD.\nMark-to-market earnings attributable to the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline are associated with the hedging of crude oil market price differentials (basis spreads) between the Midland and Houston markets based on the pipeline's capacity available to us during the hedged periods. These hedges served to lock in a positive per barrel margin on our anticipated purchases of crude oil at Midland and subsequent anticipated sales to customers in the Houston area. The mark-to-market loss in 2018 of $44.6 million reflected an increase in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets to an average of $8.48 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $2.76 per barrel through 2020 (as of December 31, 2018). The mark-to-market gain in 2019 of $88.4 million reflected a decrease in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets since December 31, 2018 to an average of $1.81 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $1.95 per barrel through 2020. At December 31, 2019, there were a limited number of these hedges outstanding. For information regarding our commodity hedging activities, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nGross operating margin from other crude oil marketing activities increased a net $58.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins. These marketing activities benefitted from higher market price differentials for crude oil between the Permian Basin region, Cushing hub and Gulf Coast markets.\nGross operating margin from our West Texas System and equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a combined $82.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 64 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $17.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fees. Transportation volumes on the South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased 15 MBPD year-to-year.\nGross operating margin from our equity investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $75.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes, which accounted for a $47.0 million increase, and higher transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $46.5 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $27.4 million decrease. Transportation volumes on the Seaway Pipeline increased 55 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). Volumes at Seaway's Texas City and Freeport marine terminals decreased a combined 22 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest).\nLastly, gross operating margin from crude oil activities at EHT increased $83.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher net export volumes of 243 MBPD.\nNatural Gas Pipelines & Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Segment gross operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,062.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>891.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Natural gas pipeline transportation volumes (BBtus/d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,198\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,727\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for 2019 increased $171.4 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased $122.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins attributable to regional natural gas price spreads.\nGross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $46.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher capacity reservation fees. Transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System increased 124 BBtus/d.

Natural gas gathering volumes on the Permian Basin Gathering System increased 357 BBtus/d. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System decreased $18.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a 94 BBtus/d decrease in gathering volumes, which accounted for a $10.1 million decrease, and lower condensate sales, which accounted for an additional $4.8 million decrease.\nPetrochemical & Refined Products Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Segment gross operating margin:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propylene production and related activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>445.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>462.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Butane isomerization and related operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Octane enhancement and related plant operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Refined products pipelines and related activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>330.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marine transportation and other services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,069.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057.8\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selected volumetric data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propylene production volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Butane isomerization volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standalone DIB processing volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Octane additive and related plant production volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pipeline transportation volumes, primarily refined products & petrochemicals (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>739\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Refined products and petrochemical marine terminal volumes (MBPD)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>353\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPropylene production and related activities\nGross operating margin from propylene production and related marketing activities for 2019 decreased $17.5 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene splitters decreased $29.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins, which accounted for a $65.0 million decrease, lower average propylene fractionation fees, which accounted for a $13.3 million decrease, and lower propylene production volumes, which accounted for an additional $11.2 million decrease, partially offset by higher propylene sales volumes, which accounted for a $59.2 million increase. Propylene production volumes from our splitter units decreased 4 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our PDH 1 facility, which was placed into service in April 2018, increased $14.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher propylene and associated by-product sales volumes. Plant production for PDH 1, which includes by-products, increased 2 MBPD year-to-year.\nButane isomerization and related operations\nGross operating margin from butane isomerization and deisobutanizer ( DIB\u201d) operations for 2019 decreased $13.5 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower average by-product sales prices, which accounted for a $9.5 million decrease, and higher operating costs, which accounted for an additional $5.3 million decrease.\nOctane enhancement and related plant operations\nGross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and HPIB plants for 2019 increased an aggregate $11.9 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $26.4 million increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $13.9 million decrease. Additionally, our iBDH facility, which completed construction and was placed into service during December 2019, had a gross operating loss of $4.8 million, primarily due to start-up costs incurred prior to being placed into service.\nRefined products pipelines and related activities\nGross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2019 increased $10.5 million when compared to 2018.\nGross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased $18.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fee revenues, which accounted for a $26.1 million increase, and higher average transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $8.9 million increase, partially offset by lower transportation volumes, which accounted for an $18.3 million decrease. Transportation volumes on the TE Products Pipeline decreased 79 MBPD primarily due to lower refined products and petrochemical product movements. Gross operating margin from refined products terminals associated with our TE Products Pipeline decreased $12.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs, which accounted for a $7.5 million decrease, and lower facility throughput fee revenues, which accounted for an additional $4.5 million decrease.\nGross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities increased $9.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for an $18.7 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for an $8.9 million decrease. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a loss of $7.2 million in 2019 compared to a $1.7 million gain in 2018.\nGross operating margin from our refined products terminal in Beaumont, Texas decreased $11.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower storage revenues, which accounted for a $7.7 million decrease, and lower terminaling volumes of 23 MBPD, which accounted for an additional $3.3 million decrease.\nMarine transportation and other services\nGross operating margin from marine transportation for 2019 increased $20.4 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher barge fees, which accounted for $31.8 million of the increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for an $11.3 million decrease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital investments and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2019, we had $4.85 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $4.52 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO's revolving credit facilities and $334.7 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\nWe may issue equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the 2019 Shelf\u201d) on file with the SEC which allows EPD and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. The 2019 Shelf replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement, which expired in May 2019.\nCommon Unit Buyback Program\nIn January 2019, we announced that the Board of Enterprise GP had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the 2019 Buyback Program\u201d), which provides EPD with an additional method to return capital to investors. The 2019 Buyback Program authorizes EPD to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and negotiated transactions. The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including (i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on investment, (iii) EPD's unit price and implied cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted financial leverage with a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of approximately 3.5 times. No time limit has been set for completion of the program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nEPD repurchased 2,909,128 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market purchases in 2019 (no repurchases were made during the third or fourth quarters of 2019). The total purchase price of these repurchases was $81.1 million, excluding commissions and fees. The repurchased units were cancelled immediately upon acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was $1.92 billion.\nAs noted previously, management announced in January 2020 its intention to use approximately 2.0% of CFFO in 2020 to repurchase EPD common units under the 2019 Buyback Program.\nExercise of Liquidity Option\nIn October 2014, we acquired approximately 65.9% of the limited partner interests of Oiltanking Partners, L.P. ( Oiltanking\u201d), all of the member interests of OTLP GP, LLC, the general partner of Oiltanking ( Oiltanking GP\u201d), and the incentive distribution rights held by Oiltanking GP from Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. ( OTA\u201d), a U.S. corporation, as the first step ( Step 1\u201d) of a two-step acquisition of Oiltanking. In February 2015, we completed the second step of this transaction consisting of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking. In order to fund the equity consideration paid in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, we issued 54,807,352 common units to OTA on October 1, 2014 in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. We also entered into a put option agreement (the Liquidity Option Agreement\u201d or Liquidity Option\u201d) with OTA and Marquard & Bahls AG ( M&B\u201d), a German corporation and the ultimate parent company of OTA, in connection with Step 1. Under the Liquidity Option Agreement, EPD granted M&B the option to sell to the partnership 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OTA at any time within a 90-day period commencing on February 1, 2020. On February 25, 2020, the partnership received notice from M&B of M&B's election to exercise its Liquidity Option right.\nThe Liquidity Option Agreement permits M&B to allow deferred tax liabilities to remain with OTA, including tax liabilities existing at the time of the sale of Oiltanking to us in 2014, and for M&B to directly receive EPD common units upon settlement of the Liquidity Option exercise that are unencumbered by any such liabilities. As a result, the liquidity of M&B is enhanced following exercise and settlement of the option, when compared to its financial position prior thereto (hence the name Liquidity Option\u201d). Under the terms of the Liquidity Option Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid by EPD for OTA's capital stock at settlement will equal the volume-weighted sales price of EPD common units for the 10-trading day period immediately preceding the exercise notice date, multiplied by the 54,807,352 EPD common units owned by OTA. The consideration paid by the partnership may be in the form of newly issued EPD common units, cash or any mix thereof, as determined solely by EPD. Settlement of the option exercise transaction is expected to occur on March 5, 2020. The partnership currently expects that it will elect to deliver to M&B (or its designated affiliate) 54,807,352 newly issued EPD common units (in lieu of any cash) in connection with such settlement.\nThe acquisition of OTA upon settlement of the Liquidity Option will be accounted for as the purchase of treasury units and the assumption of related deferred income taxes. Assuming that we issue only EPD common units to M&B as consideration (in lieu of any cash consideration), the number of EPD common units outstanding would not increase as the 54,807,352 newly issued units would be offset by the 54,807,352 EPD common units held by OTA that are reclassified to treasury units.\nFor additional information regarding the Liquidity Option and the effects of the option exercise, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nConsolidated Debt\nThe following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2019 for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Scheduled Maturities of Debt\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2024\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Principal amount of senior and junior debt obligations at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,878.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,982.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,325.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,400.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,250.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,071.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIssuance of $3.0 Billion of Senior Notes in January 2020\nIn January 2020, EPO issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2030 ( Senior Notes AAA\u201d), (ii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2051 ( Senior Notes BBB\u201d) and (iii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2060 ( Senior Notes CCC\u201d).

Senior Notes CCC were issued at 99.360% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 3.95% per year. EPD has guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.\nIssuance of $2.5 Billion of Senior Notes in July 2019\nIn July 2019, EPO issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due July 2029 ( Senior Notes YY\u201d) and $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2050 ( Senior Notes ZZ\u201d). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the repayment of debt and for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments.\nSenior Notes YY were issued at 99.955% of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 3.125% per year. Senior Notes ZZ were issued at 99.792% of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.20% per year. EPD has guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.\nAmendment to Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn September 2019, EPO entered into an amendment (the First Amendment\u201d) to its revolving credit agreement dated September 13, 2017 (the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d). The First Amendment reduces the borrowing capacity under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement from $4.0 billion to $3.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $500 million to $4.0 billion at EPO's election provided certain conditions are met) and extends the maturity date to September 10, 2024, although the maturity date may be extended further at EPO's request by up to two years, with the consent of required lenders as set forth under the credit agreement. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general company purposes. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.\nRenewal of 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn September 2019, EPO entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement that replaced its prior 364-day credit facility. The new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2020. Under the terms of the new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO's election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of up to 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as non-revolving term loans for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2021. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general company purposes. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.\nFor additional information regarding our debt agreements, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.\nCredit Ratings\nAt February 28, 2020, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO's long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor's, Baa1 from Moody's and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO's short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor's, P-2 from Moody's and from Fitch Ratings. EPO's credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies.\nIssuance of Common Units\nThe following table summarizes the issuance of new common units in connection with our distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) and employee unit purchase plan ( EUPP\u201d) for the years indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown):\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCommon\nUnits Issued\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Cash\nProceeds\nReceived\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,861,951\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common units issued in connection with DRIP and EUPP (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,897,990\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The decrease in net cash proceeds from the DRIP and EUPP between 2018 and 2019 is primarily due to (i) lower reinvestments by privately held affiliates of EPCO in 2019, (ii) lower levels of reinvestment by participants due to a reduction in the DRIP discount from 2.5% to 0% beginning with the distribution paid in February 2019 and (iii) the election to satisfy delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP using common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, beginning with the distribution paid in August 2019. \nNet cash proceeds from the issuance of new common units for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO's commercial paper program and for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments.\nDRIP and EUPP\nEPD has registration statements on file with the SEC in connection with its DRIP and EUPP.\nThe DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional common units at a discount ranging from 0% to 5%. Beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017 and paid in February 2018, the DRIP discount was reduced from 5% to 2.5%. Likewise, beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2018 and paid in February 2019, the DRIP discount was reduced from 2.5% to 0%. The EUPP provides employees of EPCO a voluntary means by which they can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions.\nWe have the sole discretion to determine whether common units purchased under the DRIP and EUPP will come from our authorized but unissued common units or from common units purchased on the open market by the plan's administrator. In July 2019, EPD announced that, beginning with the quarterly distribution payment paid in August 2019, it would use common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP. This election is subject to change in future quarters depending on the partnership's need for equity capital.\nThe preceding table shows the number of new common units issued to participants in the DRIP and EUPP during the two years ended December 31, 2019. A total of 2,801,196 additional common units were purchased on the open market in 2019 and delivered to participants in connection with the DRIP and EUPP. Other than amounts attributable to the plan discount available to all participants in the EUPP, the funds used to effect the open market purchases were sourced entirely from the DRIP and EUPP participants. No other partnership funds were used to satisfy these delivery obligations. We used open market purchases to fully satisfy DRIP and EUPP investments in connection with the distribution paid on February 12, 2020. After taking into account the number of common units delivered to participants under the DRIP and EUPP through December 31, 2019, we have the capacity to deliver an additional 56,320,229 and 4,596,585 common units, respectively, under these plans.\nATM Program\nWe have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $2.54 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings in connection with our ATM program. Pursuant to this program, we may sell common units from time-to-time under an equity distribution agreement between EPD and certain broker-dealers by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. After taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through December 31, 2019, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $2.54 billion. We did not issue any common units under the ATM program during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nFor additional information regarding our consolidated equity, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nCash Flow Statement Highlights\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,520.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,126.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,575.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,281.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,945.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,504.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels.\nWe may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from independent and major integrated oil and gas companies and other pipelines and wholesalers. These concentrations may affect our overall credit risk in that these energy industry customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.\nThe following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts:\nOperating activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities in 2019 increased a net $394.2 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $779.2 million year-to-year increase resulting from higher partnership earnings in 2019 when compared to 2018 (determined by adjusting our $448.6 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and \n \u2022 an $88.6 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to investments in crude oil pipeline businesses; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $473.6 million year-to-year decrease primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations. \nFor information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see Results of Operations\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2019 increased a net $293.9 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $308.5 million year-to-year increase in expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment (see Capital Investments\u201d within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information); and \n \u2022 a $140.6 million year-to-year decrease in proceeds from asset sales primarily due to the sale of our former Red River System in October 2018 for $134.9 million; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $150.6 million year-to-year decrease in net cash used for business combinations. We acquired a 50% equity interest in Delaware Processing in March 2018 for $150.6 million. \nFinancing activities\nCash used in financing activities in 2019 increased $440.2 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $456.2 million year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units in connection with the DRIP and EUPP. As noted previously, EPD announced in July 2019 that, beginning with the quarterly distribution payment paid in August 2019, it would use common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP. Prior to this change, EPD issued an aggregate 2,897,990 common units, which generated $82.2 million of net cash proceeds, in connection with the DRIP and EUPP in 2019. This compares to an aggregate 19,861,951 common units, which generated $538.4 million of net cash proceeds, issued under these plans in 2018; \n \u2022 a net $175.5 million year-to-year decrease in net cash inflows from debt. During 2019, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the repayment or repurchase of $1.52 billion principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes. During 2018, we issued $5.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes, partially offset by the repayment of $2.3 billion in principal amount of such notes. In addition, net issuances of short term notes under EPO's commercial paper program were $481.8 million in 2019 compared to net repayments of $1.75 billion in 2018; \n \u2022 a $112.9 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners primarily due to an increase in the quarterly cash distribution rate per unit; and \n \u2022 a $50.3 million year-to-year increase in cash used to acquire common units under our buyback programs; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $394.7 million year-to-year increase in cash contributions from noncontrolling interests. In July 2019, Altus acquired a 33% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns Shin Oak for $440.7 million. In June 2019, an affiliate of American Midstream, LP acquired a 25% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns the Pascagoula natural gas processing facility for $36.0 million in cash. In June 2018, WES acquired a 20% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns a majority of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline for $189.6 million in cash. In addition, cash contributions from noncontrolling interests in connection with the construction of our ethylene export facility increased $43.5 million year-to-year. \nNon-GAAP Cash Flow Measures\nDistributable Cash Flow\nOur partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets.\nIn January 2020, the Board declared a cash distribution of $0.4450 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, our management announced plans to recommend to the Board additional quarterly cash distribution increases of $0.0025 per unit with respect to each of the four quarters of 2020. For additional information regarding our expected distribution growth rate, see Significant Recent Developments\u201d within this Item 7.\nWe measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow ( DCF\u201d), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our distribution coverage ratio was approximately 1.7 times when compared to the sum of our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to fiscal 2019. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nBased on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike several other master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests.\nOur use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see Cash Flow Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nThe following table summarizes our calculation of DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income attributable to limited partners (GAAP) (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,591.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,172.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to net income attributable to limited partners to derive DCF\n(addition or subtraction indicated by sign):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,949.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,791.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>631.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>529.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(563.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(480.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset impairment and related charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair market value of derivative instruments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of Liquidity Option\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on step acquisition of unconsolidated affiliate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sustaining capital expenditures (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(325.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(320.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subtotal DCF, before proceeds from asset sales and monetization of interest rate derivative\ninstruments accounted for as cash flow hedges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,603.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,806.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Proceeds from asset sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DCF (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,623.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,989.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash distributions paid to limited partners with respect to period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,887.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,777.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash distribution per unit declared by Enterprise GP with respect to period (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.7650\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.7250\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total DCF retained by partnership with respect to period (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,736.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,212.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Distribution coverage ratio (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.70\n</td> <td>x\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.59\n</td> <td>x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) For a discussion of the primary drivers of changes in our comparative income statement amounts, see Income Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.

(3) Sustaining capital expenditures include cash payments and accruals applicable to the period. (4) See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the years indicated. (5) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these periods was primarily reinvested in growth capital projects. This retainage of cash substantially reduced our reliance on the equity capital markets to fund such expenditures. (6) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing DCF by total cash distributions paid to limited partners and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,520.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,126.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to reconcile net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF (addition or subtraction indicated by sign):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net effect of changes in operating accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>457.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sustaining capital expenditures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(325.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(320.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributions received for return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from asset sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Monetization of interest rate derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>DCF (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,623.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,989.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow ( FCF\u201d), a non-GAAP financial measure, is a traditional cash flow metric that is widely used by a variety of investors and other participants in the financial community, as opposed to DCF, which is a cash flow measure primarily used by investors and others in evaluating master limited partnerships. In general, FCF is a measure of how much cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital investments, including expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects. By comparison, only sustaining capital expenditures are reflected in DCF.\nWe believe that FCF is important to traditional investors since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, common unit repurchases and similar matters. Since business partners fund certain capital projects of our consolidated subsidiaries, our determination of FCF reflects the amount of cash contributed from and distributed to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of FCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOur use of FCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nFCF fluctuates based on our earnings, the level of investing activities we undertake each period, and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments. The following table summarizes our calculation of FCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,520.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,126.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to net cash flows provided by operating activities to derive FCF\n(addition or subtraction indicated by sign):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,575.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,281.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash contributions from noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>632.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash distributions paid to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FCF (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,471.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,001.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe elements used in calculating FCF are sourced directly from our statements of consolidated cash flows presented under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For a discussion of significant year-to-year changes in our cash flow statement amounts, see Cash Flow Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nCapital Investments\nAn important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations, asset acquisitions, and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and other domestic shale plays. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions.\nWe placed $5.4 billion of major growth capital projects into service during 2019, including Shin Oak, Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, iBDH facility, Mentone I, Bulldog natural gas plant at our Carthage processing facility, expansion of LPG loading capacity at EHT, and our Morgan's Point ethylene export terminal. At February 1, 2020, we had $7.7 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023 including the following major projects:\n \u2022 two NGL fractionators in Chambers County, Texas ( Frac X,\u201d first quarter of 2020; Frac XI,\u201d third quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 expansion of our Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline (second quarter of 2020): \n \u2022 the Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline (third through fourth quarters of 2020), \n \u2022 expansion of our natural gas pipelines in northeast Texas in support of our Carthage natural gas processing facility (third quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 completion of the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas (fourth quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 an eighth deep-water ship dock at EHT for loading crude oil (fourth quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 expansion of our ethylene export capabilities at Morgan's Point (fourth quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 our Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline (second quarter of 2021), \n \u2022 expansion of our LPG and PGP export capabilities at EHT (second half of 2021), \n \u2022 expansion and extension of Acadian Gas System (Gillis Lateral and related projects) (third quarter of 2021), \n \u2022 addition of incremental capacity at our isomerization facility (first quarter of 2022), \n \u2022 construction of our PDH 2 facility (first quarter of 2023). \nBased on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2020 to approximate $3.4 billion to $4.4 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion and approximately $400 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For 2021, we anticipate our total capital investments in growth capital projects to approximate $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. Our forecast of capital investments for 2020 and 2021 is based on announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change due to decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities.\nOur success in raising capital, including partnering with other companies to share project costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions.\nThe following table summarizes our capital investments for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital investments for property, plant and equipment: (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Growth capital projects (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,208.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,902.3\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sustaining capital projects (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>323.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,531.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,223.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash used for business combinations, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investments in unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. \nFluctuations in our investments in growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in expenditures for major expansion projects. Our most significant growth capital investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 involve projects at our Mont Belvieu complex, crude oil pipelines in Texas and expansion projects involving our Gulf Coast export terminals. Fluctuations in investments in sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects.\nInvestments in growth capital projects at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $623.5 million year-to-year primarily due to construction activities surrounding Frac X and Frac XI, which accounted for a combined $479.0 million increase, our iBDH facility, which accounted for a $115.1 million increase, and expansion projects involving our DIBs, which accounted for an additional $87.2 million increase, partially offset by lower expenditures attributable to PDH 1 and Frac IX, which accounted for a combined $185.3 million decrease. PDH 1 and Frac IX were both placed into service during the second quarter of 2018. We placed our iBDH facility into service in December 2019.\nInvestments in growth capital projects related to our ethylene business (e.g., pipelines, storage facilities and export terminal) increased $207.4 million year-to-year.\nInvestments in growth capital projects in support of Permian Basin production decreased $532.1 million year-to-year primarily due to completion of Shin Oak, which accounted for a $524.4 million decrease, and Orla natural gas processing facility, which accounted for an additional $358.4 million decrease, partially offset by increased expenditures for the construction of Mentone I, which accounted for a $249.6 million increase. Shin Oak entered limited service in February 2019, with full capacity available in December 2019. Orla III entered service in July 2019 and Mentone I commenced operations in December 2019.\nNet cash used for business combinations during 2018 reflects our acquisition of a 50% member interest in Delaware Processing in March 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies:\nDepreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment\nIn general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset's cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $41.6 billion and $38.74 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.56 billion and $1.44 billion of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments\nLong-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable through future cash flows. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products.\nThe carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset's estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes.\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a potential loss in value of the investment attributable to an other than temporary decline. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity's industry. In the event we determine that the value of an investment is not recoverable due to an other than temporary decline, we record a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful lives of the investment's underlying assets.\nA significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time.\nIn 2019 and 2018, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets and equity method investments of $127.5 million and $46.8 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding impairment charges, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nValuation and Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets\nThe specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate.\nCustomer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities.\nIn other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals.\nThe value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin.\nContract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements.\nIf our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset's carrying value is not recoverable through its future cash flows, we would be required to reduce the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.45 billion and $3.61 billion, respectively. We recorded $174.7 million and $170.3 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nMethods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, our goodwill balance was $5.75 billion. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, we evaluate goodwill for impairment on December 31 of each year or when impairment indicators (e.g., the loss of a significant customer, adverse long-term supply or demand trends, or technological obsolescence of assets) are present.\nTesting goodwill for impairment involves a two-step process. As Step 1 of the process, if impairment indicators are present, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned is determined and compared to its carrying value. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets that comprise the reporting unit. These assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets classified within the reporting unit, which, in turn, rely on management's estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. We believe that the assumptions we use in estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their fair value estimation process. As Step 2 of the process, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including associated goodwill), a non-cash impairment charge to earnings is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d This ASU simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 for future goodwill impairment testing.\nFor additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nUse of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses\nAs noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements. Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines.\nOur most significant routine estimates involve revenues and costs of certain natural gas processing facilities, pipeline transportation revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs. These types of transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded.\nChanges in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on currently available information to determine if adjustments are required. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nOther Matters\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment or Settlement due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>In less than\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>In 1-3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>In 4-5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Scheduled maturities of debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,878.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,982.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,100.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,071.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated cash payments for interest (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,264.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,224.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,255.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,084.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,700.5\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product purchase commitments (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,574.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,798.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,274.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,228.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,273.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service payment commitments (4,5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>335.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital expenditure commitments (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other long-term liabilities (7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>860.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>738.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total contractual payment obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,230.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,162.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,517.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,551.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,999.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our current and long-term debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2019, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates. Our estimated cash payments for interest are influenced by the long-term maturities of our $2.65 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067 through February 2078). The estimated cash payments assume that (i) the junior subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their respective maturity dates and (ii) the amount of interest paid on the junior subordinated notes is based on either (a) the current fixed interest rate charged or (b) the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2019, as applicable, for each note through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents (i) land held pursuant to property leases, (ii) the lease of underground storage caverns for natural gas and NGLs, (iii) the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and (iv) office space leased from affiliates of EPCO. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2019. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2019 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital expenditures, including our share of the capital expenditures of unconsolidated affiliates. (7) Primarily represents the Liquidity Option liability, the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. We expect that the Liquidity Option will be replaced with a long-term deferred tax liability of similar amount upon exercise of the Liquidity Option. For a discussion of the Liquidity Option and the effects of the option exercise, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. \nWe are obligated to spend up to an aggregate $270 million over a ten-year period ending in 2025 on specified midstream gathering assets for certain producers utilizing our EFS Midstream System. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. As of December 31, 2019, we have spent $151 million of the $270 million commitment. Due to the uncertain timing of the remaining potential capital expenditures, we have excluded this amount from the preceding table.\nFor additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nFor information regarding recent changes in our accounting for leases, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nInsurance\nFor information regarding insurance matters, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.

You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this annual report speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by federal and state securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or any other reason.\nOverview of Business\nWe are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) under the ticker symbol EPD.\u201d We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids ( NGLs\u201d) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.\nOur integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and export and import terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases, or LPG,\u201d and ethane); crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and export and import terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, export and import terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems. Our assets currently include approximately 50,000 miles of pipelines; 260 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity.\nThe safe operation of our assets is a top priority. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. For additional information, see Environmental, Safety and Conservation\u201d within the Regulatory Matters section of Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us. We, Enterprise GP, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC are affiliates under the collective common control of the DD LLC Trustees and the EPCO Trustees. Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the ASA\u201d) or by other service providers.\nOur operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold.\nEach of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our related marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle ( non-GAAP\u201d) financial measure, for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are subject to certain significant risks. Factors that can affect the demand for our products and services include domestic and international economic conditions, the market price and demand for energy, the cost to develop natural gas and crude oil reserves in the U.S., federal and state regulation, the cost and availability of capital to energy companies to invest in upstream exploration and production activities and the credit quality of our customers. For information regarding such risks, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.\nIn addition, our business activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing a wide variety of topics, including commercial, operational, environmental and other matters. For a discussion of the principal effects of such laws and regulations on our business activities, see Regulatory Matters\u201d included under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report.\nSignificant Recent Developments\nEnterprise Provides Distribution and Buyback Guidance for 2020\nIn January 2020, management announced its plans to continue to recommend to the Board of Enterprise GP an increase of $0.0025 per unit per quarter to our cash distribution rate with respect to 2020. The anticipated rate of increase would result in distributions for 2020 (of $1.805 per unit) being 2.3% higher than those paid with respect to 2019 (of $1.765 per unit). The payment of any quarterly cash distribution is subject to Board approval and management's evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payments.\nIn addition, management announced its intention to use approximately 2.0% of net cash flow provided by operating activities, or cash flow from operations ( CFFO\u201d), in 2020 to repurchase EPD common units under the Buyback Program approved in January 2019 (the 2019 Buyback Program\u201d). For information regarding the 2019 Buyback Program, including repurchases of common units in 2019, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Common Unit Buyback Program\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Mentone Natural Gas Processing Facility\nIn December 2019, we completed the first processing train at our Mentone cryogenic natural gas processing facility ( Mentone I\u201d) and placed it into service. The Mentone facility, which is located in Loving County, Texas, has a current capacity to process 300 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract more than 40 MBPD of NGLs. Mentone and its related infrastructure further extends our presence in the Delaware Basin and provides producers access to our fully integrated midstream asset network, including our Texas Intrastate System and Shin Oak NGL Pipeline. We own and operate the Mentone facility and related infrastructure. With Mentone I in operation, we have the capability to process up to 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 250 MBPD of NGL production from our processing facilities in the Delaware Basin.\nOn a related note, we completed and placed into service a third processing train ( Orla III\u201d) at our cryogenic natural gas processing facility located near Orla, Texas in Reeves County in July 2019. The Orla facility is capable of processing up to 900 MMcf/d of natural gas and extracting up to 140 MBPD of NGLs. Like Mentone, the Orla facility and related infrastructure supports continued growth of NGL-rich natural gas production from the Delaware Basin. We own and operate the Orla facility.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Bulldog Natural Gas Processing Plant\nIn November 2019, we placed our Bulldog cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which is located near Carthage, Texas, into service. The Bulldog plant has the capability to process up to 200 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 12 MBPD of NGLs. When combined with our legacy Panola cryogenic plant, Bulldog provides us with the capacity to process up to a total of 320 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 18 MBPD of NGLs in the region. The new plant supports continued growth of natural gas production from the Cotton Valley and Haynesville formations in East Texas. In addition, the Bulldog plant complements our value chain as the mixed NGLs produced at the plant are transported on the Panola pipeline to Mont Belvieu for fractionation.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit\nIn December 2019, we completed construction and placed our isobutane dehydrogenation ( iBDH\u201d) unit into service. The facility, which is located at our Mont Belvieu complex and supported by long-term, fee-based contracts, is capable of processing approximately 25 MBPD of butane into nearly 1 billion pounds per year of isobutylene. Production from the iBDH plant will enable us to optimize our methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE\u201d) and high purity isobutylene ( HPIB\u201d) assets and meet growing market demand for isobutylene.\nSteam crackers and refineries have historically been the major source of propane and butane olefins for downstream use; however, with the increased use of light-end feedstocks such as ethane, the need for on purpose\u201d olefins production has increased. Like our PDH facility, the iBDH plant will help meet market demand where traditional supplies have been reduced. The iBDH plant will increase our production of high purity and low purity isobutylene, both of which are used as feedstocks to manufacture lubricants, rubber products and fuel additives.\nEnterprise Begins Service at Ethylene Export Terminal\nIn December 2019, we placed our ethylene export terminal into limited service, with the first cargo of 25 million pounds of ethylene exported in January 2020. The terminal, which we operate, is located at our Morgan's Point facility on the Houston Ship Channel and features two docks and the capacity to load 2.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year. A refrigerated storage tank for 66 million pounds of ethylene is being constructed on-site that will allow the terminal to load ethylene up to a rate of 2.2 million pounds per hour. Full commercial operations at the terminal are expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are complete. We own a 50% member interest in Enterprise Navigator Ethylene Terminal LLC, which owns the export facility.\nOur ethylene system is being developed to serve as an open market storage and trading hub for the ethylene industry using storage capacity, connections to multiple ethylene pipelines, and high-volume export capabilities. In support of our ethylene business, we recently placed into service a high-capacity underground ethylene storage well at our Mont Belvieu complex having a storage capacity of 600 million pounds of ethylene. The storage well is connected to our Morgan's Point ethylene export terminal by a 16-mile pipeline, which was placed into service in December 2019. An additional 8 miles of ethylene pipelines extending from Morgan's Point to Bayport, Texas are under construction and expected to be completed and placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn May 2019, we announced plans to further expand our ethylene pipeline and logistics system by constructing the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas, which is a leading growth area for new ethylene crackers and related facilities. The Baymark pipeline will originate in Bayport, Texas and extend approximately 90 miles to Markham, Texas. The Baymark pipeline is supported by long-term customer commitments and is expected to begin service in the fourth quarter of 2020. We will own a 70% interest in and operate the Baymark pipeline. Customers using the Baymark pipeline will have access to our high-capacity ethylene storage well in Mont Belvieu and our export terminal at Morgan's Point.\nEnterprise Announces Final Investment Decision Regarding the Sea Port Oil Terminal\nIn July 2019, we announced the execution of long-term customer agreements with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. ( Chevron\u201d) supporting the development of our Sea Port Oil Terminal ( SPOT\u201d) in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of the Chevron agreements, we announced our final investment decision with respect to SPOT, subject to obtaining the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing our SPOT application.\nThe SPOT project consists of onshore and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30 nautical miles off the Brazoria County, Texas coast in approximately 115 feet of water. SPOT is designed to load Very Large Crude Carriers ( VLCCs\u201d) at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. We believe that SPOT's design meets or exceeds federal requirements for such facilities and, unlike existing and other proposed offshore terminals, is designed with a vapor control system to minimize emissions.\nIn December 2019, we announced the execution of a letter of intent ( LOI\u201d) with an affiliate of Enbridge Inc. ( Enbridge\u201d) to jointly develop our SPOT in the Gulf of Mexico. Under terms of the LOI, we agreed to negotiate an equity participation right agreement with Enbridge whereby, subject to SPOT receiving a deepwater port license, an affiliate of Enbridge could acquire a noncontrolling member interest in SPOT Terminal Services LLC, which owns SPOT.\nEnterprise to Build Midland-to-ECHO 4 Pipeline\nIn October 2019, we announced long-term agreements supporting construction of the Midland-to-ECHO 4\u201d pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline will connect our Midland terminal in Midland, Texas with our ECHO terminal in Houston, Texas utilizing both new construction and segments of our existing crude oil pipelines in South Texas. The Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline is expected to enter service during the second quarter of 2021 and have an initial transportation capacity of 450 MBPD (expandable up to 540 MBPD). When placed into service, the Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline will allow our shippers with crude oil and condensate production in both the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale to maximize the value of their contracted pipeline capacity by allowing shippers to source barrels from the Permian Basin and/or the Eagle Ford Shale. This unmatched flexibility will allow shippers and producers to dynamically match their pipeline capacity to their allocation of capital and respective production profiles between the two basins. Their production will be delivered into our integrated storage, pipeline, distribution and marine terminal system that has access to both domestic and international markets.\nThe Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline complements our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and 2 pipelines, which entered full service in the second quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, respectively, as well as our Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline, which is comprised of a 29% undivided interest in a 36-inch pipeline we are currently constructing from Midland, Texas to our ECHO terminal and further to a third-party terminal in Webster, Texas, is expected to provide 200 MBPD of transportation capacity when placed into service during the third quarter of 2020, increasing to approximately 450 MBPD during the fourth quarter of 2020. Together, these four projects (Midland-to-ECHO 1, 2, 3 and 4) comprise our Midland-to-ECHO System, which supports crude oil production growth from the Permian Basin (and Eagle Ford Shale, as applicable) by providing producers and other shippers with transportation solutions that are both cost-efficient and operationally flexible. The Midland-to-ECHO System is expected to include 6 MMBbls of storage at our Midland terminal and access to more than 45 MMBbls of storage and approximately 4 MMBPD of export capacity at partnership assets along the Texas Gulf Coast. The network connects to every refinery in the Houston, Texas City and Beaumont/Port Arthur area, which we believe represents approximately 8 MMBPD of refining capacity.\nIn January 2019, we completed the conversion of the Midland-to-Sealy segment of one of our two Seminole NGL pipelines from NGL service to crude oil service, thus creating the Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline. The pipeline originates at our Midland terminal and extends 444 miles to our Sealy terminal, with crude oil volumes arriving at Sealy transported to our ECHO terminal using the Rancho II pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which was placed into limited service in February 2019 and full service in April 2019, provides us with up to 225 MBPD of incremental crude oil transportation capacity. We retain the flexibility to convert this pipeline back to NGL service should future market conditions support the need for additional NGL transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin.\nEnterprise to Build Second Propane Dehydrogenation ( PDH\u201d) Plant\nIn September 2019, we announced the execution of long-term, fee-based contracts with affiliates of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. that support construction of our second PDH facility (referred to as PDH 2\u201d). The new plant is expected to have the capacity to consume up to 35 MBPD of propane and produce up to 1.65 billion pounds per year of PGP. PDH 2 will be located in Chambers County, Texas at our Mont Belvieu complex and is scheduled to begin service in the first quarter of 2023. Once PDH 2 is placed into service and integrated with PDH 1 and our other propylene production facilities, we will have the capability to produce 11 billion pounds of propylene per year.\nEnterprise to Expand and Extend Acadian Gas System\nIn September 2019, we announced plans to expand and extend our Acadian Gas System in order to deliver growing natural gas production from the Haynesville Shale to the liquefied natural gas ( LNG\u201d) market in South Louisiana. The expansion project will include construction of an approximately 80-mile natural gas pipeline (the Gillis Lateral\u201d) extending from near Cheneyville, Louisiana to third-party pipeline interconnects near Gillis, Louisiana, including multiple pipelines serving regional LNG export facilities. In addition to construction of the Gillis Lateral, we plan to increase the transportation capacity of the Haynesville Extension from 1.8 Bcf/d to 2.1 Bcf/d by adding horsepower at our compressor station in Mansfield, Louisiana. The Mansfield project and construction of the Gillis Lateral are supported by long-term customer contracts and are expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2021. Once the expansion project is completed, we expect that our Acadian Gas System will be able to deliver up to 2.1 Bcf/d of Haynesville Shale production into the LNG market, South Louisiana industrial complex and other pipeline interconnects that serve attractive southeastern U.S. markets.\nShin Oak NGL Pipeline Commences Operations; Altus Acquires 33% Equity Interest in Shin Oak\nThe Shin Oak NGL Pipeline ( Shin Oak\u201d) transports NGL production from the Permian Basin to our NGL fractionation and storage complex located at the Mont Belvieu hub. In February 2019, the 24-inch diameter mainline segment of Shin Oak from Orla, Texas to Mont Belvieu was placed into limited service with an initial transportation capacity of 250 MBPD. In June 2019, an additional pipeline segment, the 20-inch diameter Waha lateral, was placed into service and increased Shin Oak's transportation capacity to 350 MBPD. We completed construction of the remaining components of Shin Oak in the fourth quarter of 2019, which increased its transportation capacity to 550 MBPD.\nIn May 2018, we granted Apache Midstream LLC ( Apache\u201d) an option to acquire up to a 33% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns Shin Oak. In November 2018, Apache contributed this option to Altus Midstream Processing LP ( Altus\u201d), which is a consolidated subsidiary of Apache. In July 2019, Altus exercised the option and acquired a 33% equity interest (effective July 31, 2019) in our subsidiary that owns Shin Oak. As a result, we received a $440.7 million cash payment from Altus, which is included in contributions from noncontrolling interests as presented on our Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nExpansion Projects at EHT\nIn July 2019, we announced expansion projects at EHT that are expected to increase our loading capacity for crude oil and LPG at the terminal. With respect to crude oil, we are adding an eighth deep-water ship dock at EHT that is expected to increase our crude oil loading capacity by 840 MBPD, thereby increasing our overall nameplate crude oil loading capacity at EHT to 2.75 MMBPD, or nearly 83 MMBbls per month. The new dock is designed to accommodate a Suezmax vessel, which is the largest ship class that can navigate the Houston Ship Channel, and is scheduled to be placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWith respect to LPG, our current estimated maximum loading capacity at EHT is approximately 835 MBPD, with 175 MBPD of this loading capacity placed into service during the third quarter of 2019. The expansion project announced in July 2019 is currently expected to increase our LPG loading capacity at EHT by an additional 265 MBPD and be placed into service during the second half of 2021. When this latest expansion project is completed, EHT will have a new maximum LPG loading capacity of approximately 1.1 MMBPD, or 33 MMBbls per month.\nIn light of growing international demand for PGP, we also announced in July 2019 an expansion project at EHT that is currently expected to increase its export capability for semi- or fully-refrigerated PGP by 3,500 barrels per hour, or approximately 84 MBPD. Our current loading capacity at EHT for PGP is approximately 2,500 barrels per hour, or 60 MBPD, of semi-refrigerated product. With the addition of fully refrigerated volumes due to the expansion project, EHT will be able to co-load fully refrigerated PGP and LPG volumes onto the same vessel. This expansion project is expected to be placed into service during the second half of 2021.\nGeneral Outlook for 2020\nWe provide midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are contingent on the supply of, and demand for the energy commodities we handle across our integrated midstream energy asset network. The following information presents our views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals going into 2020.\nSupply Side Observations\nThe upstream energy industry, led by the efforts of major oil companies, continues to shift resources to shale supply basins. Domestic shale resources continue to play a key role in both U.S. and global markets, further supporting that the U.S. is a major oil supplier on par with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC\u201d) and Russia. The U.S. became a net natural gas exporter on an annual basis in 2017, and it continued to export more natural gas than it imported in both 2018 and 2019. We believe that a significant portion of the expected growth in U.S. crude oil, natural gas and NGL production in 2020 will be destined for export markets.\nAs measured by New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d), WTI oil prices started 2019 at $45.41 per barrel but rapidly increased to $66.30 per barrel on April 23, 2019 as OPEC and Russia maintained their supply cuts and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Iran, which restricted crude oil exports from that country to a minimum. However, prices subsequently softened as a result of continued trade disputes between the U.S. and other countries, with China in particular. Counteracting these trade headwinds\u201d was the fact that crude oil production growth in the U.S. was slowing in response to producers cutting back on drilling activities in an effort to preserve cash and enhance their financial condition in a capital-constrained environment. Consequently, WTI prices fluctuated between $51 and $66 per barrel for the rest of 2019. The WTI oil price finished 2019 at $61.06 per barrel and averaged $57.03 per barrel for all of 2019 compared to an average of $64.77 per barrel for 2018. WTI prices in 2020 have ranged from a high of $63.27 per barrel to a low of $49.57 per barrel through February 10, 2020. The forward commodity markets for WTI (as reported by the NYMEX) currently indicate monthly pricing in the range of $51.17 to $52.11 per barrel for periods extending through February 2021.\nAs reported by the EIA, U.S. crude oil production, having finished 2018 at 12 MMBPD, spent the first seven months of 2019 between 11.7 MMBPD and 12.1 MMBPD. Nevertheless, U.S. crude oil production accelerated during the latter part of the year at a record high of 12.9 MMBPD in November 2019. In addition, as reported by the EIA, U.S. production of NGLs increased steadily throughout 2019 and averaged a record 4.8 MMBPD for the year. For 2018, U.S. production of NGLs averaged 4.4 MMBPD. The focus of U.S. exploration and production companies in 2019 was more on exercising capital discipline than increasing production. Rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) reflect this emphasis, declining 26% over the course of 2019 from 1,083 in December 2018 to 805 in December 2019. However, not all regions slowed equally. The Permian Basin rig count fell 17% while the Haynesville Shale rig count fell 6%, whereas the Cana Woodford rig count fell 64%. As rig counts declined and fewer wells were drilled in 2019, producers gradually began to work off their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells ( DUCs\u201d). As reported by the EIA, the DUC count declined to approximately 7,600 in November 2019 from 8,000 in December 2018. Of the current DUCs, approximately 3,600 are in the Permian Basin. DUCs represent a significant potential volume that will continue to be brought into production.\nNear-term global economic growth has been adversely impacted by the emergence of the coronavirus, officially designated as Covid-19, in China, and then in several other countries and regions including the U.S., Japan and Europe. As a result of this public health concern, a significant amount of global commerce has been affected due to travel restrictions, quarantines, and similar measures. Analysts from S&P recently estimated that the virus could lower China's gross domestic product by approximately 1% in 2020, with a peak effect in the first quarter of 2020 before rebounding in the third quarter of 2020. Overall, economists estimate that headwinds from the virus could reduce global economic growth in 2020 by 0.2% to 0.3%, while in the U.S. first quarter of 2020 growth could be reduced by 0.2% to 0.4%. The impact of reduced hydrocarbon demand in Asia due to the virus has been felt in the price of crude oil. WTI prices have declined approximately 22% since the beginning of 2020 (as reported by the NYMEX), which we believe was largely attributable to perceived global economic weakness caused by responses to the virus. In response to the crisis, OPEC is considering production cuts to limit the potential oversupply of crude oil in global markets. We continue to monitor this situation and its potential impact on our operations.\nU.S. natural gas production increased from an average of 84 Bcf/d in 2018 to 91 Bcf/d in 2019 per the EIA. As a result, natural gas prices, as measured by the NYMEX at Henry Hub, averaged $2.53 per MMBtu in 2019 compared to an average of $3.07 per MMBtu in 2018. Henry Hub natural gas prices in 2020 have ranged from a high of $2.20 per MMBtu to a low of $1.77 per MMBtu through February 10, 2020. The decline in price is generally due to lower demand due to warmer winter weather and abundant natural gas supplies due to shale production. The forward commodity markets for Henry Hub natural gas (as reported by the NYMEX) currently indicate monthly pricing in the range of $1.85 to $2.61 per MMBtu for periods extending through March 2021, with longer term prices currently indicated at $2.20 to $3.20 per MMBtu. Assuming stable natural gas prices, we believe that U.S. natural gas production should be sufficient to meet both domestic and export demand.\nWith the continued growth in shale production, the EIA reports that the U.S. is becoming a major exporter of natural gas, with LNG exports averaging 4.6 Bcf/d in 2019 and pipeline exports to Mexico averaging 5.1 Bcf/d in 2019. With the completion of several construction projects by the end of 2020, U.S. LNG liquefaction capacity (according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC\u201d)) is expected to exceed 9 Bcf/d, which we believe will make natural gas production and prices highly sensitive to fluctuations in LNG exports. In fact, some in the industry would argue that U.S. gas prices could become more dependent on international LNG markets in contrast to being traditionally dependent on domestic demand and weather.\nWe operate in a number of major domestic supply basins, including the Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Rockies. The following information represents our general outlook for each of these key basins:\n \u2022 The Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico has experienced the largest increase in production in the country. According to the December 2019 EIA Drilling Productivity Report ( 2019 EIA Report\u201d), production in the Permian Basin was 4.7 MMBPD of crude oil and 16.3 Bcf/d of natural gas in November 2019. The basin continues to have many advantages relative to other producing regions, including up to 10 or more stacked pay zones, light sweet crude oil and significant infrastructure. With 405 drilling rigs working in the Permian Basin as of December 2019 (as reported by Baker Hughes), and major oil companies such as Exxon and Chevron focused on developing their presence in the basin, we expect production to continue to grow. \nA prime example of our commitment to Permian Basin producers is our Midland-to-ECHO System. This network supports crude oil production growth from the basin by providing producers and other shippers with transportation solutions that are both cost efficient and operationally flexible. We placed our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipelines into full commercial service during the second quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2019, respectively. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 and Midland-to-ECHO 4 projects are expected to begin service during the third quarter of 2020 and first half of 2021, respectively. When fully complete, our Midland-to-ECHO System is expected to provide us with up to 1.8 MMBPD of crude oil transportation capacity to U.S. Gulf Coast and international markets, while assuring the quality and grade of the crude oil being shipped.\nAn area of particular focus for us has been the development of midstream infrastructure serving producers in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the Permian Basin. Prior to the shale production boom, the Delaware Basin was a lightly drilled area due to a lack of conventional targets; however, with the introduction of horizontal drilling techniques and identification of stacked targets of tight rock and shales, drilling in the Delaware Basin has accelerated greatly over the past five years. These drilling targets have proven to produce not only crude oil but also condensate and NGLs, which present us with a significant number of opportunities to provide midstream services to producers. We are actively working with producers to identify those midstream infrastructure projects that best serve their needs and complement our integrated asset network.\nTwo examples of our initiatives in the Delaware Basin are the Orla and Mentone natural gas processing facilities. At our Orla processing facility, we placed two processing trains (Orla I and II) into service in 2018, and a third processing train (Orla III) was placed into service in July 2019. With three trains, the Orla facility has 900 MMcf/d of total processing capacity and allows us to extract up to 140 MBPD of mixed NGLs. Our Mentone natural gas processing facility was announced in October 2018 and its first processing train (Mentone I) entered service in December 2019. Following the completion of Mentone I, we have the capability to process up to 1.6 Bcf/d of natural gas and extract up to 250 MBPD of NGLs from our processing facilities in the Delaware Basin. Given our investment in NGL pipeline infrastructure in the region (e.g., Shin Oak), we believe that we are well positioned to accommodate NGL production growth from these plants and third party natural gas processing facilities in the Permian Basin.\nOverall, we have a positive outlook regarding the Permian Basin and continue to evaluate projects that meet the midstream needs of producers.\n \u2022 In the Eagle Ford Shale ( Eagle Ford\u201d), crude oil and natural gas production for 2019 was essentially the same as that for 2018. According to the 2019 EIA Report, production in the Eagle Ford was 1.4 MMBPD of crude oil and 6.9 Bcf/d of natural gas in November 2019. The number of drilling rigs working in the Eagle Ford (as reported by Baker Hughes) decreased from 80 at the beginning of 2019 to 67 in December 2019; however, it appears that the rig count has stabilized as we enter 2020. \nProduction acreage in the Eagle Ford continued to change ownership during 2019, which contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. ConocoPhillips, EOG and other producers continue to show strong interest in the Eagle Ford, which could result in higher volumes for our midstream network; however, until volumes for the basin exceed historical peak production, there will be excess capacity of midstream infrastructure available in the region. According to the EIA, the historical peak for Eagle Ford crude oil and natural gas production occurred in March 2015 and was 1.7 MMBPD and 7.4 Bcf/d, respectively.\nWe believe that the Eagle Ford offers producers some of the best returns on capital of any region in the country due to its proximity to major consumption and export markets along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we believe that our integrated midstream network will provide us with operating leverage as production increases.\n \u2022 With respect to the Haynesville Shale ( Haynesville\u201d), natural gas production is increasing due to higher rig counts and improved drilling efficiencies. As reported by Baker Hughes, the number of gas drilling rigs working in the Haynesville has increased from a low of 11 rigs in 2016 to an average of 52 rigs in 2019. Like the Eagle Ford, we saw several significant changes in the ownership of producing properties in 2019, which contributed to increased drilling activity in the region by the new owners. According to the 2019 EIA Report, natural gas production in the Haynesville reached record levels in 2019, with production increasing to approximately 12.3 Bcf/d in November 2019. Assuming supportive natural gas prices, we believe these trends will continue. \nIn 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the Haynesville and the associated Bossier Shale plays hold a combined 304 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources, which is the second highest level in the U.S. after the Appalachia region. The Haynesville benefits from its close proximity to U.S. Gulf Coast markets where significant petrochemical plant projects and LNG export facilities are being constructed. According to the FERC, the LNG market in South Louisiana and Southeast Texas, including facilities under construction, is expected to reach an aggregate 15 Bcf/d of export capacity. In September 2019, we announced construction of the Gillis Lateral and Mansfield compressor station project, both of which will support continued production growth in the Haynesville.\n \u2022 In the Rocky Mountain region, rig counts (as reported by Baker Hughes) in the Piceance and San Juan basins and also in the Jonah field were essentially flat in 2019 when compared to 2018; however, the predominant producer in the Pinedale field suspended drilling in 2019 due to low commodity prices. As we move into 2020, we expect that Piceance, San Juan and Jonah producers will continue a modest level of conventional drilling with certain developments showing encouraging long-term trends. In the Piceance Basin, operators have drilled several horizontal wells in the Williams Fork formation and obtained permits for deeper wells in the Mancos Shale. In the San Juan Basin, operators continue to drill horizontal wells in both the crude oil and natural gas horizons of the Mancos Shale. In the Jonah field, producers saw positive results from recent horizontal well tests and plan to continue these efforts into 2020. \nProducers in the Rockies benefit from sufficient natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure, which helps the region compete with other North American regions where production takeaway capacity is constrained. We believe that our Rocky Mountain assets will continue to benefit regional producers by allowing them access to major downstream markets such as U.S. Gulf Coast and export destinations.\nDemand Side Observations\nGlobal economic growth continues to drive demand for petroleum-based products. In February 2020, the International Energy Agency ( IEA\u201d) reported that global demand for crude oil and NGLs grew by a combined 1.0 MMBPD in 2019 and expects demand to grow by approximately 0.8 MMBPD in 2020. Recent statements by the IEA and other sources suggest that the coronavirus will soften near-term global demand for hydrocarbons, particularly in Asia, in the first quarter of 2020, with a likely rebound in demand during the third quarter of 2020. In December 2019, the IEA forecast that overall long-term demand for crude oil and NGLs by the countries represented by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD\u201d) will decline by approximately 0.3 MMBPD between 2019 and 2024, while non-OECD demand would increase by 6 MMBPD over the same period. The IEA expects that petrochemicals will account for approximately 31% of the increase in long-term global demand for crude oil and NGLs over this period. As its reference case, the IEA's long-term outlook for crude oil and NGL demand points to either a plateau after 2030, or to slow growth of approximately 0.2% from 2025 to 2040.\nWe, along with a majority of forecasters, expect that long-term demand for liquid hydrocarbons such as crude oil and NGLs should not decline before the year 2040. Demand for liquid hydrocarbons is generally driven by the following sectors: airline and rail transportation, marine bunker fuel, motor fuels (gasoline and diesel) for cars, trucks and similar vehicles, industrial users, residential and commercial heating, and feedstocks in petrochemical and plastics manufacturing. Practically speaking, liquid hydrocarbons cannot be reasonably or economically replaced for each of these uses by other forms of energy in this forecast period given current technologies. Although the IEA and other forecasters project electric-powered vehicles modestly supplanting gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles in certain markets during this period, the decrease in motor fuel demand is outweighed by demand growth in other sectors for liquid hydrocarbons.\nWe continuously review third-party economic forecasts in connection with our long-term planning. In general, third party forecasts such as the IEA's are subject to a variety of assumptions including: (i) current views of leading economic forecasters and demographers with respect to assumed economic and demographic trends; (ii) improvements in energy production, delivery and consumption technologies; (iii) current laws and regulations that affect the energy sector are unchanged throughout the 2020-2050 projection period; (iv) future commodity prices and (v) reduced costs for renewables. Changes to these and other assumptions by forecasters may yield higher or lower outlooks for hydrocarbon demand and supply over the long-term.\nThe North American shale revolution\u201d has transformed the U.S. into the global, low-cost supplier of NGLs. We expect this trend to continue into 2020 and beyond supported by, among other things: (i) the ability of U.S. shale producers to reduce development costs and improve the productivity of new and existing wells, (ii) regulatory changes in various international markets such as India and China favoring the use of clean-burning fuels and low-sulfur hydrocarbons such as those found in U.S. shale oil basins and (iii) higher demand in developing economics for liquid hydrocarbons in general. As a midstream energy company, we continue to foresee a variety of long-term, demand-side opportunities from these developments, including higher demand from the U.S. petrochemical industry and increased exports of hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, LPG and crude oil) to growing international markets.\nInternational demand for U.S. ethane is expected to remain robust in 2020, as ethane from domestic shale basins offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option plus supply diversification. Our Morgan's Point Ethane Export Terminal, the largest of its kind in the world, enables us to meet this demand and has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane.\nWith respect to the U.S. petrochemical industry, abundant supplies of shale-sourced ethane provides the U.S. with one of the cheapest feedstocks available for ethylene production. The American Chemistry Council estimates that over $200 billion is being invested in domestic petrochemical plants, with most of those investments tied directly to producing ethylene from cost-advantaged U.S. ethane. Of the new domestic facilities, seven world-scale ethylene plants are currently operational and we estimate that they have a combined ethylene production capacity of 17.7 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 490 MBPD. An additional four plants are being commissioned and expected to enter service in 2020, with an estimated aggregate ethylene production capacity of 7.2 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 205 MBPD. An additional four plants are expected to enter service in the early 2020s. We anticipate that these later plants will have a combined ethylene production capacity of 7.5 billion pounds per year and an ethane consumption rate of approximately 205 MBPD. We also anticipate demand growth for ethane as a feedstock resulting from modifications (e.g., debottlenecking, furnace modifications, etc.) made to other existing domestic facilities.\nOur midstream assets are located in close proximity to virtually all domestic ethane-consuming petrochemical plants, as well as associated derivative plants that produce various polymer products from ethylene. As a result of the expected growth in U.S. ethylene production capacity, we completed and commissioned an ethylene export terminal located at Morgan's Point on the Houston Ship Channel in December 2019. The project, which is underwritten by long-term customer commitments, is expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2020 once certain refrigeration assets are completed.\nTo a limited extent, global demand for the end products produced by the petrochemical and plastics sector is currently under pressure mostly due to improper plastic disposal methods, particularly the accumulation of plastic garbage in the world's oceans. This situation has resulted in calls for better collection, recycling and disposal of plastics and bans of certain single-use plastic items. Although higher recycling rates and bans of certain single-use items would effectively reduce the rate of growth in global demand for plastics, we do not believe that such actions will result in a significant long-term decline in the production of plastics (or in the use of liquid hydrocarbons as feedstocks in the production of such items).\nWith respect to long-term LPG demand, we believe that U.S. exports to Asia, particularly China and India, as well as markets in Northwest Europe and Latin America, will continue to be strong. According to EIA data available through November 2019, U.S. LPG exports increased 17% in 2019 to 1.4 MMBPD, with volumes headed to Asian markets accounting for approximately 51% of this amount. We estimate that LPG exports could reach 2.5 to 2.8 MMBPD by 2025. Our outlook for LPG exports to Asia is supported by several factors including long-term economic growth rates in Asian markets and favorable domestic policies in countries like India and Indonesia where governments are subsidizing their population's switch from wood-based fuels to LPG for domestic use as a means of reducing pollution and protecting against deforestation. The competitiveness of U.S. Gulf Coast supplies of LPG are enhanced by the recent widening of the Panama Canal in 2016. Due to our expectation of continued growth in LPG exports, we completed an expansion project at EHT in 2019 that increased our LPG loading capacity at the terminal to approximately 835 MBPD. In July 2019, we announced an additional expansion project at EHT that would increase our LPG loading capacity by an additional 265 MBPD and be placed into service during the second half of 2021.\nLastly, as U.S. crude oil production increased, these new domestic barrels continue to supplant more of the U.S.'s crude oil imports, while the remainder are exported to international markets in Central and South America, Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes are used as feedstock in their refining and petrochemical facilities. We expect U.S. refiners to continue to operate at high rates as a result of steady U.S. demand and growing exports of refined products. We believe that our marine terminals and related storage and pipeline infrastructure that handle crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals are strategically located to meet the concurrent needs of export and import customers. We have significant export capabilities, with expansion potential, on the Houston Ship Channel, Beaumont, Freeport and Texas City, Texas.\nIn July 2019, we announced long-term agreements with Chevron that support the development of SPOT in the Gulf of Mexico. SPOT is designed to load VLCCs at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. Construction of SPOT remains subject to obtaining the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing our SPOT application. SPOT would provide customers with an integrated export solution that leverages our extensive supply, storage and distribution network along the Gulf Coast, with access to approximately 6 MMBbls of crude oil supply and more than 300 MMBbls of storage based on our estimates.\nSelected Energy Commodity Price Data\nThe following table presents selected average index prices for natural gas and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods indicated:\n\n (1) Natural gas prices are based on Henry-Hub Inside FERC commercial index prices as reported by Platts, which is a division of McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. (2) NGL prices for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline are based on Mont Belvieu Non-TET commercial index prices as reported by Oil Price Information Service. (3) Polymer grade propylene prices represent average contract pricing for such product as reported by IHS Chemical, a division of IHS Inc. ( IHS Chemical\u201d). Refinery grade propylene prices represent weighted-average spot prices for such product as reported by IHS Chemical. (4) The Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread\u201d represents a generic estimate of the gross economic benefit from extracting NGLs from natural gas production based on certain pricing assumptions. Specifically, it is the amount by which the assumed economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs at Mont Belvieu, Texas exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy in natural gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana (as presented in the table above). The indicative spread does not consider the operating costs incurred by a natural gas processing facility to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs to market. In addition, the actual gas processing spread earned at each plant is determined by regional pricing and extraction dynamics. As presented in the table above, the indicative spread assumes that a gallon of NGLs is comprised of 47% ethane, 28% propane, 9% normal butane, 6% isobutane and 10% natural gasoline. The value of an equivalent amount of energy in natural gas to one gallon of NGLs is assumed to be 8.4% of the price of a MMBtu of natural gas at Henry Hub. \nThe following table presents selected average index prices for crude oil for the periods indicated:\n\n (1) WTI prices are based on commercial index prices at Cushing, Oklahoma as measured by the NYMEX. (2) Midland and Houston crude oil prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Argus. (3) Light Louisiana Sweet ( LLS\u201d) prices are based on commercial index prices as reported by Platts. \nFluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices, which fluctuate for a variety of reasons including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions. The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.47 per gallon in 2019 compared to $0.70 per gallon in 2018.\nA decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower energy commodity sales prices may not result in a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also decrease due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same type of correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs.\nWe attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities.\nIncome Statement Highlights\nThe following table summarizes the key components of our consolidated results of operations for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\nRevenues\nThe following table presents each business segment's contribution to consolidated revenues for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\nTotal revenues for 2019 decreased $3.75 billion when compared to 2018 primarily due to a $3.87 billion decrease in marketing revenues. Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products decreased a combined net $2.54 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $4.7 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which resulted in a $2.16 billion increase. Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased $993.4 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $540.7 million decrease, and lower sales prices, which resulted in an additional $452.7 million decrease. In addition, revenues from the marketing of natural gas decreased a net $336.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales prices.\nRevenues from midstream services for 2019 increased $121.5 million when compared to 2018. Revenues from our pipeline assets increased $250.0 million year-to-year primarily due to strong demand for transportation services in Texas. Our Midland-to-ECHO 1 and 2 pipelines accounted for a combined $206.8 million of this increase. Revenue from our Mont Belvieu storage complex increased $94.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher storage, throughput and other fees. In addition, revenues from our terminal assets increased $75.8 million year-to-year primarily due to an increase in loading volumes at EHT. Revenues from our natural gas plants decreased a net $285.3 million year-to-year primarily due to lower revenues attributable to the equity NGLs we receive as non-cash consideration for processing services, which accounted for a $452.3 million decrease, partially offset by the addition of revenues from our recently completed Orla facility, which accounted for a $142.8 million increase. The year-to-year decline in revenues attributable to equity NGLs is primarily due to lower NGL prices in 2019 when compared to 2018.\nLargest customer information\nSubstantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base. Our largest non-affiliated customer for 2019 and 2018 was Vitol Holding B.V. and its affiliates (collectively, Vitol\u201d), which accounted for 10.1% and 7.8%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Vitol is a global energy and commodity trading company.\nOperating costs and expenses\nTotal operating costs and expenses for 2019 decreased $4.34 billion when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower cost of sales. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products decreased a combined net $2.93 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $4.81 billion decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $1.87 billion increase. The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased $1.37 billion year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $924.1 million decrease, and lower sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $446.9 million decrease. In addition, the cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas decreased $420.9 million year-to-year primarily due to lower purchase prices.\nOther operating costs and expenses for 2019 increased a net $122.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher chemical and maintenance expenses, ad valorem taxes, and employee compensation costs, which accounted for a combined $137.7 million increase. The higher costs for 2019 were partially offset by a $33.9 million charge recognized in 2018 in connection with an earnings allocation arrangement with an affiliate of Western Midstream Partners, LP ( WES\u201d) involving the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $161.3 million year-to-year primarily due to assets placed into full or limited service since 2018 (e.g., the Shin Oak and Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipelines).\nNon-cash asset impairment charges increased $82.2 million year-to-year primarily due to the $76.4 million write-off of our equity method investment in Centennial Pipeline LLC and the planned shutdown of certain natural gas processing assets in Texas and Louisiana.\nGeneral and administrative costs\nGeneral and administrative costs for 2019 increased $3.4 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher employee-related costs partially offset by lower legal costs.\nEquity in income of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2019 increased $83.0 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to increased earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines.\nOperating income\nOperating income for 2019 increased $670.1 million when compared to 2018 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates.\nInterest expense\nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Amounts presented for 2019 and 2018 includes $23.1 million and $29.4 million, respectively, of swaption premium income. See discussion below for information regarding an unrealized $94.9 million loss recorded in 2019 related to forward-starting interest rate swaps. (2) We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. (3) Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. Amount presented for 2018 includes $14.2 million of debt issuance costs that were written off in connection with the redemption of junior subordinated notes. \nInterest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is a key driver of interest expense, increased a net $56.2 million year-to-year primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during 2019, which accounted for a $68.5 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates during 2019, which accounted for a $12.3 million decrease. Our weighted-average debt principal balance for 2019 was $27.41 billion compared to $25.94 billion for 2018. In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital investments. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations and capital investments, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Capital Investments,\u201d respectively, within this Part II, Item 7.\nIn July 2019, we sold options to be put into forward-starting swaps (referred to as swaptions\u201d) if the market rate of interest fell below the strike rate of the option upon expiration of the derivative instrument. The premium we realized upon sale of these swaptions is reflected as a $13.3 million reduction in interest expense for 2019. Due to declining interest rates, the counterparties to these swaptions exercised their right to put us into ten forward-starting swaps on September 30, 2019 having an aggregate notional value of $1.0 billion. Since the swaptions were not designated as hedging instruments and were subject to mark-to-market accounting, we incurred an unrealized, mark-to-market loss at inception of the forward-starting swaps totaling $94.9 million that is reflected as an increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. The ten forward-starting swaps resulting from the swaption exercise on September 30, 2019 were designated as hedging instruments and are subject to cash flow hedge accounting.\nChange in fair value of Liquidity Option\nWe recognize non-cash expense in connection with accretion and changes in management estimates that affect our valuation of the Liquidity Option liability. Expense attributable to changes in the fair value of the Liquidity Option increased to $119.6 million in 2019 from $56.1 million in 2018. The higher level of expense recognized in 2019 is primarily due to a decrease in the discount factor used in determining the present value of the liability since December 31, 2018. The discount rate is based on a weighted-average cost of capital, which declined over the course of 2019 due to lower U.S. interest rates.\nThe counterparty to the Liquidity Option exercised its rights under the option agreement on February 25, 2020. For additional information regarding the exercise, see Exercise of Liquidity Option\u201d under the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item 7. In addition, please refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nGain on step acquisition of unconsolidated affiliate\nWe recognized a non-cash gain of $39.4 million during 2018 related to the step acquisition of Delaware Basin Gas Processing LLC ( Delaware Processing\u201d). For information regarding this acquisition, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nIncome taxes\nOur provision for income taxes, which primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (the Texas Margin Tax\u201d), decreased $14.7 million in 2019 when compared to 2018. Our partnership is not subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, our partners are individually responsible for paying federal income tax on their share of our taxable income.\nBusiness Segment Highlights\nWe evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results.\nThe following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. \nTotal gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management's evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin.\nThe GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled Consolidated Income Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7. The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\nEach of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for the partnership. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.\nNGL Pipelines & Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the NGL Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\n\n (1) Represents the NGL volumes we earn and take title to in connection with our processing activities. (2) Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our natural gas processing facilities. \nNatural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities\nGross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for 2019 decreased $80.4 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our Rockies natural gas processing facilities (Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco) decreased a combined $130.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $108.0 million decrease, and lower processing and other fees, which accounted for an additional $19.0 million decrease. On a combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing volumes at these plants increased 58 MMcf/d and equity NGL production volumes decreased 13 MBPD year-to-year.\nGross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $63.8 million year-to-year primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $153.3 million increase, partially offset by lower average sales margins, which accounted for a $91.1 million decrease. Results from marketing strategies that optimize our transportation, storage and export assets increased a combined $80.5 million year-to-year, partially offset by lower earnings from the optimization of our plant assets, which accounted for a $10.7 million decrease. In addition, results from NGL marketing decreased $6.0 million year-to-year due to non-cash, mark-to-market activity.\nGross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing facilities decreased $17.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for an $18.3 million decrease, and lower processing volumes, which accounted for an additional $9.3 million decrease, partially offset by higher processing and deficiency fees, which accounted for a $12.0 million increase. Fee-based natural gas processing volumes and equity NGL production from our South Texas plants decreased 121 MMcf/d and 4 MBPD, respectively, year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas processing facilities decreased $12.7 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a $26.3 million decrease, partially offset by higher fee-based processing volumes, which accounted for a $9.4 million increase.

Fee-based processing volumes at our Permian Basin natural gas processing facilities increased 341 MMcf/d year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes at our Orla natural gas processing facility. The first, second and third processing trains at this facility commenced operations in May 2018, October 2018 and July 2019, respectively.\nNGL pipelines, storage and terminals\nGross operating margin from our NGL pipelines, storage and terminal assets during 2019 increased $353.9 million when compared to 2018. Shin Oak contributed $112.0 million of gross operating margin in 2019 on year-to-date transportation volumes of (i) 107 MBPD of direct tariff movements (net to our interest) and (ii) 129 MBPD of offload volumes from an affiliate pipeline. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu storage facility increased $106.4 million year-to-year primarily due to higher throughput and handling fees, which accounted for an $81.0 million increase, and higher storage fees, which accounted for an additional $24.3 million increase.\nGross operating margin from LPG-related activities at EHT increased $41.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher net export volumes of 45 MBPD, which accounted for a $33.2 million increase, and lower operating costs, which accounted for an additional $7.8 million increase. Gross operating margin from our Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased $10.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes, which accounted for $7.0 million of the increase, and higher average transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $5.0 million increase. Transportation volumes on our Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased 44 MBPD primarily due to the LPG expansion at EHT that was completed during the third quarter of 2019.\nGross operating margin from our Aegis Pipeline increased $40.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 72 MBPD. Gross operating margin from our Dixie Pipeline and related terminals increased a combined $24.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 23 MBPD, which accounted for an $11.5 million increase, and lower operating costs, which accounted for an additional $10.5 million increase.\nGross operating margin from our South Louisiana NGL Pipeline System increased $11.4 million year-to-year primarily due to a 51 MBPD increase in transportation volumes. Gross operating margin from our Front Range Pipeline increased $8.9 million year-to-year primarily due to a 6 MBPD increase in transportation volumes, net to our interest.\nGross operating margin from our Appalachia-to-Texas Express, or ATEX,\u201d pipeline decreased $13.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower transportation volumes. NGL transportation volumes on ATEX decreased 10 MBPD year-to-year.\nNGL fractionation\nGross operating margin from NGL fractionation for 2019 decreased $34.4 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin at our Hobbs NGL fractionator decreased $26.4 million year-to-year primarily due to the costs of major maintenance activities completed in February 2019, which accounted for a $13.2 million decrease, lower product blending revenues, which accounted for an $8.4 million decrease, and lower fractionation volumes, which accounted for an additional $4.8 million decrease. NGL fractionation volumes at Hobbs decreased 7 MBPD year-to-year.\nGross operating margin at our South Texas NGL fractionators decreased $7.4 million year-to-year primarily due to major maintenance activities completed at our Shoup fractionator during the third quarter of 2019.

Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline and related business activities increased $146.8 million year-to-year primarily due to a $133.0 million increase in non-cash mark-to-market earnings, higher transportation volumes, which accounted for a $30.1 million increase, and lower expenses, which accounted for a $27.8 million increase, partially offset by lower average transportation fees, which accounted for a $91.5 million decrease. Expenses in 2018 for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline included a $33.9 million charge attributable to the allocation of pipeline earnings to WES upon closing of their acquisition of a 20% ownership interest in Whitethorn Pipeline Company LLC (which owns the majority of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline) in June 2018. Net to our interest, transportation volumes for the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline increased 43 MBPD year-to-year. Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which commenced operations in February 2019, was $99.9 million on transportation volumes of 197 MBPD.\nMark-to-market earnings attributable to the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline are associated with the hedging of crude oil market price differentials (basis spreads) between the Midland and Houston markets based on the pipeline's capacity available to us during the hedged periods. These hedges served to lock in a positive per barrel margin on our anticipated purchases of crude oil at Midland and subsequent anticipated sales to customers in the Houston area. The mark-to-market loss in 2018 of $44.6 million reflected an increase in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets to an average of $8.48 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $2.76 per barrel through 2020 (as of December 31, 2018). The mark-to-market gain in 2019 of $88.4 million reflected a decrease in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets since December 31, 2018 to an average of $1.81 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $1.95 per barrel through 2020. At December 31, 2019, there were a limited number of these hedges outstanding. For information regarding our commodity hedging activities, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nGross operating margin from other crude oil marketing activities increased a net $58.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins. These marketing activities benefitted from higher market price differentials for crude oil between the Permian Basin region, Cushing hub and Gulf Coast markets.\nGross operating margin from our West Texas System and equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a combined $82.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 64 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $17.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fees. Transportation volumes on the South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased 15 MBPD year-to-year.\nGross operating margin from our equity investment in the Seaway Pipeline increased $75.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes, which accounted for a $47.0 million increase, and higher transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $46.5 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for a $27.4 million decrease. Transportation volumes on the Seaway Pipeline increased 55 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest). Volumes at Seaway's Texas City and Freeport marine terminals decreased a combined 22 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest).\nLastly, gross operating margin from crude oil activities at EHT increased $83.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher net export volumes of 243 MBPD.\nNatural Gas Pipelines & Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\n\nGross operating margin from our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment for 2019 increased $171.4 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities increased $122.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins attributable to regional natural gas price spreads.\nGross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $46.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher capacity reservation fees. Transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System increased 124 BBtus/d. Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System increased $12.2 million year-to-year primarily due to a $10.4 million benefit recognized in 2019 in connection with proceeds received from a legal settlement.\nGross operating margin from our Permian Basin Gathering System increased $30.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher gathering volumes, which accounted for a $23.8 million increase, and an increase in condensate sales, which accounted for an additional $13.5 million increase, partially offset by lower deficiency fees, which accounted for a $10.5 million decrease. Natural gas gathering volumes on the Permian Basin Gathering System increased 357 BBtus/d. Gross operating margin from our San Juan Gathering System decreased $18.0 million year-to-year primarily due to a 94 BBtus/d decrease in gathering volumes, which accounted for a $10.1 million decrease, and lower condensate sales, which accounted for an additional $4.8 million decrease.\nPetrochemical & Refined Products Services\nThe following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):\n\nPropylene production and related activities\nGross operating margin from propylene production and related marketing activities for 2019 decreased $17.5 million when compared to 2018. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene splitters decreased $29.6 million year-to-year primarily due to lower sales margins, which accounted for a $65.0 million decrease, lower average propylene fractionation fees, which accounted for a $13.3 million decrease, and lower propylene production volumes, which accounted for an additional $11.2 million decrease, partially offset by higher propylene sales volumes, which accounted for a $59.2 million increase. Propylene production volumes from our splitter units decreased 4 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our PDH 1 facility, which was placed into service in April 2018, increased $14.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher propylene and associated by-product sales volumes. Plant production for PDH 1, which includes by-products, increased 2 MBPD year-to-year.\nButane isomerization and related operations\nGross operating margin from butane isomerization and deisobutanizer ( DIB\u201d) operations for 2019 decreased $13.5 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower average by-product sales prices, which accounted for a $9.5 million decrease, and higher operating costs, which accounted for an additional $5.3 million decrease.\nOctane enhancement and related plant operations\nGross operating margin from our octane enhancement facility and HPIB plants for 2019 increased an aggregate $11.9 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $26.4 million increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $13.9 million decrease. Additionally, our iBDH facility, which completed construction and was placed into service during December 2019, had a gross operating loss of $4.8 million, primarily due to start-up costs incurred prior to being placed into service.\nRefined products pipelines and related activities\nGross operating margin from refined products pipelines and related marketing activities for 2019 increased $10.5 million when compared to 2018.\nGross operating margin from our TE Products Pipeline increased $18.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fee revenues, which accounted for a $26.1 million increase, and higher average transportation fees, which accounted for an additional $8.9 million increase, partially offset by lower transportation volumes, which accounted for an $18.3 million decrease. Transportation volumes on the TE Products Pipeline decreased 79 MBPD primarily due to lower refined products and petrochemical product movements. Gross operating margin from refined products terminals associated with our TE Products Pipeline decreased $12.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher operating costs, which accounted for a $7.5 million decrease, and lower facility throughput fee revenues, which accounted for an additional $4.5 million decrease.\nGross operating margin from our refined products marketing activities increased $9.3 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for an $18.7 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for an $8.9 million decrease. Non-cash mark-to-market earnings for this business was a loss of $7.2 million in 2019 compared to a $1.7 million gain in 2018.\nGross operating margin from our refined products terminal in Beaumont, Texas decreased $11.1 million year-to-year primarily due to lower storage revenues, which accounted for a $7.7 million decrease, and lower terminaling volumes of 23 MBPD, which accounted for an additional $3.3 million decrease.\nMarine transportation and other services\nGross operating margin from marine transportation for 2019 increased $20.4 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher barge fees, which accounted for $31.8 million of the increase, partially offset by higher operating costs, which accounted for an $11.3 million decrease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital investments and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At December 31, 2019, we had $4.85 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $4.52 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO's revolving credit facilities and $334.7 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\nWe may issue equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the 2019 Shelf\u201d) on file with the SEC which allows EPD and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. The 2019 Shelf replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement, which expired in May 2019.\nCommon Unit Buyback Program\nIn January 2019, we announced that the Board of Enterprise GP had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the 2019 Buyback Program\u201d), which provides EPD with an additional method to return capital to investors. The 2019 Buyback Program authorizes EPD to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and negotiated transactions. The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including (i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on investment, (iii) EPD's unit price and implied cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted financial leverage with a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of approximately 3.5 times. No time limit has been set for completion of the program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nEPD repurchased 2,909,128 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market purchases in 2019 (no repurchases were made during the third or fourth quarters of 2019). The total purchase price of these repurchases was $81.1 million, excluding commissions and fees. The repurchased units were cancelled immediately upon acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was $1.92 billion.\nAs noted previously, management announced in January 2020 its intention to use approximately 2.0% of CFFO in 2020 to repurchase EPD common units under the 2019 Buyback Program.\nExercise of Liquidity Option\nIn October 2014, we acquired approximately 65.9% of the limited partner interests of Oiltanking Partners, L.P. ( Oiltanking\u201d), all of the member interests of OTLP GP, LLC, the general partner of Oiltanking ( Oiltanking GP\u201d), and the incentive distribution rights held by Oiltanking GP from Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. ( OTA\u201d), a U.S. corporation, as the first step ( Step 1\u201d) of a two-step acquisition of Oiltanking. In February 2015, we completed the second step of this transaction consisting of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking. In order to fund the equity consideration paid in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, we issued 54,807,352 common units to OTA on October 1, 2014 in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. We also entered into a put option agreement (the Liquidity Option Agreement\u201d or Liquidity Option\u201d) with OTA and Marquard & Bahls AG ( M&B\u201d), a German corporation and the ultimate parent company of OTA, in connection with Step 1. Under the Liquidity Option Agreement, EPD granted M&B the option to sell to the partnership 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OTA at any time within a 90-day period commencing on February 1, 2020. On February 25, 2020, the partnership received notice from M&B of M&B's election to exercise its Liquidity Option right.\nThe Liquidity Option Agreement permits M&B to allow deferred tax liabilities to remain with OTA, including tax liabilities existing at the time of the sale of Oiltanking to us in 2014, and for M&B to directly receive EPD common units upon settlement of the Liquidity Option exercise that are unencumbered by any such liabilities. As a result, the liquidity of M&B is enhanced following exercise and settlement of the option, when compared to its financial position prior thereto (hence the name Liquidity Option\u201d). Under the terms of the Liquidity Option Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid by EPD for OTA's capital stock at settlement will equal the volume-weighted sales price of EPD common units for the 10-trading day period immediately preceding the exercise notice date, multiplied by the 54,807,352 EPD common units owned by OTA. The consideration paid by the partnership may be in the form of newly issued EPD common units, cash or any mix thereof, as determined solely by EPD. Settlement of the option exercise transaction is expected to occur on March 5, 2020. The partnership currently expects that it will elect to deliver to M&B (or its designated affiliate) 54,807,352 newly issued EPD common units (in lieu of any cash) in connection with such settlement.\nThe acquisition of OTA upon settlement of the Liquidity Option will be accounted for as the purchase of treasury units and the assumption of related deferred income taxes. Assuming that we issue only EPD common units to M&B as consideration (in lieu of any cash consideration), the number of EPD common units outstanding would not increase as the 54,807,352 newly issued units would be offset by the 54,807,352 EPD common units held by OTA that are reclassified to treasury units.\nFor additional information regarding the Liquidity Option and the effects of the option exercise, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nConsolidated Debt\nThe following table presents scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2019 for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\nIssuance of $3.0 Billion of Senior Notes in January 2020\nIn January 2020, EPO issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2030 ( Senior Notes AAA\u201d), (ii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2051 ( Senior Notes BBB\u201d) and (iii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2060 ( Senior Notes CCC\u201d). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the repayment of $500 million principal amount of its Senior Notes Q that matured in January 2020, temporary repayment of amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program and for general company purposes. In addition, net proceeds from this offering will be used by EPO for the repayment of $1.0 billion principal amount of its Senior Notes Y upon their maturity in September 2020.\nSenior Notes AAA were issued at 99.921% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 2.80% per year. Senior Notes BBB were issued at 99.413% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 3.70% per year. Senior Notes CCC were issued at 99.360% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of 3.95% per year. EPD has guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.\nIssuance of $2.5 Billion of Senior Notes in July 2019\nIn July 2019, EPO issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due July 2029 ( Senior Notes YY\u201d) and $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2050 ( Senior Notes ZZ\u201d). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for the repayment of debt and for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments.\nSenior Notes YY were issued at 99.955% of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 3.125% per year. Senior Notes ZZ were issued at 99.792% of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.20% per year. EPD has guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.\nAmendment to Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn September 2019, EPO entered into an amendment (the First Amendment\u201d) to its revolving credit agreement dated September 13, 2017 (the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d). The First Amendment reduces the borrowing capacity under the Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement from $4.0 billion to $3.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $500 million to $4.0 billion at EPO's election provided certain conditions are met) and extends the maturity date to September 10, 2024, although the maturity date may be extended further at EPO's request by up to two years, with the consent of required lenders as set forth under the credit agreement. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general company purposes. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.\nRenewal of 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn September 2019, EPO entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement that replaced its prior 364-day credit facility. The new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2020. Under the terms of the new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO's election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of up to 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as non-revolving term loans for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2021. Borrowings under this revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions and general company purposes. There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.\nFor additional information regarding our debt agreements, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.\nCredit Ratings\nAt February 28, 2020, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO's long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor's, Baa1 from Moody's and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO's short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor's, P-2 from Moody's and from Fitch Ratings. EPO's credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies.\nIssuance of Common Units\nThe following table summarizes the issuance of new common units in connection with our distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) and employee unit purchase plan ( EUPP\u201d) for the years indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown):\n\n (1) The decrease in net cash proceeds from the DRIP and EUPP between 2018 and 2019 is primarily due to (i) lower reinvestments by privately held affiliates of EPCO in 2019, (ii) lower levels of reinvestment by participants due to a reduction in the DRIP discount from 2.5% to 0% beginning with the distribution paid in February 2019 and (iii) the election to satisfy delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP using common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, beginning with the distribution paid in August 2019. \nNet cash proceeds from the issuance of new common units for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under EPO's commercial paper program and for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments.\nDRIP and EUPP\nEPD has registration statements on file with the SEC in connection with its DRIP and EUPP.\nThe DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional common units at a discount ranging from 0% to 5%. Beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017 and paid in February 2018, the DRIP discount was reduced from 5% to 2.5%. Likewise, beginning with the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2018 and paid in February 2019, the DRIP discount was reduced from 2.5% to 0%. The EUPP provides employees of EPCO a voluntary means by which they can purchase our common units at a 10% discount through payroll deductions.\nWe have the sole discretion to determine whether common units purchased under the DRIP and EUPP will come from our authorized but unissued common units or from common units purchased on the open market by the plan's administrator. In July 2019, EPD announced that, beginning with the quarterly distribution payment paid in August 2019, it would use common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP. This election is subject to change in future quarters depending on the partnership's need for equity capital.\nThe preceding table shows the number of new common units issued to participants in the DRIP and EUPP during the two years ended December 31, 2019. A total of 2,801,196 additional common units were purchased on the open market in 2019 and delivered to participants in connection with the DRIP and EUPP. Other than amounts attributable to the plan discount available to all participants in the EUPP, the funds used to effect the open market purchases were sourced entirely from the DRIP and EUPP participants. No other partnership funds were used to satisfy these delivery obligations. We used open market purchases to fully satisfy DRIP and EUPP investments in connection with the distribution paid on February 12, 2020. After taking into account the number of common units delivered to participants under the DRIP and EUPP through December 31, 2019, we have the capacity to deliver an additional 56,320,229 and 4,596,585 common units, respectively, under these plans.\nATM Program\nWe have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $2.54 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings in connection with our ATM program. Pursuant to this program, we may sell common units from time-to-time under an equity distribution agreement between EPD and certain broker-dealers by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement. After taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through December 31, 2019, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $2.54 billion. We did not issue any common units under the ATM program during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nFor additional information regarding our consolidated equity, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nCash Flow Statement Highlights\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years indicated (dollars in millions). For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels.\nWe may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk. We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from independent and major integrated oil and gas companies and other pipelines and wholesalers. These concentrations may affect our overall credit risk in that these energy industry customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.\nThe following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts:\nOperating activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities in 2019 increased a net $394.2 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $779.2 million year-to-year increase resulting from higher partnership earnings in 2019 when compared to 2018 (determined by adjusting our $448.6 million year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and \n \u2022 an $88.6 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to investments in crude oil pipeline businesses; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $473.6 million year-to-year decrease primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations. \nFor information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see Results of Operations\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2019 increased a net $293.9 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $308.5 million year-to-year increase in expenditures for consolidated property, plant and equipment (see Capital Investments\u201d within this Part II, Item 7 for additional information); and \n \u2022 a $140.6 million year-to-year decrease in proceeds from asset sales primarily due to the sale of our former Red River System in October 2018 for $134.9 million; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $150.6 million year-to-year decrease in net cash used for business combinations. We acquired a 50% equity interest in Delaware Processing in March 2018 for $150.6 million. \nFinancing activities\nCash used in financing activities in 2019 increased $440.2 million when compared to 2018 primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $456.2 million year-to-year decrease in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units in connection with the DRIP and EUPP. As noted previously, EPD announced in July 2019 that, beginning with the quarterly distribution payment paid in August 2019, it would use common units purchased on the open market, rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP. Prior to this change, EPD issued an aggregate 2,897,990 common units, which generated $82.2 million of net cash proceeds, in connection with the DRIP and EUPP in 2019. This compares to an aggregate 19,861,951 common units, which generated $538.4 million of net cash proceeds, issued under these plans in 2018; \n \u2022 a net $175.5 million year-to-year decrease in net cash inflows from debt. During 2019, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the repayment or repurchase of $1.52 billion principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes. During 2018, we issued $5.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes, partially offset by the repayment of $2.3 billion in principal amount of such notes. In addition, net issuances of short term notes under EPO's commercial paper program were $481.8 million in 2019 compared to net repayments of $1.75 billion in 2018; \n \u2022 a $112.9 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners primarily due to an increase in the quarterly cash distribution rate per unit; and \n \u2022 a $50.3 million year-to-year increase in cash used to acquire common units under our buyback programs; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $394.7 million year-to-year increase in cash contributions from noncontrolling interests. In July 2019, Altus acquired a 33% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns Shin Oak for $440.7 million. In June 2019, an affiliate of American Midstream, LP acquired a 25% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns the Pascagoula natural gas processing facility for $36.0 million in cash. In June 2018, WES acquired a 20% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary that owns a majority of the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline for $189.6 million in cash. In addition, cash contributions from noncontrolling interests in connection with the construction of our ethylene export facility increased $43.5 million year-to-year. \nNon-GAAP Cash Flow Measures\nDistributable Cash Flow\nOur partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets.\nIn January 2020, the Board declared a cash distribution of $0.4450 per common unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, our management announced plans to recommend to the Board additional quarterly cash distribution increases of $0.0025 per unit with respect to each of the four quarters of 2020. For additional information regarding our expected distribution growth rate, see Significant Recent Developments\u201d within this Item 7.\nWe measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow ( DCF\u201d), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our distribution coverage ratio was approximately 1.7 times when compared to the sum of our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to fiscal 2019. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nBased on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike several other master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests.\nOur use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by operating activities, see Cash Flow Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nThe following table summarizes our calculation of DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) For a discussion of the primary drivers of changes in our comparative income statement amounts, see Income Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7. (2) Reflects both distributions received on earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and those attributable to a return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures include cash payments and accruals applicable to the period. (4) See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions declared with respect to the years indicated. (5) At the sole discretion of Enterprise GP, cash retained by the partnership with respect to each of these periods was primarily reinvested in growth capital projects. This retainage of cash substantially reduced our reliance on the equity capital markets to fund such expenditures. (6) Distribution coverage ratio is determined by dividing DCF by total cash distributions paid to limited partners and in connection with distribution equivalent rights with respect to the period. \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to DCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow ( FCF\u201d), a non-GAAP financial measure, is a traditional cash flow metric that is widely used by a variety of investors and other participants in the financial community, as opposed to DCF, which is a cash flow measure primarily used by investors and others in evaluating master limited partnerships. In general, FCF is a measure of how much cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital investments, including expenditures for growth and sustaining capital projects. By comparison, only sustaining capital expenditures are reflected in DCF.\nWe believe that FCF is important to traditional investors since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, common unit repurchases and similar matters. Since business partners fund certain capital projects of our consolidated subsidiaries, our determination of FCF reflects the amount of cash contributed from and distributed to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of FCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOur use of FCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nFCF fluctuates based on our earnings, the level of investing activities we undertake each period, and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments. The following table summarizes our calculation of FCF for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\nThe elements used in calculating FCF are sourced directly from our statements of consolidated cash flows presented under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. For a discussion of significant year-to-year changes in our cash flow statement amounts, see Cash Flow Statement Highlights\u201d within this Part II, Item 7.\nCapital Investments\nAn important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations, asset acquisitions, and investments in joint ventures. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and other domestic shale plays. Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions.\nWe placed $5.4 billion of major growth capital projects into service during 2019, including Shin Oak, Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, iBDH facility, Mentone I, Bulldog natural gas plant at our Carthage processing facility, expansion of LPG loading capacity at EHT, and our Morgan's Point ethylene export terminal. At February 1, 2020, we had $7.7 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023 including the following major projects:\n \u2022 two NGL fractionators in Chambers County, Texas ( Frac X,\u201d first quarter of 2020; Frac XI,\u201d third quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 expansion of our Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline (second quarter of 2020): \n \u2022 the Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline (third through fourth quarters of 2020), \n \u2022 expansion of our natural gas pipelines in northeast Texas in support of our Carthage natural gas processing facility (third quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 completion of the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas (fourth quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 an eighth deep-water ship dock at EHT for loading crude oil (fourth quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 expansion of our ethylene export capabilities at Morgan's Point (fourth quarter of 2020), \n \u2022 our Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline (second quarter of 2021), \n \u2022 expansion of our LPG and PGP export capabilities at EHT (second half of 2021), \n \u2022 expansion and extension of Acadian Gas System (Gillis Lateral and related projects) (third quarter of 2021), \n \u2022 addition of incremental capacity at our isomerization facility (first quarter of 2022), \n \u2022 construction of our PDH 2 facility (first quarter of 2023). \nBased on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2020 to approximate $3.4 billion to $4.4 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion and approximately $400 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For 2021, we anticipate our total capital investments in growth capital projects to approximate $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. Our forecast of capital investments for 2020 and 2021 is based on announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this annual report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change due to decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities.\nOur success in raising capital, including partnering with other companies to share project costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions.\nThe following table summarizes our capital investments for the years indicated (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. (2) Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. (3) Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. \nFluctuations in our investments in growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in expenditures for major expansion projects. Our most significant growth capital investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 involve projects at our Mont Belvieu complex, crude oil pipelines in Texas and expansion projects involving our Gulf Coast export terminals. Fluctuations in investments in sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects.\nInvestments in growth capital projects at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $623.5 million year-to-year primarily due to construction activities surrounding Frac X and Frac XI, which accounted for a combined $479.0 million increase, our iBDH facility, which accounted for a $115.1 million increase, and expansion projects involving our DIBs, which accounted for an additional $87.2 million increase, partially offset by lower expenditures attributable to PDH 1 and Frac IX, which accounted for a combined $185.3 million decrease. PDH 1 and Frac IX were both placed into service during the second quarter of 2018. We placed our iBDH facility into service in December 2019.\nInvestments in growth capital projects related to our ethylene business (e.g., pipelines, storage facilities and export terminal) increased $207.4 million year-to-year.\nInvestments in growth capital projects in support of Permian Basin production decreased $532.1 million year-to-year primarily due to completion of Shin Oak, which accounted for a $524.4 million decrease, and Orla natural gas processing facility, which accounted for an additional $358.4 million decrease, partially offset by increased expenditures for the construction of Mentone I, which accounted for a $249.6 million increase. Shin Oak entered limited service in February 2019, with full capacity available in December 2019. Orla III entered service in July 2019 and Mentone I commenced operations in December 2019.\nNet cash used for business combinations during 2018 reflects our acquisition of a 50% member interest in Delaware Processing in March 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies:\nDepreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment\nIn general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset's cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it benefits. The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively. Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $41.6 billion and $38.74 billion, respectively. We recorded $1.56 billion and $1.44 billion of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments\nLong-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable through future cash flows. Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products.\nThe carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated residual values. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset's estimated future cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or amortization. In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes.\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a potential loss in value of the investment attributable to an other than temporary decline. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity's industry. In the event we determine that the value of an investment is not recoverable due to an other than temporary decline, we record a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value. We assess the fair value of our equity method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models. Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful lives of the investment's underlying assets.\nA significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets would increase operating costs and expenses at that time.\nIn 2019 and 2018, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets and equity method investments of $127.5 million and $46.8 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For additional information regarding impairment charges, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nValuation and Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets\nThe specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate.\nCustomer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities.\nIn other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals.\nThe value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin.\nContract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements. A contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements.\nIf our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for such asset would be adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs and expenses prospectively from the date of change. If we determine that an intangible asset's carrying value is not recoverable through its future cash flows, we would be required to reduce the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value through the recording of a non-cash impairment charge. Any such write-down of the value of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was $3.45 billion and $3.61 billion, respectively. We recorded $174.7 million and $170.3 million of amortization expense attributable to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nMethods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, our goodwill balance was $5.75 billion. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Goodwill is not amortized; however, we evaluate goodwill for impairment on December 31 of each year or when impairment indicators (e.g., the loss of a significant customer, adverse long-term supply or demand trends, or technological obsolescence of assets) are present.\nTesting goodwill for impairment involves a two-step process. As Step 1 of the process, if impairment indicators are present, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned is determined and compared to its carrying value. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets that comprise the reporting unit. These assumptions include (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets classified within the reporting unit, which, in turn, rely on management's estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes and similar factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. We believe that the assumptions we use in estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their fair value estimation process. As Step 2 of the process, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including associated goodwill), a non-cash impairment charge to earnings is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d This ASU simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 for future goodwill impairment testing.\nFor additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nUse of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses\nAs noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements. Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines.\nOur most significant routine estimates involve revenues and costs of certain natural gas processing facilities, pipeline transportation revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs. These types of transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded.\nChanges in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on currently available information to determine if adjustments are required. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nOther Matters\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Represents scheduled future maturities of our current and long-term debt principal obligations. For information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2019, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates. Our estimated cash payments for interest are influenced by the long-term maturities of our $2.65 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067 through February 2078). The estimated cash payments assume that (i) the junior subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their respective maturity dates and (ii) the amount of interest paid on the junior subordinated notes is based on either (a) the current fixed interest rate charged or (b) the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2019, as applicable, for each note through the respective maturity date. (3) Primarily represents (i) land held pursuant to property leases, (ii) the lease of underground storage caverns for natural gas and NGLs, (iii) the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and (iv) office space leased from affiliates of EPCO. (4) Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services as of December 31, 2019. The estimated payment obligations are based on contractual prices in effect at December 31, 2019 applied to all future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery. (5) Primarily represents our unconditional payment obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts. (6) Represents unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or products to be delivered in connection with our capital expenditures, including our share of the capital expenditures of unconsolidated affiliates. (7) Primarily represents the Liquidity Option liability, the noncurrent portion of asset retirement obligations and deferred revenues. We expect that the Liquidity Option will be replaced with a long-term deferred tax liability of similar amount upon exercise of the Liquidity Option. For a discussion of the Liquidity Option and the effects of the option exercise, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. \nWe are obligated to spend up to an aggregate $270 million over a ten-year period ending in 2025 on specified midstream gathering assets for certain producers utilizing our EFS Midstream System. If constructed, these new assets would be owned by us and be a component of the EFS Midstream System. As of December 31, 2019, we have spent $151 million of the $270 million commitment. Due to the uncertain timing of the remaining potential capital expenditures, we have excluded this amount from the preceding table.\nFor additional information regarding our significant contractual obligations, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nFor information regarding recent changes in our accounting for leases, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nInsurance\nFor information regarding insurance matters, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.", "item_7_tables":

report:\n\nOverview\n- Enterprise Products Partners L.P. is a midstream energy services company providing services related to natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.\n\n- They have a large network of pipelines, storage facilities, terminals, processing plants and other assets located primarily in the U.S.\n\n- Safety and environmental responsibility are top priorities in operations.\n\n2019 Highlights\n- Placed $5.4 billion of major growth projects into service, including pipelines, processing plants, export terminals, and facilities for producing petrochemical feedstocks. \n\n- Continued construction on $7.7 billion of growth projects scheduled through 2023, including fractionators, pipelines, gas processing plants, ethylene facilities, and export terminals.\n\n- Expect total 2020 capital investments of $3.4-$4.4 billion.\n\nFinancial Results  \n- 2019 revenue of $32.8 billion, down from $36.5 billion in 2018, primarily due to lower commodity prices. Net income increased to $4.7 billion from $4.2 billion.\n\n- Lower commodity prices drove decreased marketing revenue, offset by increased revenues from expansion projects. Operating margin increased across all four business segments.\n\n- Interest costs increased due to higher debt balances from financing growth projects, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. \n\n- Strong cash from operations of $6.5 billion in 2019 funded the capital investment program and distributions to partners. Distribution coverage ratio was 1.7x."}
