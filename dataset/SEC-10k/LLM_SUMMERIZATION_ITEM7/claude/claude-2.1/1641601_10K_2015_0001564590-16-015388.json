Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this document. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nThe following discussion pertains to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when specifically identified.\nOur Business\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Prattville, Alabama. We operate one subsidiary bank - River Bank and Trust ( RB&T\u201d or the Bank\u201d).\nThrough the Bank, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through nine full-service banking offices in Alabama. RB&T is scheduled to open an additional branch location in Millbrook, Alabama by mid-2016.\n2015 Merger\nOn December 31, 2015, we merged with Keystone Bancshares, Inc. (Keystone) with River Financial Corporation being the survivor. At the same time, Keystone's wholly owned subsidiary bank, Keystone Bank, was merged into RB&T. Keystone's common shareholders received 1 share of our common stock and $4.00 in cash in exchange for each share of Keystone's common stock. We paid an aggregate of $7,273,968 in cash and issued 1,818,492 shares of our common stock. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration paid was $36.4 million. We recorded $9.4million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $2.8 million.\nWe marked Keystone's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available, and these fair value adjustments are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date as additional information becomes available. We acquired approximately $251.8 million in assets at fair value from Keystone and added three banking offices with approximately $169.1 million in loans and approximately $206.0 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the Keystone merger is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2015 Results\nOur net income was $2.4 million in 2015, compared with $3.5 million in 2014. The largest contributing factors leading to the decrease in the 2015 net income and other highlights include the following:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We recognized merger-related expenses in 2015 of approximately $673 thousand for investment banking, legal, audit, and other services. We also recognized expense in 2015 of approximately $1.3 million to terminate existing contracts for various data processing services and to provide de-conversion services in order to allow us to convert to new systems that we expect to better provide for growth and improved customer service over the next 5-10 years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Average loans outstanding in 2015 were $288.9 million, approximately 15.2% higher than $250.8 million in average loans outstanding in 2014.

Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgment is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes the more complex policies involving a significant amount of judgments about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting RFC's allowance for loan losses include judgments about: creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimated credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by RFC may be different than management's estimates provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included elsewhere in this document.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nPeriodically, we assess whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In such instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recover in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax assets or benefits will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversing of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. On the date of acquisition, when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since\norigination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. In addition, purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are also handled under this method.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nNet Income\n2015 vs. 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income was $2.4 million, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 31.9%. The primary reason for the decrease in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was an increase in noninterest expense. The largest expense increases were for merger-related costs for the Keystone merger and data processing expenses for contract termination and de-conversion costs to convert to a new data processing system. The merger-related expenses total approximately $673 thousand and the data processing expenses totaled approximately $1.3 million. Total noninterest expense increased $3.2 million from $10.6 million in 2014 to $13.8 million in 2015.Excluding the merger-related and data processing conversion expenses, noninterest expenses increased $1.3 million.\nNet interest income increased to $15.1 million in 2015 from $14.2 million in 2014, or 6.4%. The increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in average total loans outstanding in 2015 of $38.2 million, or 15.2%, over 2014. Our net interest margin also saw a sizeable increase from 3.55% in 2014 to 3.69% in 2015 because of the loan growth.\nNoninterest income increased from $2.5 million in 2014 to $2.9 million in 2015, or 17.4%. This increase was driven by the inception of non-deposit investment brokerage services in 2015 which produced $199 thousand in revenue. Income from bank owned life insurance increased $131 thousand in 2015 following the purchase in late 2014 of additional bank owned life insurance.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the years 2015 and 2014, the average balance of each principal category of our assets and liabilities and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS & NET INTEREST INCOME\nTable 81:

</tr>\n</table>\nComparison of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nNet interest income increased $915 thousand, or 6.4%, to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $14.2 million for 2014. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $862 thousand, resulting from higher levels of loan volume and $52 thousand decrease in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 15.2% increase in average loans outstanding during 2015 compared to 2014. The resulting net interest margin for 2015 rose to 3.69%, from 3.55% during 2014. The net interest margin in 2015 benefited from a decrease in the effective rate and average volume of total interest-bearing liabilities and also an increase in non-interest bearing deposits. During 2015, non-interest bearing deposits averaged $87.3 million, compared to $77.8 million during 2014, an increase of $9.5 million, or 12.2%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $409.9 million for 2015, compared to $399.9 million for 2014, an increase of $925 thousand, or 0.23%. The mix of average earning assets in 2015 shifted toward loans as average loans increased $38.2 million during 2015 to $288.9 million from $250.8 million in 2014 while total investment securities decreased $26.9 million during 2015 to $115.8 million compared to $142.70 million in 2014. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.10% during 2015, compared to 3.97% for 2014. The yield on earning assets increased primarily due to an increased average volume in loans during 2015. During 2015, loan yields decreased 17 basis points to 4.88%. The decrease in loan yields was primarily due to amortization of loans and continued repricing to lower market interest rates.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $314.1 million for 2015, compared to $311.9 million for 2014, a decrease of $52 thousand. The decrease in average volume occurred in the time deposit category as we continued to place emphasis on growing lower cost deposits and aggressively pricing time deposits to reduce cost. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.39% for 2015, compared to 0.41% for 2014. Each category of deposits experienced rate reductions in 2015 compared to 2014. We have benefited from the historically low interest rates and repriced time deposits at maturity at the lower current market rates, and we have also lowered rates on other deposit accounts to lower market rates where possible. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was offset by the rate reductions and resulted in slightly lower total interest expense for 2015.\nThe following table reflects, for the years 2015 and 2014, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates earned or paid on the assets and liabilities.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2015 vs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\ndue to\nYield/Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (491\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loans held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (530\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (575\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax-exempt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing balances in other banks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (603\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing transaction accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings and money market accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (94\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (48\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (52\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income (taxable equivalent)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (599\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxable equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (212\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (449\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $556 thousand compared to $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the provision for loan losses resulted from improvement in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and lower net loan charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs decreased from $980 thousand in 2014 to $507 thousand in 2015. The allowance for loan losses is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. In determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider our historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition, and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. When individual loans are evaluated for impairment, and impairment is deemed necessary, the impaired portion of the loan amount is generally charged off. As of December 31, 2015, $1.3 million of our allowance was related to impaired loans.\nNoninterest Income\nIn addition to net interest margin, we generate other types of recurring noninterest income from our operations. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We have a mortgage division that generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, and from the sale of non-deposit investment products through an arrangement with a registered broker-dealer with which we have a revenue-sharing arrangement. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, the Bank owns insurance on several key employees and records income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies.\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment brokerage revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank owned life insurance income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain on sale of investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The primary reasons for the increase in noninterest income were increased investment brokerage revenue and bank owned life insurance income. We started offering investment brokerage services in 2015 and generated revenue of $199 thousand compared to none in 2014. Bank owned life insurance income increased from $176 thousand in 2014 to $307 thousand in 2015 because of an additional investment in bank owned life insurance. Service charges and fees continued to be our largest source of noninterest income in 2015 with $1.9 million compared to $1.8 million in 2014. These service charges and fees are primarily generated by checking and savings accounts.\nNoninterest expense\nOur total noninterest expense increase reflects our continued growth, as well as the expansion of our operational framework, employee expansion, and facility expansion, as we build the foundation to support our recent and future growth. We believe that some of our overhead costs will reduce as a percentage of our revenue as we grow and gain operating leverage by spreading these costs over a larger revenue base.\nThe following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment rentals, depreciation, and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telephone and communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and business development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreclosed assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal deposit insurance and other regulatory assessments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal and other professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $13.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively, an increase of $3.2 million, or 30.3%. The largest component of noninterest expense was salaries and employee benefits. Salaries continue to increase as we expand our presence in the markets in which we operate. During 2015, we opened a new full-service office in Alexander City, Alabama and we began providing investment brokerage services to our customers. These were the primary reasons for the increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2015 which increased from $5.6 million in 2014 to $6.3 million in 2015. The opening of the new Alexander City, Alabama full-service office in 2015 was the main reason for the increase in occupancy expenses in 2015 to $941 thousand from $829 thousand in 2014.\nThe largest increases in noninterest expense occurred in data processing expense and legal and other professional service expense. The increase in data processing expense of $1.4 million was almost entirely related to the recognition of the termination of data processing service contracts and de-conversion fees as we prepare to convert to a new core data processing system. We made the decision to change to the new core data processing system because we believe the new system will provide better service for our customers and better operating efficiency internally. Legal and professional services expense increased from $255 thousand in 2014 to $1 million in 2015. This increase resulted largely from merger-related expenses for our merger with Keystone Bancshares that\noccurred on December 31, 2015. These merger-related expenses accounted for $673 thousand of the increase in total legal and other professional services expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax expense of $1.3 million and $1.5 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense during 2015 was due to a decrease in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the year 2015 was 34.8% compared to 30.4% for the year 2014. The effective tax rates are affected by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal and state taxation. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to non-deductible merger-related expenses.\nComparison of Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOverview\nOur total assets increased $271.3 million, or 60.7%, from $446.7 million at December 31, 2014, to $718.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total assets at December 31, 2015 included the assets of Keystone which was merged with and into River on December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of the acquired assets of Keystone, total assets increased $28.9 million during 2015. Excluding the impact of the acquired loans from Keystone, loans increased by $42.2 million during 2015. Excluding the investment securities acquired from Keystone, investment securities decreased $19.9 million in 2015 as cash flows from the portfolio were used to fund loan growth. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $5.6 million during 2015.\nDeposits at December 31, 2015 totaled $610.4 million, an increase of $222.6 million as compared to December 31, 2014. Excluding the deposits assumed in the Keystone acquisition, deposits increased $16.0 million during 2015. Our deposits increased during 2015 due to the successful business development efforts of our employees as we continue to move banking relationships from other financial institutions. Additionally, the Bank has also benefited from excess liquidity in the financial markets, as investors are unwilling to make long-term investments due to the low interest rate environment and elect to maintain cash in interest-bearing transaction and money market accounts.\nLoans\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. Total loans averaged $288.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, or 70.5% of average earning assets, as compared to $250.8 million or 62.7% of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, total loans, net of unearned income, were $479.3 million, compared to $265.1 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $214.2 million, or 80.8%. Excluding the impact of the loans acquired from Keystone totaling $172.0 million, loans increased $42.2 million, or 15.9%, during 2015.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions and overall growth in our markets. Much of our loan growth has come from moving customers from other financial institutions to RB&T. We have also been successful in building banking relationships with new customers. We have hired several new bankers in the markets that we serve, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and attracting new clients to RB&T. Our bankers are expected to be involved in their communities and to maintain business development efforts to develop relationships with clients, and our philosophy is to be responsive to customer needs by providing decisions in a timely manner. In addition to our business development efforts, many of the markets that we serve have shown signs of economic recovery over the last few years.\nThe table below provides a summary of the loan

secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. It is common practice for financial institutions in our market areas, and for us in particular, to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. This practice tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio. In many cases, we prefer real estate collateral to many other potential collateral sources, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment.\nThe principal component of our loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans on residential and commercial properties. At December 31, 2015, this category totaled $332.3 million and represented 68.2% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $171.9 million, or 64.7% of the total loan portfolio at year-end 2014. Each category of real estate mortgage loans increased during 2015, as described in more detail below.\nLoans secured by residential properties ( residential real estate loans\u201d) increased $94.5million, or 130.0%, to $167.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $72.7 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, residential real estate loans increased $13.2 million, or 18.2%, during 2015.\nCommercial real estate loans increased $65.9 million to $165.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $99.2 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, commercial real estate loans increased $13.2 million, or 13.3%, during 2015. Of the $165.1 million in total commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2015, approximately $94.3 million were secured by owner-occupied properties.\nReal estate construction loans totaled $55.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase $30.8 million, or 123.2%, over $25.0 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, real estate construction loans increased $7.5 million, or 29.9%. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, this loan type accounted for 11.4% and 9.4%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio.\nCommercial and industrial loans totaled $79.6 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $55.8 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, commercial and industrial loans increased $11.0 million, or 19.7% during 2015. We expect this growth trend with respect to commercial and industrial loans to continue as economic conditions improve.\nThe repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us.

in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio.\nInvestment Securities\nWe use our securities portfolio primarily to enhance our overall yield on interest-earning assets and as a source of liquidity, as a tool to manage our balance sheet sensitivity and regulatory capital ratios, and as a base upon which to pledge assets for public deposits. When our liquidity position exceeds current needs and our expected loan demand, other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative. As investments mature, they are used to meet current cash needs, or they are reinvested to maintain our desired liquidity position. We have designated all of our securities as available-for-sale to provide flexibility, in case an immediate need for liquidity arises, and we believe that the composition of the portfolio offers needed flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of related deferred taxes. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in income using the interest method over the terms of the securities.\nThe following tables summarize the amortized cost and fair value of securities

though we may in some situations also invest in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the United States. All of our mortgage-backed securities are residential securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or FHLMC. During all periods presented, we have used most of our excess liquidity to invest in loans, as our loan demand has remained strong, rather than investing in investment securities.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, Provision and Asset Quality\nAllowance for loan losses and provision\nOur allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the required allowance each quarter based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance for loan losses.\nManagement utilizes a review process for the loan portfolio to identify loans that are deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when the loan is deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring. For loans and loan relationships deemed to be impaired that are $100 thousand, or greater, management determines the estimated value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to acquire and sell the collateral, or the estimated net present value of the cash flows expected to be received on the loan or loan relationship. These amounts are compared to the current investment in the loan and a specific allowance for the deficiency, if any, is specifically included in the analysis of the allowance for loan losses. For loans and loan relationships less than $100 thousand that are deemed to be impaired, management applies a loss factor of 15% and includes that amount in that analysis of the allowance for loan losses rather than specifically measuring the impairment for each loan or loan relationship.\nAll other loans are deemed to be unimpaired and are grouped into various homogeneous risk pools utilizing regulatory reporting classifications. The Bank's historical loss factors are calculated for each of these risk pools based on the net losses experienced as a percentage of the average loans outstanding. The time periods utilized in these historical loss factor calculations are subjective and vary according to management's estimate of the impact of current economic cycles. As every loan has a risk of loss, minimum loss\nfactors are estimated based on long term trends for the Bank, the banking industry, and the economy. The greater of the calculated historical loss factors or the minimum loss factors are applied to the unimpaired loan amounts currently outstanding for the risk pool and included in the analysis of the allowance for loan losses. In addition, certain qualitative adjustments may be included by management as additional loss factors applied to the unimpaired loan risk pools. These adjustments may include, among other things, changes in loan policy, loan administration, loan, geographic, or industry concentrations, loan growth rates, and experience levels of our lending officers. The loss allocations for specifically impaired loans, smaller impaired loans not specifically measured for impairment, and unimpaired loans are totaled to determine the total required allowance for loan losses. This total is compared to the current allowance on the Bank's books and adjustments made accordingly by a charge or credit to the provision for loan losses.\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods and dates indicated.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amounts in thousands, (except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charge-offs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loans on real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total mortgage loans on real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recoveries:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loans on real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total mortgage loans on real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans outstanding, net of deferred loan fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 479,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 265,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average loans outstanding, net of deferred loan fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 250,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to period end loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe preceding table does not include the allowance for loan losses of Keystone. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, Keystone's allowance for loan losses was not brought forward at acquisition; rather, the acquired loans were recorded at fair value and any discount to fair value was recorded against the loans rather than as an allowance for loan losses. No portion of the discount was deemed related to credit quality. The total discount was recorded as an accretable discount and will be accreted into interest income over the life of the loans using the level yield method. At December 31, 2015, Keystone's acquired loan portfolio totaled $176.3 million and had a related accretable discount of $7.2 million.\nOverall, asset quality indicators have continued to improve, and, as a result, provision expense has been minimal for the Bank's loan portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded provision expense of $556 thousand and $1.1 million, respectively.\nAllocation of Our Allowance for Loan Losses\nWhile no portion of our allowance for loan losses is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following table

a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. In addition to consideration of these factors, loans that are past due 90 days or more are generally placed on nonaccrual status. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status will generally be applied to the outstanding principal balance. When a problem loan is finally resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan losses.\nTotal nonperforming assets increased $1.9 million to $5.2 million at December 31, 2015, from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014. Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2015 are nonaccrual loans acquired from Keystone totaling $171 thousand and other real estate and repossessed assets acquired from Keystone of $783 thousand. Excluding the acquired nonperforming assets, nonperforming assets increased $915 thousand. Improving asset quality has been and will continue to be a primary focus of management.\nDeposits\nDeposits, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings, time, and other deposits, are the primary funding source for the Bank. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with primary focus on building and expanding client relationships.

A source that we have used for wholesale funding is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB\u201d). We had FHLB borrowings of $10.5 million at December 31, 2015 and $6.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\nFunds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources, including the core deposit base, the repayment and maturity of loans, and investment security cash flows. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposit, and borrowings from the FHLB.\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015and 2014 were $31.0 million and $25.4 million, respectively. Based on the recorded cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity resources were sufficient at December 31, 2015 to fund loans and meet other cash needs as necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nWhile our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity, the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on future obligations.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> through\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> through\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of less than $100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of $100 or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recorded on our balance sheet. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated.\nCREDIT EXTENSION COMMITMENTS\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stand-by and performance letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Sensitivity and Market Risk\nInterest Sensitivity\nWe monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on net interest income. The principal monitoring technique we employ is simulation analysis and this technique is augmented by gap\u201d analysis.\nIn simulation analysis, we review each individual asset and liability category and their projected behavior in various different interest rate environments. These projected behaviors are based upon management's past experiences and upon current competitive environments, including the various environments in the different markets in which we compete. Using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs, the simulation analysis generates as output projections of net interest income. We also periodically verify the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models.\nAnother technique used in interest rate management, but to a lesser degree than simulation analysis, is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap,\u201d which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities, selling securities available for sale or trading securities, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing and sources and prices of off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk. We use computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios. The modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time.\nThe following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2015, assuming that the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid, respectively, based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities.\nINTEREST SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nTable 96:

asset-sensitive gap (a positive number) and generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we are liability-sensitive (a negative number). As shown in the table above, we are slightly liability-sensitive on a cumulative basis through two years. The interest sensitivity analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market- based rates such as those paid on non-core deposits. For this and other reasons, management relies more upon the simulation analysis (as noted above) in managing interest rate risk. Net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nMarket Risk\nOur earnings are dependent, to a large degree, on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest paid on all interest bearing-liabilities, primarily deposits. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in our lending, investing, and deposit gathering activities. We seek to reduce our exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing interest rate risk. Management relies upon static gap\u201d analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which quantifies, to a large extent, the degree of market risk inherent in our balance sheet. Gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates. Simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from 400 basis points below the current prevailing rates to 400 basis points above the current prevailing rates. Management makes certain assumptions as to the effect that varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest bearing-liabilities, which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources.\nThe following table illustrates the results of our simulation analysis to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest margin for the next 12 months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts from current rates. As noted above, this model uses estimates and assumptions in asset and liability account rate reactions to changes in prevailing interest rates. However, to isolate the market risk inherent in the balance sheet, the model assumes that no growth in the balance sheet occurs during the projection period. This model also assumes an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates, which would result in no change in the shape or slope of the interest rate yield curve. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the simulation model to derive this market risk information, the actual results of the future impact of market risk on our net interest margin may (and most likely will) differ from that found in the table.\nMARKET RISK\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impact on net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in prevailing rates:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 400 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.87\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.12\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 300 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.49\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.19\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.58\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.79\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.25\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 0 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.39\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.10\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.65\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 300 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.56\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.05\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 400 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.50\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.43\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $74.9 million, or 10.4% of total assets. At December 31, 2014, total shareholders' equity was $44.0 million, or 9.9% of total assets. The increase in shareholders' equity for 2015 was attributable to the Keystone acquisition and net income. We issued 1,818,492 shares of common stock valued at approximately $29.1 million to former shareholders of Keystone at the time of the Keystone merger.\nThe bank regulatory agencies have established risk-based capital requirements for banks. These guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank's capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories. Banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against off-balance sheet\u201d activities such as loans sold with recourse, loan commitments, guarantees, and standby letters of credit. These guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity, such as preferred stock, that may be included in capital. Certain items, such as goodwill and other intangible assets, are deducted from total capital in arriving at the various regulatory capital measures such as Tier 1 capital and total risk based capital. Our objective is to maintain the Bank's current status as a well-capitalized institution,\u201d as that term is defined by the Bank's regulators. As of December 31, 2015, RB&T was well-capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.\nChanges to the regulatory guidelines for bank capital levels that became effective January 1, 2015, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. The required ratio\nof Tier 1 Capital\u201d (consisting generally of shareholders' equity and qualifying preferred stock, less certain goodwill items and other intangible assets) to risk-weighted assets is 6%. While there was previously no required ration of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\u201d (which generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, certain qualifying capital instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, subject to adjustments) to total risk-weighted assets, a required minimum ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015, as well. The remainder of total capital, or Tier 2 Capital,\u201d may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (b) preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, (c) hybrid capital instruments, (d) perpetual debt, (e) mandatory convertible securities, and (f) certain subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock up to 50% of Tier 1 Capital. Total Capital is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital (which is included only to the extent of Tier 1 Capital), less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and any other deductions as determined by the appropriate regulator.\nIn addition, the federal banking regulators have established minimum leverage ratio requirements for banking organizations they supervise, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. Prior to January 1, 2015, banks meeting certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing significant growth or expansion, were permitted to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 3%. Other banks were generally required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio between 4% and 5%. Effective January 1, 2015, the required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%.\nThe following table contains selected consolidated capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014 for the Bank.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY ANALYSIS\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> As of December 31, 2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Required For Capital\nAdequacy Purposes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> To Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt Corrective\nAction Regulations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Capital (To Risk-Weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 10.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\n(To Risk- weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 4.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 6.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital (To Risk-Weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 6.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 8.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital (To Average Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.76\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 5.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> As of December 31, 2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Required For Capital\nAdequacy Purposes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> To Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt Corrective\nAction Regulations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Capital (To Risk-Weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.65\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 10.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital (To Risk-Weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 6.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital (To Average Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.68\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 5.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank's Total Capital ratio and Tier 1 Capital (To Risk-weighted Assets) ratio declined from year-end 2014 to year-end 2015 because of growth in loans and assets and to the $7.3 million in cash consideration paid in the Keystone acquisition. Despite the reduction, the ratios remain above the levels for the Bank to be deemed well-capitalized.\nThe Bank's Tier 1 Capital (To Average Assets) ratio, or leverage ratio, for December 31, 2015 of 15.76% was substantially higher than at December 31, 2014. The ratio was impacted by the utilization of adjusted average assets for the quarter ended that date that included the average adjusted assets of RB&T for the entire quarter ended December 31, 2015 and the adjusted average Keystone assets only for one day because the merger took place on the last day of the quarter. This calculation was done in compliance with the regulatory guidelines. For comparative purposes, if the adjusted assets of Keystone were included for the entire quarter ended December 31, 2015, the ratio would have been 10.08%.\nBanking regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay without approval of the regulatory authorities. These restrictions are based on the bank's level of regulatory classified assets, prior years' net earnings and ratio of equity capital to assets. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amount of dividend the Bank could declare payable to the Company was approximately $9.4 million.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this document. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nThe following discussion pertains to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when specifically identified.\nOur Business\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Prattville, Alabama. We operate one subsidiary bank - River Bank and Trust ( RB&T\u201d or the Bank\u201d).\nThrough the Bank, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through nine full-service banking offices in Alabama. RB&T is scheduled to open an additional branch location in Millbrook, Alabama by mid-2016.\n2015 Merger\nOn December 31, 2015, we merged with Keystone Bancshares, Inc. (Keystone) with River Financial Corporation being the survivor. At the same time, Keystone's wholly owned subsidiary bank, Keystone Bank, was merged into RB&T. Keystone's common shareholders received 1 share of our common stock and $4.00 in cash in exchange for each share of Keystone's common stock. We paid an aggregate of $7,273,968 in cash and issued 1,818,492 shares of our common stock. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration paid was $36.4 million. We recorded $9.4million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $2.8 million.\nWe marked Keystone's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available, and these fair value adjustments are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date as additional information becomes available. We acquired approximately $251.8 million in assets at fair value from Keystone and added three banking offices with approximately $169.1 million in loans and approximately $206.0 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the Keystone merger is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2015 Results\nOur net income was $2.4 million in 2015, compared with $3.5 million in 2014. The largest contributing factors leading to the decrease in the 2015 net income and other highlights include the following:\n \u00b7 We recognized merger-related expenses in 2015 of approximately $673 thousand for investment banking, legal, audit, and other services. We also recognized expense in 2015 of approximately $1.3 million to terminate existing contracts for various data processing services and to provide de-conversion services in order to allow us to convert to new systems that we expect to better provide for growth and improved customer service over the next 5-10 years. \n \u00b7 Average loans outstanding in 2015 were $288.9 million, approximately 15.2% higher than $250.8 million in average loans outstanding in 2014. The higher average balance for total loans outstanding was the primary reason for the increase of $915 thousand in our net interest income. \n \u00b7 Average total investment securities in 2015 were $115.8 million compared to $142.7 million in 2014. The decrease resulted from utilizing cash flows from the investment portfolio to fund a substantial portion of the loan growth that occurred in 2015. \n \u00b7 Average non-interest bearing deposits grew from $77.8 million in 2014 to $87.3 million in 2015. \n \u00b7 The effective rate on total interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 0.41% in 2014 to 0.39% in 2015 as we aggressively worked to reduce our overall interest cost of funding earning assets. \n \u00b7 Our higher net interest income was offset by higher operating expenses, which grew to $13.8 million in 2015 from $10.6 million in 2014. The largest increases in operating expenses came from the merger and data processing expenses discussed above. \nBecause the merger with Keystone occurred at the close of business December 31, 2015, none of the operating income or expenses for Keystone are included in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in RFC's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgment is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes the more complex policies involving a significant amount of judgments about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting RFC's allowance for loan losses include judgments about: creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimated credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by RFC may be different than management's estimates provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included elsewhere in this document.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nPeriodically, we assess whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In such instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recover in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax assets or benefits will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversing of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. On the date of acquisition, when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since\norigination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. In addition, purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are also handled under this method.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nNet Income\n2015 vs. 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income was $2.4 million, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 31.9%. The primary reason for the decrease in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was an increase in noninterest expense. The largest expense increases were for merger-related costs for the Keystone merger and data processing expenses for contract termination and de-conversion costs to convert to a new data processing system. The merger-related expenses total approximately $673 thousand and the data processing expenses totaled approximately $1.3 million. Total noninterest expense increased $3.2 million from $10.6 million in 2014 to $13.8 million in 2015.Excluding the merger-related and data processing conversion expenses, noninterest expenses increased $1.3 million.\nNet interest income increased to $15.1 million in 2015 from $14.2 million in 2014, or 6.4%. The increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in average total loans outstanding in 2015 of $38.2 million, or 15.2%, over 2014. Our net interest margin also saw a sizeable increase from 3.55% in 2014 to 3.69% in 2015 because of the loan growth.\nNoninterest income increased from $2.5 million in 2014 to $2.9 million in 2015, or 17.4%. This increase was driven by the inception of non-deposit investment brokerage services in 2015 which produced $199 thousand in revenue. Income from bank owned life insurance increased $131 thousand in 2015 following the purchase in late 2014 of additional bank owned life insurance.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the years 2015 and 2014, the average balance of each principal category of our assets and liabilities and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS & NET INTEREST INCOME\nTable 81:

</tr>\n</table>\nComparison of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nNet interest income increased $915 thousand, or 6.4%, to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $14.2 million for 2014. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $862 thousand, resulting from higher levels of loan volume and $52 thousand decrease in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 15.2% increase in average loans outstanding during 2015 compared to 2014. The resulting net interest margin for 2015 rose to 3.69%, from 3.55% during 2014. The net interest margin in 2015 benefited from a decrease in the effective rate and average volume of total interest-bearing liabilities and also an increase in non-interest bearing deposits. During 2015, non-interest bearing deposits averaged $87.3 million, compared to $77.8 million during 2014, an increase of $9.5 million, or 12.2%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $409.9 million for 2015, compared to $399.9 million for 2014, an increase of $925 thousand, or 0.23%. The mix of average earning assets in 2015 shifted toward loans as average loans increased $38.2 million during 2015 to $288.9 million from $250.8 million in 2014 while total investment securities decreased $26.9 million during 2015 to $115.8 million compared to $142.70 million in 2014. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.10% during 2015, compared to 3.97% for 2014. The yield on earning assets increased primarily due to an increased average volume in loans during 2015. During 2015, loan yields decreased 17 basis points to 4.88%. The decrease in loan yields was primarily due to amortization of loans and continued repricing to lower market interest rates.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $314.1 million for 2015, compared to $311.9 million for 2014, a decrease of $52 thousand. The decrease in average volume occurred in the time deposit category as we continued to place emphasis on growing lower cost deposits and aggressively pricing time deposits to reduce cost. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.39% for 2015, compared to 0.41% for 2014. Each category of deposits experienced rate reductions in 2015 compared to 2014. We have benefited from the historically low interest rates and repriced time deposits at maturity at the lower current market rates, and we have also lowered rates on other deposit accounts to lower market rates where possible. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was offset by the rate reductions and resulted in slightly lower total interest expense for 2015.\nThe following table reflects, for the years 2015 and 2014, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates earned or paid on the assets and liabilities.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2015 vs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\ndue to\nYield/Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (491\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loans held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (530\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (575\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax-exempt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing balances in other banks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (603\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing transaction accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings and money market accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (94\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (48\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (52\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income (taxable equivalent)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (599\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxable equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (212\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (449\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $556 thousand compared to $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the provision for loan losses resulted from improvement in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and lower net loan charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs decreased from $980 thousand in 2014 to $507 thousand in 2015. The allowance for loan losses is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. In determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider our historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition, and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. When individual loans are evaluated for impairment, and impairment is deemed necessary, the impaired portion of the loan amount is generally charged off. As of December 31, 2015, $1.3 million of our allowance was related to impaired loans.\nNoninterest Income\nIn addition to net interest margin, we generate other types of recurring noninterest income from our operations. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We have a mortgage division that generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, and from the sale of non-deposit investment products through an arrangement with a registered broker-dealer with which we have a revenue-sharing arrangement. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, the Bank owns insurance on several key employees and records income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies.\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment brokerage revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank owned life insurance income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain on sale of investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The primary reasons for the increase in noninterest income were increased investment brokerage revenue and bank owned life insurance income. We started offering investment brokerage services in 2015 and generated revenue of $199 thousand compared to none in 2014. Bank owned life insurance income increased from $176 thousand in 2014 to $307 thousand in 2015 because of an additional investment in bank owned life insurance. Service charges and fees continued to be our largest source of noninterest income in 2015 with $1.9 million compared to $1.8 million in 2014. These service charges and fees are primarily generated by checking and savings accounts.\nNoninterest expense\nOur total noninterest expense increase reflects our continued growth, as well as the expansion of our operational framework, employee expansion, and facility expansion, as we build the foundation to support our recent and future growth. We believe that some of our overhead costs will reduce as a percentage of our revenue as we grow and gain operating leverage by spreading these costs over a larger revenue base.\nThe following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment rentals, depreciation, and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telephone and communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and business development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreclosed assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal deposit insurance and other regulatory assessments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal and other professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $13.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively, an increase of $3.2 million, or 30.3%. The largest component of noninterest expense was salaries and employee benefits. Salaries continue to increase as we expand our presence in the markets in which we operate. During 2015, we opened a new full-service office in Alexander City, Alabama and we began providing investment brokerage services to our customers. These were the primary reasons for the increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2015 which increased from $5.6 million in 2014 to $6.3 million in 2015. The opening of the new Alexander City, Alabama full-service office in 2015 was the main reason for the increase in occupancy expenses in 2015 to $941 thousand from $829 thousand in 2014.\nThe largest increases in noninterest expense occurred in data processing expense and legal and other professional service expense. The increase in data processing expense of $1.4 million was almost entirely related to the recognition of the termination of data processing service contracts and de-conversion fees as we prepare to convert to a new core data processing system. We made the decision to change to the new core data processing system because we believe the new system will provide better service for our customers and better operating efficiency internally. Legal and professional services expense increased from $255 thousand in 2014 to $1 million in 2015. This increase resulted largely from merger-related expenses for our merger with Keystone Bancshares that\noccurred on December 31, 2015. These merger-related expenses accounted for $673 thousand of the increase in total legal and other professional services expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax expense of $1.3 million and $1.5 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense during 2015 was due to a decrease in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the year 2015 was 34.8% compared to 30.4% for the year 2014. The effective tax rates are affected by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal and state taxation. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to non-deductible merger-related expenses.\nComparison of Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOverview\nOur total assets increased $271.3 million, or 60.7%, from $446.7 million at December 31, 2014, to $718.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total assets at December 31, 2015 included the assets of Keystone which was merged with and into River on December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of the acquired assets of Keystone, total assets increased $28.9 million during 2015. Excluding the impact of the acquired loans from Keystone, loans increased by $42.2 million during 2015. Excluding the investment securities acquired from Keystone, investment securities decreased $19.9 million in 2015 as cash flows from the portfolio were used to fund loan growth. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $5.6 million during 2015.\nDeposits at December 31, 2015 totaled $610.4 million, an increase of $222.6 million as compared to December 31, 2014. Excluding the deposits assumed in the Keystone acquisition, deposits increased $16.0 million during 2015. Our deposits increased during 2015 due to the successful business development efforts of our employees as we continue to move banking relationships from other financial institutions. Additionally, the Bank has also benefited from excess liquidity in the financial markets, as investors are unwilling to make long-term investments due to the low interest rate environment and elect to maintain cash in interest-bearing transaction and money market accounts.\nLoans\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. Total loans averaged $288.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, or 70.5% of average earning assets, as compared to $250.8 million or 62.7% of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, total loans, net of unearned income, were $479.3 million, compared to $265.1 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $214.2 million, or 80.8%. Excluding the impact of the loans acquired from Keystone totaling $172.0 million, loans increased $42.2 million, or 15.9%, during 2015.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions and overall growth in our markets. Much of our loan growth has come from moving customers from other financial institutions to RB&T. We have also been successful in building banking relationships with new customers. We have hired several new bankers in the markets that we serve, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and attracting new clients to RB&T. Our bankers are expected to be involved in their communities and to maintain business development efforts to develop relationships with clients, and our philosophy is to be responsive to customer needs by providing decisions in a timely manner. In addition to our business development efforts, many of the markets that we serve have shown signs of economic recovery over the last few years.\nThe table below provides a summary of the loan

secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. It is common practice for financial institutions in our market areas, and for us in particular, to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. This practice tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio. In many cases, we prefer real estate collateral to many other potential collateral sources, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment.\nThe principal component of our loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans on residential and commercial properties. At December 31, 2015, this category totaled $332.3 million and represented 68.2% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $171.9 million, or 64.7% of the total loan portfolio at year-end 2014. Each category of real estate mortgage loans increased during 2015, as described in more detail below.\nLoans secured by residential properties ( residential real estate loans\u201d) increased $94.5million, or 130.0%, to $167.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $72.7 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, residential real estate loans increased $13.2 million, or 18.2%, during 2015.\nCommercial real estate loans increased $65.9 million to $165.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $99.2 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, commercial real estate loans increased $13.2 million, or 13.3%, during 2015. Of the $165.1 million in total commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2015, approximately $94.3 million were secured by owner-occupied properties.\nReal estate construction loans totaled $55.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase $30.8 million, or 123.2%, over $25.0 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, real estate construction loans increased $7.5 million, or 29.9%. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, this loan type accounted for 11.4% and 9.4%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio.\nCommercial and industrial loans totaled $79.6 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $55.8 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, commercial and industrial loans increased $11.0 million, or 19.7% during 2015. We expect this growth trend with respect to commercial and industrial loans to continue as economic conditions improve.\nThe repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us.

in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio.\nInvestment Securities\nWe use our securities portfolio primarily to enhance our overall yield on interest-earning assets and as a source of liquidity, as a tool to manage our balance sheet sensitivity and regulatory capital ratios, and as a base upon which to pledge assets for public deposits. When our liquidity position exceeds current needs and our expected loan demand, other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative. As investments mature, they are used to meet current cash needs, or they are reinvested to maintain our desired liquidity position. We have designated all of our securities as available-for-sale to provide flexibility, in case an immediate need for liquidity arises, and we believe that the composition of the portfolio offers needed flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of related deferred taxes. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in income using the interest method over the terms of the securities.\nThe following tables summarize the amortized cost and fair value of securities

though we may in some situations also invest in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the United States. All of our mortgage-backed securities are residential securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or FHLMC. During all periods presented, we have used most of our excess liquidity to invest in loans, as our loan demand has remained strong, rather than investing in investment securities.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, Provision and Asset Quality\nAllowance for loan losses and provision\nOur allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the required allowance each quarter based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance for loan losses.\nManagement utilizes a review process for the loan portfolio to identify loans that are deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when the loan is deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring. For loans and loan relationships deemed to be impaired that are $100 thousand, or greater, management determines the estimated value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to acquire and sell the collateral, or the estimated net present value of the cash flows expected to be received on the loan or loan relationship. These amounts are compared to the current investment in the loan and a specific allowance for the deficiency, if any, is specifically included in the analysis of the allowance for loan losses. For loans and loan relationships less than $100 thousand that are deemed to be impaired, management applies a loss factor of 15% and includes that amount in that analysis of the allowance for loan losses rather than specifically measuring the impairment for each loan or loan relationship.\nAll other loans are deemed to be unimpaired and are grouped into various homogeneous risk pools utilizing regulatory reporting classifications. The Bank's historical loss factors are calculated for each of these risk pools based on the net losses experienced as a percentage of the average loans outstanding. The time periods utilized in these historical loss factor calculations are subjective and vary according to management's estimate of the impact of current economic cycles. As every loan has a risk of loss, minimum loss\nfactors are estimated based on long term trends for the Bank, the banking industry, and the economy. The greater of the calculated historical loss factors or the minimum loss factors are applied to the unimpaired loan amounts currently outstanding for the risk pool and included in the analysis of the allowance for loan losses. In addition, certain qualitative adjustments may be included by management as additional loss factors applied to the unimpaired loan risk pools. These adjustments may include, among other things, changes in loan policy, loan administration, loan, geographic, or industry concentrations, loan growth rates, and experience levels of our lending officers. The loss allocations for specifically impaired loans, smaller impaired loans not specifically measured for impairment, and unimpaired loans are totaled to determine the total required allowance for loan losses. This total is compared to the current allowance on the Bank's books and adjustments made accordingly by a charge or credit to the provision for loan losses.\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods and dates indicated.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amounts in thousands, (except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charge-offs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loans on real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total mortgage loans on real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recoveries:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loans on real estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total mortgage loans on real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total recoveries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans outstanding, net of deferred loan fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 479,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 265,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average loans outstanding, net of deferred loan fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 250,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to period end loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe preceding table does not include the allowance for loan losses of Keystone. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, Keystone's allowance for loan losses was not brought forward at acquisition; rather, the acquired loans were recorded at fair value and any discount to fair value was recorded against the loans rather than as an allowance for loan losses. No portion of the discount was deemed related to credit quality. The total discount was recorded as an accretable discount and will be accreted into interest income over the life of the loans using the level yield method. At December 31, 2015, Keystone's acquired loan portfolio totaled $176.3 million and had a related accretable discount of $7.2 million.\nOverall, asset quality indicators have continued to improve, and, as a result, provision expense has been minimal for the Bank's loan portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded provision expense of $556 thousand and $1.1 million, respectively.\nAllocation of Our Allowance for Loan Losses\nWhile no portion of our allowance for loan losses is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following table

a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. In addition to consideration of these factors, loans that are past due 90 days or more are generally placed on nonaccrual status. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status will generally be applied to the outstanding principal balance. When a problem loan is finally resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan losses.\nTotal nonperforming assets increased $1.9 million to $5.2 million at December 31, 2015, from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014. Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2015 are nonaccrual loans acquired from Keystone totaling $171 thousand and other real estate and repossessed assets acquired from Keystone of $783 thousand. Excluding the acquired nonperforming assets, nonperforming assets increased $915 thousand. Improving asset quality has been and will continue to be a primary focus of management.\nDeposits\nDeposits, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings, time, and other deposits, are the primary funding source for the Bank. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with primary focus on building and expanding client relationships.

A source that we have used for wholesale funding is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB\u201d). We had FHLB borrowings of $10.5 million at December 31, 2015 and $6.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\nFunds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources, including the core deposit base, the repayment and maturity of loans, and investment security cash flows. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposit, and borrowings from the FHLB.\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015and 2014 were $31.0 million and $25.4 million, respectively. Based on the recorded cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity resources were sufficient at December 31, 2015 to fund loans and meet other cash needs as necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nWhile our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity, the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on future obligations.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> through\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> through\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due after\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of less than $100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of $100 or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recorded on our balance sheet. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated.\nCREDIT EXTENSION COMMITMENTS\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stand-by and performance letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Sensitivity and Market Risk\nInterest Sensitivity\nWe monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on net interest income. The principal monitoring technique we employ is simulation analysis and this technique is augmented by gap\u201d analysis.\nIn simulation analysis, we review each individual asset and liability category and their projected behavior in various different interest rate environments. These projected behaviors are based upon management's past experiences and upon current competitive environments, including the various environments in the different markets in which we compete. Using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs, the simulation analysis generates as output projections of net interest income. We also periodically verify the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models.\nAnother technique used in interest rate management, but to a lesser degree than simulation analysis, is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap,\u201d which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities, selling securities available for sale or trading securities, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing and sources and prices of off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk. We use computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios. The modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time.\nThe following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2015, assuming that the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid, respectively, based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities.\nINTEREST SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nTable 96:

asset-sensitive gap (a positive number) and generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we are liability-sensitive (a negative number). As shown in the table above, we are slightly liability-sensitive on a cumulative basis through two years. The interest sensitivity analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market- based rates such as those paid on non-core deposits. For this and other reasons, management relies more upon the simulation analysis (as noted above) in managing interest rate risk. Net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nMarket Risk\nOur earnings are dependent, to a large degree, on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest paid on all interest bearing-liabilities, primarily deposits. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in our lending, investing, and deposit gathering activities. We seek to reduce our exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing interest rate risk. Management relies upon static gap\u201d analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which quantifies, to a large extent, the degree of market risk inherent in our balance sheet. Gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates. Simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from 400 basis points below the current prevailing rates to 400 basis points above the current prevailing rates. Management makes certain assumptions as to the effect that varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest bearing-liabilities, which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources.\nThe following table illustrates the results of our simulation analysis to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest margin for the next 12 months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts from current rates. As noted above, this model uses estimates and assumptions in asset and liability account rate reactions to changes in prevailing interest rates. However, to isolate the market risk inherent in the balance sheet, the model assumes that no growth in the balance sheet occurs during the projection period. This model also assumes an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates, which would result in no change in the shape or slope of the interest rate yield curve. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the simulation model to derive this market risk information, the actual results of the future impact of market risk on our net interest margin may (and most likely will) differ from that found in the table.\nMARKET RISK\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impact on net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in prevailing rates:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 400 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.87\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.12\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 300 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.49\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.19\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.58\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.79\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.25\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> + 0 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.39\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.10\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.65\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 300 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.56\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.05\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> - 400 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.50\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.43\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $74.9 million, or 10.4% of total assets. At December 31, 2014, total shareholders' equity was $44.0 million, or 9.9% of total assets. The increase in shareholders' equity for 2015 was attributable to the Keystone acquisition and net income. We issued 1,818,492 shares of common stock valued at approximately $29.1 million to former shareholders of Keystone at the time of the Keystone merger.\nThe bank regulatory agencies have established risk-based capital requirements for banks. These guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank's capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories. Banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against off-balance sheet\u201d activities such as loans sold with recourse, loan commitments, guarantees, and standby letters of credit. These guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity, such as preferred stock, that may be included in capital. Certain items, such as goodwill and other intangible assets, are deducted from total capital in arriving at the various regulatory capital measures such as Tier 1 capital and total risk based capital. Our objective is to maintain the Bank's current status as a well-capitalized institution,\u201d as that term is defined by the Bank's regulators. As of December 31, 2015, RB&T was well-capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.\nChanges to the regulatory guidelines for bank capital levels that became effective January 1, 2015, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. The required ratio\nof Tier 1 Capital\u201d (consisting generally of shareholders' equity and qualifying preferred stock, less certain goodwill items and other intangible assets) to risk-weighted assets is 6%. While there was previously no required ration of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\u201d (which generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, certain qualifying capital instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, subject to adjustments) to total risk-weighted assets, a required minimum ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015, as well. The remainder of total capital, or Tier 2 Capital,\u201d may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (b) preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, (c) hybrid capital instruments, (d) perpetual debt, (e) mandatory convertible securities, and (f) certain subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock up to 50% of Tier 1 Capital. Total Capital is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital (which is included only to the extent of Tier 1 Capital), less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and any other deductions as determined by the appropriate regulator.\nIn addition, the federal banking regulators have established minimum leverage ratio requirements for banking organizations they supervise, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. Prior to January 1, 2015, banks meeting certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing significant growth or expansion, were permitted to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 3%. Other banks were generally required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio between 4% and 5%. Effective January 1, 2015, the required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%.\nThe following table contains selected consolidated capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014 for the Bank.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY ANALYSIS\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> As of December 31, 2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Required For Capital\nAdequacy Purposes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> To Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt Corrective\nAction Regulations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Capital (To Risk-Weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 10.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\n(To Risk- weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 4.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 6.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital (To Risk-Weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 6.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 8.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital (To Average Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.76\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 5.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> As of December 31, 2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Required For Capital\nAdequacy Purposes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> To Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt Corrective\nAction Regulations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Capital (To Risk-Weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.65\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 10.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital (To Risk-Weighted Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 6.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital (To Average Assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.68\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >= 5.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank's Total Capital ratio and Tier 1 Capital (To Risk-weighted Assets) ratio declined from year-end 2014 to year-end 2015 because of growth in loans and assets and to the $7.3 million in cash consideration paid in the Keystone acquisition. Despite the reduction, the ratios remain above the levels for the Bank to be deemed well-capitalized.\nThe Bank's Tier 1 Capital (To Average Assets) ratio, or leverage ratio, for December 31, 2015 of 15.76% was substantially higher than at December 31, 2014. The ratio was impacted by the utilization of adjusted average assets for the quarter ended that date that included the average adjusted assets of RB&T for the entire quarter ended December 31, 2015 and the adjusted average Keystone assets only for one day because the merger took place on the last day of the quarter. This calculation was done in compliance with the regulatory guidelines. For comparative purposes, if the adjusted assets of Keystone were included for the entire quarter ended December 31, 2015, the ratio would have been 10.08%.\nBanking regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay without approval of the regulatory authorities. These restrictions are based on the bank's level of regulatory classified assets, prior years' net earnings and ratio of equity capital to assets. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amount of dividend the Bank could declare payable to the Company was approximately $9.4 million.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this document. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nThe following discussion pertains to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when specifically identified.\nOur Business\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Prattville, Alabama. We operate one subsidiary bank - River Bank and Trust ( RB&T\u201d or the Bank\u201d).\nThrough the Bank, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through nine full-service banking offices in Alabama. RB&T is scheduled to open an additional branch location in Millbrook, Alabama by mid-2016.\n2015 Merger\nOn December 31, 2015, we merged with Keystone Bancshares, Inc. (Keystone) with River Financial Corporation being the survivor. At the same time, Keystone's wholly owned subsidiary bank, Keystone Bank, was merged into RB&T. Keystone's common shareholders received 1 share of our common stock and $4.00 in cash in exchange for each share of Keystone's common stock. We paid an aggregate of $7,273,968 in cash and issued 1,818,492 shares of our common stock. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration paid was $36.4 million. We recorded $9.4million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $2.8 million.\nWe marked Keystone's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available, and these fair value adjustments are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date as additional information becomes available. We acquired approximately $251.8 million in assets at fair value from Keystone and added three banking offices with approximately $169.1 million in loans and approximately $206.0 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the Keystone merger is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2015 Results\nOur net income was $2.4 million in 2015, compared with $3.5 million in 2014. The largest contributing factors leading to the decrease in the 2015 net income and other highlights include the following:\n \u00b7 We recognized merger-related expenses in 2015 of approximately $673 thousand for investment banking, legal, audit, and other services. We also recognized expense in 2015 of approximately $1.3 million to terminate existing contracts for various data processing services and to provide de-conversion services in order to allow us to convert to new systems that we expect to better provide for growth and improved customer service over the next 5-10 years. \n \u00b7 Average loans outstanding in 2015 were $288.9 million, approximately 15.2% higher than $250.8 million in average loans outstanding in 2014. The higher average balance for total loans outstanding was the primary reason for the increase of $915 thousand in our net interest income. \n \u00b7 Average total investment securities in 2015 were $115.8 million compared to $142.7 million in 2014. The decrease resulted from utilizing cash flows from the investment portfolio to fund a substantial portion of the loan growth that occurred in 2015. \n \u00b7 Average non-interest bearing deposits grew from $77.8 million in 2014 to $87.3 million in 2015. \n \u00b7 The effective rate on total interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 0.41% in 2014 to 0.39% in 2015 as we aggressively worked to reduce our overall interest cost of funding earning assets. \n \u00b7 Our higher net interest income was offset by higher operating expenses, which grew to $13.8 million in 2015 from $10.6 million in 2014. The largest increases in operating expenses came from the merger and data processing expenses discussed above. \nBecause the merger with Keystone occurred at the close of business December 31, 2015, none of the operating income or expenses for Keystone are included in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in RFC's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgment is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes the more complex policies involving a significant amount of judgments about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting RFC's allowance for loan losses include judgments about: creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimated credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by RFC may be different than management's estimates provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included elsewhere in this document.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nPeriodically, we assess whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In such instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recover in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax assets or benefits will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversing of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. On the date of acquisition, when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since\norigination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. In addition, purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are also handled under this method.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nNet Income\n2015 vs. 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income was $2.4 million, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 31.9%. The primary reason for the decrease in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was an increase in noninterest expense. The largest expense increases were for merger-related costs for the Keystone merger and data processing expenses for contract termination and de-conversion costs to convert to a new data processing system. The merger-related expenses total approximately $673 thousand and the data processing expenses totaled approximately $1.3 million. Total noninterest expense increased $3.2 million from $10.6 million in 2014 to $13.8 million in 2015.Excluding the merger-related and data processing conversion expenses, noninterest expenses increased $1.3 million.\nNet interest income increased to $15.1 million in 2015 from $14.2 million in 2014, or 6.4%. The increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in average total loans outstanding in 2015 of $38.2 million, or 15.2%, over 2014. Our net interest margin also saw a sizeable increase from 3.55% in 2014 to 3.69% in 2015 because of the loan growth.\nNoninterest income increased from $2.5 million in 2014 to $2.9 million in 2015, or 17.4%. This increase was driven by the inception of non-deposit investment brokerage services in 2015 which produced $199 thousand in revenue. Income from bank owned life insurance increased $131 thousand in 2015 following the purchase in late 2014 of additional bank owned life insurance.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the years 2015 and 2014, the average balance of each principal category of our assets and liabilities and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS & NET INTEREST INCOME\n\nComparison of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nNet interest income increased $915 thousand, or 6.4%, to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $14.2 million for 2014. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $862 thousand, resulting from higher levels of loan volume and $52 thousand decrease in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 15.2% increase in average loans outstanding during 2015 compared to 2014. The resulting net interest margin for 2015 rose to 3.69%, from 3.55% during 2014. The net interest margin in 2015 benefited from a decrease in the effective rate and average volume of total interest-bearing liabilities and also an increase in non-interest bearing deposits. During 2015, non-interest bearing deposits averaged $87.3 million, compared to $77.8 million during 2014, an increase of $9.5 million, or 12.2%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $409.9 million for 2015, compared to $399.9 million for 2014, an increase of $925 thousand, or 0.23%. The mix of average earning assets in 2015 shifted toward loans as average loans increased $38.2 million during 2015 to $288.9 million from $250.8 million in 2014 while total investment securities decreased $26.9 million during 2015 to $115.8 million compared to $142.70 million in 2014. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 13 basis points to 4.10% during 2015, compared to 3.97% for 2014. The yield on earning assets increased primarily due to an increased average volume in loans during 2015. During 2015, loan yields decreased 17 basis points to 4.88%. The decrease in loan yields was primarily due to amortization of loans and continued repricing to lower market interest rates.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $314.1 million for 2015, compared to $311.9 million for 2014, a decrease of $52 thousand. The decrease in average volume occurred in the time deposit category as we continued to place emphasis on growing lower cost deposits and aggressively pricing time deposits to reduce cost. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.39% for 2015, compared to 0.41% for 2014. Each category of deposits experienced rate reductions in 2015 compared to 2014. We have benefited from the historically low interest rates and repriced time deposits at maturity at the lower current market rates, and we have also lowered rates on other deposit accounts to lower market rates where possible. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was offset by the rate reductions and resulted in slightly lower total interest expense for 2015.\nThe following table reflects, for the years 2015 and 2014, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates earned or paid on the assets and liabilities.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $556 thousand compared to $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the provision for loan losses resulted from improvement in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and lower net loan charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs decreased from $980 thousand in 2014 to $507 thousand in 2015. The allowance for loan losses is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. In determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider our historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition, and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. When individual loans are evaluated for impairment, and impairment is deemed necessary, the impaired portion of the loan amount is generally charged off. As of December 31, 2015, $1.3 million of our allowance was related to impaired loans.\nNoninterest Income\nIn addition to net interest margin, we generate other types of recurring noninterest income from our operations. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We have a mortgage division that generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, and from the sale of non-deposit investment products through an arrangement with a registered broker-dealer with which we have a revenue-sharing arrangement. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, the Bank owns insurance on several key employees and records income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies.\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.\n\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The primary reasons for the increase in noninterest income were increased investment brokerage revenue and bank owned life insurance income. We started offering investment brokerage services in 2015 and generated revenue of $199 thousand compared to none in 2014. Bank owned life insurance income increased from $176 thousand in 2014 to $307 thousand in 2015 because of an additional investment in bank owned life insurance. Service charges and fees continued to be our largest source of noninterest income in 2015 with $1.9 million compared to $1.8 million in 2014. These service charges and fees are primarily generated by checking and savings accounts.\nNoninterest expense\nOur total noninterest expense increase reflects our continued growth, as well as the expansion of our operational framework, employee expansion, and facility expansion, as we build the foundation to support our recent and future growth. We believe that some of our overhead costs will reduce as a percentage of our revenue as we grow and gain operating leverage by spreading these costs over a larger revenue base.\nThe following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated.\n\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $13.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively, an increase of $3.2 million, or 30.3%. The largest component of noninterest expense was salaries and employee benefits. Salaries continue to increase as we expand our presence in the markets in which we operate. During 2015, we opened a new full-service office in Alexander City, Alabama and we began providing investment brokerage services to our customers. These were the primary reasons for the increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2015 which increased from $5.6 million in 2014 to $6.3 million in 2015. The opening of the new Alexander City, Alabama full-service office in 2015 was the main reason for the increase in occupancy expenses in 2015 to $941 thousand from $829 thousand in 2014.\nThe largest increases in noninterest expense occurred in data processing expense and legal and other professional service expense. The increase in data processing expense of $1.4 million was almost entirely related to the recognition of the termination of data processing service contracts and de-conversion fees as we prepare to convert to a new core data processing system. We made the decision to change to the new core data processing system because we believe the new system will provide better service for our customers and better operating efficiency internally. Legal and professional services expense increased from $255 thousand in 2014 to $1 million in 2015. This increase resulted largely from merger-related expenses for our merger with Keystone Bancshares that\noccurred on December 31, 2015. These merger-related expenses accounted for $673 thousand of the increase in total legal and other professional services expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax expense of $1.3 million and $1.5 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense during 2015 was due to a decrease in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the year 2015 was 34.8% compared to 30.4% for the year 2014. The effective tax rates are affected by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal and state taxation. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to non-deductible merger-related expenses.\nComparison of Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOverview\nOur total assets increased $271.3 million, or 60.7%, from $446.7 million at December 31, 2014, to $718.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total assets at December 31, 2015 included the assets of Keystone which was merged with and into River on December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of the acquired assets of Keystone, total assets increased $28.9 million during 2015. Excluding the impact of the acquired loans from Keystone, loans increased by $42.2 million during 2015. Excluding the investment securities acquired from Keystone, investment securities decreased $19.9 million in 2015 as cash flows from the portfolio were used to fund loan growth. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $5.6 million during 2015.\nDeposits at December 31, 2015 totaled $610.4 million, an increase of $222.6 million as compared to December 31, 2014. Excluding the deposits assumed in the Keystone acquisition, deposits increased $16.0 million during 2015. Our deposits increased during 2015 due to the successful business development efforts of our employees as we continue to move banking relationships from other financial institutions. Additionally, the Bank has also benefited from excess liquidity in the financial markets, as investors are unwilling to make long-term investments due to the low interest rate environment and elect to maintain cash in interest-bearing transaction and money market accounts.\nLoans\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. Total loans averaged $288.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, or 70.5% of average earning assets, as compared to $250.8 million or 62.7% of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, total loans, net of unearned income, were $479.3 million, compared to $265.1 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $214.2 million, or 80.8%. Excluding the impact of the loans acquired from Keystone totaling $172.0 million, loans increased $42.2 million, or 15.9%, during 2015.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions and overall growth in our markets. Much of our loan growth has come from moving customers from other financial institutions to RB&T. We have also been successful in building banking relationships with new customers. We have hired several new bankers in the markets that we serve, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and attracting new clients to RB&T. Our bankers are expected to be involved in their communities and to maintain business development efforts to develop relationships with clients, and our philosophy is to be responsive to customer needs by providing decisions in a timely manner. In addition to our business development efforts, many of the markets that we serve have shown signs of economic recovery over the last few years.\nThe table below provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition as of the periods indicated.\nCOMPOSITION OF LOAN PORTFOLIO\n\nIn the context of this discussion, a real estate mortgage loan\u201d is defined as any loan, other than a loan for construction purposes, secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. It is common practice for financial institutions in our market areas, and for us in particular, to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. This practice tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio. In many cases, we prefer real estate collateral to many other potential collateral sources, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment.\nThe principal component of our loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans on residential and commercial properties. At December 31, 2015, this category totaled $332.3 million and represented 68.2% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $171.9 million, or 64.7% of the total loan portfolio at year-end 2014. Each category of real estate mortgage loans increased during 2015, as described in more detail below.\nLoans secured by residential properties ( residential real estate loans\u201d) increased $94.5million, or 130.0%, to $167.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $72.7 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, residential real estate loans increased $13.2 million, or 18.2%, during 2015.\nCommercial real estate loans increased $65.9 million to $165.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $99.2 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, commercial real estate loans increased $13.2 million, or 13.3%, during 2015. Of the $165.1 million in total commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2015, approximately $94.3 million were secured by owner-occupied properties.\nReal estate construction loans totaled $55.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase $30.8 million, or 123.2%, over $25.0 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, real estate construction loans increased $7.5 million, or 29.9%. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, this loan type accounted for 11.4% and 9.4%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio.\nCommercial and industrial loans totaled $79.6 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $55.8 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Keystone loans, commercial and industrial loans increased $11.0 million, or 19.7% during 2015. We expect this growth trend with respect to commercial and industrial loans to continue as economic conditions improve.\nThe repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table sets forth our loans maturing within specific intervals at December 31, 2015.\nLOAN MATURITY AND SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES\n\nThe information presented in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio.\nInvestment Securities\nWe use our securities portfolio primarily to enhance our overall yield on interest-earning assets and as a source of liquidity, as a tool to manage our balance sheet sensitivity and regulatory capital ratios, and as a base upon which to pledge assets for public deposits. When our liquidity position exceeds current needs and our expected loan demand, other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative. As investments mature, they are used to meet current cash needs, or they are reinvested to maintain our desired liquidity position. We have designated all of our securities as available-for-sale to provide flexibility, in case an immediate need for liquidity arises, and we believe that the composition of the portfolio offers needed flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of related deferred taxes. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in income using the interest method over the terms of the securities.\nThe following tables summarize the amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES\n\nThe following table shows the scheduled maturity and average yields of our securities at December 31, 2015.\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES MATURITY DISTRIBUTION AND YIELDS\n\nWe invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities, and obligations of government-sponsored entities and agencies of the United States, though we may in some situations also invest in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the United States. All of our mortgage-backed securities are residential securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or FHLMC. During all periods presented, we have used most of our excess liquidity to invest in loans, as our loan demand has remained strong, rather than investing in investment securities.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, Provision and Asset Quality\nAllowance for loan losses and provision\nOur allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the required allowance each quarter based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance for loan losses.\nManagement utilizes a review process for the loan portfolio to identify loans that are deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when the loan is deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring. For loans and loan relationships deemed to be impaired that are $100 thousand, or greater, management determines the estimated value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to acquire and sell the collateral, or the estimated net present value of the cash flows expected to be received on the loan or loan relationship. These amounts are compared to the current investment in the loan and a specific allowance for the deficiency, if any, is specifically included in the analysis of the allowance for loan losses. For loans and loan relationships less than $100 thousand that are deemed to be impaired, management applies a loss factor of 15% and includes that amount in that analysis of the allowance for loan losses rather than specifically measuring the impairment for each loan or loan relationship.\nAll other loans are deemed to be unimpaired and are grouped into various homogeneous risk pools utilizing regulatory reporting classifications. The Bank's historical loss factors are calculated for each of these risk pools based on the net losses experienced as a percentage of the average loans outstanding. The time periods utilized in these historical loss factor calculations are subjective and vary according to management's estimate of the impact of current economic cycles. As every loan has a risk of loss, minimum loss\nfactors are estimated based on long term trends for the Bank, the banking industry, and the economy. The greater of the calculated historical loss factors or the minimum loss factors are applied to the unimpaired loan amounts currently outstanding for the risk pool and included in the analysis of the allowance for loan losses. In addition, certain qualitative adjustments may be included by management as additional loss factors applied to the unimpaired loan risk pools. These adjustments may include, among other things, changes in loan policy, loan administration, loan, geographic, or industry concentrations, loan growth rates, and experience levels of our lending officers. The loss allocations for specifically impaired loans, smaller impaired loans not specifically measured for impairment, and unimpaired loans are totaled to determine the total required allowance for loan losses. This total is compared to the current allowance on the Bank's books and adjustments made accordingly by a charge or credit to the provision for loan losses.\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods and dates indicated.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\n\nThe preceding table does not include the allowance for loan losses of Keystone. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, Keystone's allowance for loan losses was not brought forward at acquisition; rather, the acquired loans were recorded at fair value and any discount to fair value was recorded against the loans rather than as an allowance for loan losses. No portion of the discount was deemed related to credit quality. The total discount was recorded as an accretable discount and will be accreted into interest income over the life of the loans using the level yield method. At December 31, 2015, Keystone's acquired loan portfolio totaled $176.3 million and had a related accretable discount of $7.2 million.\nOverall, asset quality indicators have continued to improve, and, as a result, provision expense has been minimal for the Bank's loan portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded provision expense of $556 thousand and $1.1 million, respectively.\nAllocation of Our Allowance for Loan Losses\nWhile no portion of our allowance for loan losses is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following table represents management's allocation of our allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories for the periods indicated.\nALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\n\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table presents our nonperforming assets for the dates indicated.\nNONPERFORMING ASSETS\n\nAccrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. In addition to consideration of these factors, loans that are past due 90 days or more are generally placed on nonaccrual status. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status will generally be applied to the outstanding principal balance. When a problem loan is finally resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan losses.\nTotal nonperforming assets increased $1.9 million to $5.2 million at December 31, 2015, from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014. Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2015 are nonaccrual loans acquired from Keystone totaling $171 thousand and other real estate and repossessed assets acquired from Keystone of $783 thousand. Excluding the acquired nonperforming assets, nonperforming assets increased $915 thousand. Improving asset quality has been and will continue to be a primary focus of management.\nDeposits\nDeposits, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings, time, and other deposits, are the primary funding source for the Bank. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with primary focus on building and expanding client relationships. We continue to focus on establishing a comprehensive relationship with consumer and business borrowers, seeking deposits as well as lending relationships.\nThe following table details the composition of our deposit portfolio as of the dates indicated.\nCOMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS\n\nTotal deposits were $610.4 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $222.6 million, or 57.4%, from December 31, 2014. Excluding the deposits of Keystone that we assumed upon consummation of the Keystone merger, deposits increased $16.0 million, or 4.1% during 2015.\nThe following table details the maturities of our time deposits which consist entirely of certificates of deposit.\nMATURITIES OF CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT\n\nDeposit growth has benefited to a large extent from uncertainty in the financial markets, which has increased the liquidity of many banks as consumers and businesses look for safe places for liquidity, thereby increasing bank deposits.\nOther Funding Sources\nWe supplement our deposit funding with wholesale funding when needed for balance sheet planning or when the terms are attractive and will not disrupt our offering rates in our markets. A source that we have used for wholesale funding is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB\u201d). We had FHLB borrowings of $10.5 million at December 31, 2015 and $6.0 million at December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\nFunds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources, including the core deposit base, the repayment and maturity of loans, and investment security cash flows. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposit, and borrowings from the FHLB.\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015and 2014 were $31.0 million and $25.4 million, respectively. Based on the recorded cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity resources were sufficient at December 31, 2015 to fund loans and meet other cash needs as necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nWhile our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity, the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on future obligations.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recorded on our balance sheet. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated.\nCREDIT EXTENSION COMMITMENTS\n\nInterest Sensitivity and Market Risk\nInterest Sensitivity\nWe monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on net interest income. The principal monitoring technique we employ is simulation analysis and this technique is augmented by gap\u201d analysis.\nIn simulation analysis, we review each individual asset and liability category and their projected behavior in various different interest rate environments. These projected behaviors are based upon management's past experiences and upon current competitive environments, including the various environments in the different markets in which we compete. Using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs, the simulation analysis generates as output projections of net interest income. We also periodically verify the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models.\nAnother technique used in interest rate management, but to a lesser degree than simulation analysis, is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap,\u201d which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities, selling securities available for sale or trading securities, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing and sources and prices of off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk. We use computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios. The modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time.\nThe following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2015, assuming that the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid, respectively, based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities.\nINTEREST SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\n\nWe generally benefit from increasing market rates of interest when we have an asset-sensitive gap (a positive number) and generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we are liability-sensitive (a negative number). As shown in the table above, we are slightly liability-sensitive on a cumulative basis through two years. The interest sensitivity analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market- based rates such as those paid on non-core deposits. For this and other reasons, management relies more upon the simulation analysis (as noted above) in managing interest rate risk. Net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nMarket Risk\nOur earnings are dependent, to a large degree, on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest paid on all interest bearing-liabilities, primarily deposits. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in our lending, investing, and deposit gathering activities. We seek to reduce our exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing interest rate risk. Management relies upon static gap\u201d analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which quantifies, to a large extent, the degree of market risk inherent in our balance sheet. Gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates. Simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from 400 basis points below the current prevailing rates to 400 basis points above the current prevailing rates. Management makes certain assumptions as to the effect that varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest bearing-liabilities, which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources.\nThe following table illustrates the results of our simulation analysis to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest margin for the next 12 months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts from current rates. As noted above, this model uses estimates and assumptions in asset and liability account rate reactions to changes in prevailing interest rates. However, to isolate the market risk inherent in the balance sheet, the model assumes that no growth in the balance sheet occurs during the projection period. This model also assumes an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates, which would result in no change in the shape or slope of the interest rate yield curve. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the simulation model to derive this market risk information, the actual results of the future impact of market risk on our net interest margin may (and most likely will) differ from that found in the table.\nMARKET RISK\n\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $74.9 million, or 10.4% of total assets. At December 31, 2014, total shareholders' equity was $44.0 million, or 9.9% of total assets. The increase in shareholders' equity for 2015 was attributable to the Keystone acquisition and net income. We issued 1,818,492 shares of common stock valued at approximately $29.1 million to former shareholders of Keystone at the time of the Keystone merger.\nThe bank regulatory agencies have established risk-based capital requirements for banks. These guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank's capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories. Banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against off-balance sheet\u201d activities such as loans sold with recourse, loan commitments, guarantees, and standby letters of credit. These guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity, such as preferred stock, that may be included in capital. Certain items, such as goodwill and other intangible assets, are deducted from total capital in arriving at the various regulatory capital measures such as Tier 1 capital and total risk based capital. Our objective is to maintain the Bank's current status as a well-capitalized institution,\u201d as that term is defined by the Bank's regulators. As of December 31, 2015, RB&T was well-capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.\nChanges to the regulatory guidelines for bank capital levels that became effective January 1, 2015, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. The required ratio\nof Tier 1 Capital\u201d (consisting generally of shareholders' equity and qualifying preferred stock, less certain goodwill items and other intangible assets) to risk-weighted assets is 6%. While there was previously no required ration of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\u201d (which generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, certain qualifying capital instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, subject to adjustments) to total risk-weighted assets, a required minimum ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015, as well. The remainder of total capital, or Tier 2 Capital,\u201d may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (b) preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, (c) hybrid capital instruments, (d) perpetual debt, (e) mandatory convertible securities, and (f) certain subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock up to 50% of Tier 1 Capital. Total Capital is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital (which is included only to the extent of Tier 1 Capital), less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and any other deductions as determined by the appropriate regulator.\nIn addition, the federal banking regulators have established minimum leverage ratio requirements for banking organizations they supervise, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. Prior to January 1, 2015, banks meeting certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing significant growth or expansion, were permitted to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 3%. Other banks were generally required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio between 4% and 5%. Effective January 1, 2015, the required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%.\nThe following table contains selected consolidated capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014 for the Bank.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY ANALYSIS\n\n\nThe Bank's Total Capital ratio and Tier 1 Capital (To Risk-weighted Assets) ratio declined from year-end 2014 to year-end 2015 because of growth in loans and assets and to the $7.3 million in cash consideration paid in the Keystone acquisition. Despite the reduction, the ratios remain above the levels for the Bank to be deemed well-capitalized.\nThe Bank's Tier 1 Capital (To Average Assets) ratio, or leverage ratio, for December 31, 2015 of 15.76% was substantially higher than at December 31, 2014. The ratio was impacted by the utilization of adjusted average assets for the quarter ended that date that included the average adjusted assets of RB&T for the entire quarter ended December 31, 2015 and the adjusted average Keystone assets only for one day because the merger took place on the last day of the quarter. This calculation was done in compliance with the regulatory guidelines. For comparative purposes, if the adjusted assets of Keystone were included for the entire quarter ended December 31, 2015, the ratio would have been 10.08%.\nBanking regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay without approval of the regulatory authorities. These restrictions are based on the bank's level of regulatory classified assets, prior years' net earnings and ratio of equity capital to assets. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amount of dividend the Bank could declare payable to the Company was approximately $9.4 million.", "item_7_tables": "Table 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

report:\n\nOverview:\n- Net income was $2.4 million in 2015, down from $3.5 million in 2014, primarily due to higher noninterest expenses related to the Keystone merger and data processing contract terminations. \n- Average loans grew 15.2% in 2015 compared to 2014, driving higher net interest income. Noninterest income also increased due to new investment brokerage services and higher income from bank owned life insurance.\n\nLoan Portfolio:\n- Total loans increased 80.8% in 2015, largely driven by the Keystone acquisition. Excluding the acquisition impact, organic loan growth was 15.9%. \n- Residential and commercial real estate loans comprise the majority of the loan portfolio. Construction and land development loans grew 123.2% in 2015, representing 11.4% of total loans.\n\nDeposits and Funding: \n- Total deposits increased 57.4% in 2015, primarily due to the Keystone acquisition. Excluding the acquisition impact, deposits grew 4.1%.\n- The company supplements deposits with FHLB borrowings and other wholesale funding when needed. \n\nCapital Resources:\n- Shareholders' equity increased due to the Keystone acquisition and net income. Capital ratios remain above levels required for the bank to be deemed well-capitalized.\n\nAsset Quality:\n- Asset quality improved in 2015, with lower net charge-offs and nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and assets. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from year-end 2014 to 2015."}
