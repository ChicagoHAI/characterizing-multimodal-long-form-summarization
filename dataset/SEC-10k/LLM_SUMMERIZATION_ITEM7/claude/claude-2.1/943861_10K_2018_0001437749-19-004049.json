In our opinion, on a long term basis, growth in oil and natural gas reserves, cash flow and production on a cost-effective basis are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and natural gas company.\nManagement strives to increase our oil and natural gas reserves, production and cash flow through exploration and development activities. We develop an annual capital expenditure budget, which is reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant. We take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing, such as bank debt, asset divestitures, issuance of debt and equity securities and strategic joint-ventures, when establishing our capital expenditure budget.\nWe place primary emphasis on our operating cash flow in managing our business. Management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income because operating cash flow considers only the cash expenses incurred during the period and excludes the non-cash impact of unrealized hedging gains (losses), non-cash general and administrative expenses and impairments.\nOur revenues and operating cash flow depend on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects with available capital, the volume and timing of our production, as well as commodity prices for oil and natural gas. Such pricing factors are largely beyond our control; however, we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is to provide long-term growth in reserves and cash flow on a cost-effective basis. We focus on maximizing our return on capital employed and adding reserve value through the timely development of our Haynesville Shale Trend acreage. We regularly evaluate possible acquisitions of prospective acreage and oil and natural gas drilling opportunities.\nSeveral of the key elements of our business strategy are the following:\nDevelop existing property base. We seek to maximize the value of our existing assets by developing and exploiting our properties that we have identified as having the lowest risk and the highest potential rates of return. To accomplish this strategy, we currently intend to develop our multi-year inventory of drilling locations and natural gas reserves on our Haynesville Shale Trend acreage.\nIncrease our natural gas production. We have concentrated on increasing our natural gas production and reserves by investing and drilling in the Haynesville Shale Trend. We intend to take advantage of improved completion technology to significantly increase production volume and consequently reduce our per unit finding cost and operating expenses.\nExpand acreage position in the Haynesville Shale Trend. As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 22,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale Trend. In addition to having significant experience in the play we intend to have significant operational control of our Haynesville Shale Trend assets. To leverage our extensive regional knowledge base, we seek to acquire leasehold acreage with significant drilling potential in areas that exhibit characteristics similar to our existing properties. We also continually strive to rationalize our portfolio of properties by selling marginal non-core properties in an effort to redeploy capital to exploitation, development and exploration projects that offer potentially higher overall returns.\nFocus on maximizing cash flow margins. We intend to maximize operating cash flow by focusing on higher-margin natural gas development in the Haynesville Shale Trend. In the current commodity price environment, our Haynesville Shale Trend assets offer more attractive rates of return on capital invested and cash flow margins than our oil assets.\nMaintain financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2018, we had $4.1 million in cash and a borrowing base of $75 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50 million, under our $250 million Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated October 17, 2017, by and between the Subsidiary, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, and certain lenders named therein (as amended, the 2017 Senior Credit Facility\u201d) on which we had $23 million available in borrowing capacity. We plan on funding growth primarily through operating cash flow. We actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives, including fixed price swaps and costless collars. The level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our view of market conditions, available hedge prices and our operating results.\nOverview of 2018 Results\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We conducted drilling or completion operations on 19 wells, adding 16 gross (7.5 net) wells to production in the Haynesville Shale Trend;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We ended the year with 480 Bcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves with a PV-10 of $418 million;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>We achieved an average daily equivalent production rate of 70,537 Mcfe per day representing a 112% increase from 2017; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We increased our oil and natural gas revenues to $87.9 million, representing an increase of 94% from 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>We generated net income of $1.8 million or $0.15 per share (basic) and $0.13 per share (diluted). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHaynesville Shale Trend\nOur relatively low risk development acreage in this trend is primarily centered in Caddo, DeSoto and Red River parishes, Louisiana and Angelina and Nacogdoches counties, Texas. We held approximately 41,000 gross (22,600 net) acres as of December 31, 2018 producing from or prospective for the Haynesville Shale Trend. We incurred drilling or completion costs on 19 wells in 2018, spending $103.3 million of which $0.1 million was leasehold cost. We added 16 gross (7.5 net) wells to production in 2018. Our net production volumes from our Haynesville Shale Trend wells represented approximately 95% of our total equivalent production on a Mcfe basis and substantially all of our total natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTuscaloosa Marine Shale Trend\nWe held approximately 50,500 gross (35,100 net) acres in the TMS as of December 31, 2018 with approximately 47,600 gross (32,900 net) acres held by production. During 2018, we sold 3 gross (2.0 net) wells and did not conduct any drilling operations in the TMS; however, we had 2 gross (1.7 net) wells drilled in 2015, which are still waiting on completion. Our net production volumes from our TMS wells represented approximately 5% of our total equivalent production on a Mcfe basis and approximately 99% of our total oil production for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, we did not spend any capital in the TMS; however, we did spend $0.9 million on workover expense activities to maintain volumes on producing wells.\nEagle Ford Shale Trend\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have retained approximately 12,300 net acres of undeveloped leasehold in Frio County, Texas, which is prospective for future development or sale.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported net income of $1.8 million, or $0.15 per share (basic) and $0.13 per share (diluted), on oil and gas revenues of $87.9 million. This compares to a net loss of $8.0 million, or $0.80 per share (basic and diluted) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The recurring items that had the most material financial effect on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 were increased oil and gas revenues offset by increased transportation and processing cost, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization cost and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges. All of these items can be primarily attributed to our increased production volumes, and to a lesser extent the increase in prices.\nThe following table reflects our summary operating information for the periods presented in thousands except for price and volume data. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activity and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as indicative of future results.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Summary Operating Information:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and condensate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas, oil and condensate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Production:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas (Mmcf)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and condensate (MBbls)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total (Mmcfe)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily production (Mcfe/d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Realized Sales Price Per Unit:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas (per Mcf)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas (per Mcf) including the effect of realized gains/losses on derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and condensate (per Bbl)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and condensate (per Bbl) including the effect of realized gains/losses on derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average realized price (per Mcfe)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.31 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOil and Natural Gas Revenue\nNatural gas, oil and condensate revenues increased in 2018 compared to 2017 reflecting increases in our average realized sales prices for natural gas, oil and condensate and an increase in natural gas production, offset by decreased oil and condensate production. The increases in realized sales prices and in natural gas production contributed approximately $6.2 million and $42.3 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue. Decreased oil and condensate production reduced revenue by approximately $5.9 million compared to 2017. The increase in natural gas production volumes is attributed to 16 Haynesville Shale Trend wells put on production during 2018. We continue to concentrate our operational activities and resources on increasing natural gas production in the Haynesville Shale Trend.\nThe difference between our average realized prices inclusive of net cash derivative settlements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relates to our oil and natural gas contracts. In 2018, we paid a net $1.4 million on natural gas derivative settlements on a daily average of approximately 30,600 Mmbtu with a weighted average fixed price of $3.01 per Mmbtu and paid a net $1.9 million on oil derivative settlements on a daily average of 375 barrels at a weighted average price of $51.08 per barrel. In 2017, we had oil derivative settlements on 400 Bbls per day, only for the month of December 2017, at the fixed price of $51.08 per Bbl, and natural gas derivative settlements on a daily average of 15,008 Mmbtu with a weighted average price of $3.49 per Mmbtu. We received $0.6 million in natural gas derivative settlements from our counterparties and paid our counterparties $0.1 million in oil derivative settlements in 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,679 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production and other taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transportation and processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> Per Mcfe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.59 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production and other taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transportation and processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.08 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLease Operating Expense\nLease operating expense decreased $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period in 2017. The decrease is substantially attributed to decreased workover expense and lower per unit costs for new Haynesville Shale Trend wells compared to the same period in 2017, offset by increased costs due to an increased well count in 2018. We incurred $3.4 million in workover expense for the year in 2017 and only $1.4 million for the year in 2018. The majority of the workover expense incurred in 2018 is attributed to our TMS wells in the effort to maintain our oil production. Lease operating expense exclusive of workover expense on a per unit basis was $0.35 and $0.72 per Mcfe for the years 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect per unit lease operating expense to continue to decrease as we increase production from the Haynesville Shale Trend, which carries a lower per unit lease operating expense than our current per unit rate.\nProduction and Other Taxes\nProduction and other taxes for the year ended 2018 included severance tax of $1.8 million and ad valorem tax of $0.8 million. Severance taxes increased $0.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by expiration of our oil severance tax exemptions in Mississippi and Louisiana and to a lesser extent an increase in revenues. The State of Mississippi has enacted an exemption from the existing 6.0% severance tax for horizontal wells drilled after July 1, 2013 with production commencing before July 1, 2023, which is partially offset by a 1.3% local severance tax on such wells. The exemption is applicable until the earlier of (i) 30 months from the date of first sale of production or (ii) payout of the well. The State of Louisiana has also enacted an exemption from the existing 12.5% severance tax on oil and from the $0.098 per Mcf (through June 30, 2017), $0.111 per Mcf (from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018) and $0.122 per Mcf (starting on July 1, 2018) severance tax on natural gas for horizontal wells with production commencing after July 31, 1994. The exemption is applicable until the earlier of (i) 24 months from the date of first sale of production or (ii) payout of the well. Our recently drilled Haynesville Shale Trend natural gas wells in Northwest Louisiana are currently benefiting from this exemption.\nAd valorem tax increased $0.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Ad valorem tax in 2017 included audit refunds of approximately $0.9 million while no refunds were received in 2018.\nTransportation and Processing\nOur natural gas production incurs substantially all of our transportation and processing cost. Transportation and processing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased while per unit expense decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting increased production from our operated Haynesville Shale Trend wells. Our natural gas volumes from operated wells generally carry less transportation cost than those from wells we do not operate. Our per unit transportation cost will continue to decrease as we increase our operated natural gas production under more favorable transportation contracts.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion & amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General & administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> Per Mcfe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion & amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General & administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.61 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation, Depletion & Amortization ( DD&A\u201d)\nDD&A expense in 2018 and 2017 was calculated on the Full Cost Method of Accounting. We adjust our DD&A rates twice a year in conjunction with issuance of our year-end (for the fourth and first quarters) and mid-year (for the second and third quarters) reserve reports. DD&A increased in 2018 versus prior year as a result of an increase in the DD&A rate based on the year-end 2018 reserve report and also because of additional production volumes to which the DD&A rate was applied. Included in DD&A for 2018 is the depletion of our oil and gas properties of $26.2 million, accretion of our Asset Retirement Obligation of $0.3 million and $0.3 million in depreciation of our furniture and fixtures.\nImpairment\nOur Full Cost Ceiling Test performed quarterly did not require recording an impairment in 2018 or 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense ( G&A\u201d)\nGeneral and Administrative Expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $19.7 million which includes $6.4 million of share based compensation. The $3.0 million increase in G&A expense in 2018 compared to 2017 is attributed to a $2.0 million increase in share based compensation and $1.0 million increase in employee related expenses, including employee benefits costs and accrued performance bonuses. We capitalized $3.5 million of G&A directly attributed to our capital development to the full cost pool during 2018. Our G&A expense per unit of production decreased in 2018 and is expected to continue to decrease entirely due to our increasing production volumes. It is anticipated that share based compensation expense will also decrease as no substantial stock awards were granted during 2018.\nOur 2017 Senior Credit Facility and 13.50% Convertible Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the Convertible Second Lien Notes\u201d, for which the due date has been extended to March 30, 2020) placed limitations on cash general and administrative expenses through December 31, 2017 to $10.1 million. G&A payable in cash, which excluded share-based compensation, accrued performance bonus to be compensated in stock and accrued rent expense, was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We capitalized $2.4 million of G&A directly attributed to our capital development to the full cost pool during 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income (Expense):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,944 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,725 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(728 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,986 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,538 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(357 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reorganization items gain (loss), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(305 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(423 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(358 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(921 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(94 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average funded borrowings adjusted for debt discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average funded borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in 2018 included $1.1 million incurred on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility and $10.8 million incurred on the Convertible Second Lien Notes. The interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes was all non-cash consisting of $6.7 million in paid-in-kind interest and amortized debt discount of $4.1 million.\nInterest expense in 2017 included $1.2 million incurred on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility and Exit Credit Facility and $8.5 million incurred on the Convertible Second Lien Notes. The interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes was all non-cash consisting of $5.9 million in paid-in-kind interest and amortized debt discount of $2.6 million.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $0.5 million primarily related to sales tax refunds received on audits we performed on a contingency basis.\nInterest income and other for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $1.2 million primarily related to the receipt of cash that was released from escrow upon a negotiated settlement on longstanding title issues.\nGain/Loss on Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges\nWe produce and sell oil and natural gas into a market where prices are historically volatile. We enter into swap contracts, collars or other derivative agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to commodity price risk for a portion of our production. We do not designate our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. Consequently, the changes in our mark to market valuations are recorded directly to income or loss on our financial statements.\nLoss on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges in 2018 was comprised of a mark to market loss of $0.8 million and a loss of $3.2 million from net cash settlements. The mark to market loss represented a $2.7 million loss in the fair value of our natural gas derivative contracts offset by a $1.9 million gain in the fair value of our oil derivative contracts. The loss on cash settlements reflected a net $1.3 million paid to our counter-parties on settlement of our natural gas derivatives and a net $1.9 million paid to our counter-parties on settlement of oil derivatives.\nGain on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges in 2017 was comprised of a mark to market gain of $1.1 million and gain from net cash settlements of $0.5 million. The mark to market gain represented a $2.6 million gain in the fair value of our natural gas derivative contracts offset by a $1.5 million loss in the fair value of our oil derivative contracts. The net gain on cash settlements reflected $0.6 million cash received on settlement of our natural gas derivatives offset by $0.1 million payment on the settlement on our oil derivatives.\nReorganization items, net\nWe settled the final outstanding bankruptcy claims in 2018, which resulted in a net reorganization loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 including legal and trustee fees. We settled all remaining claims and closed our bankruptcy case in the third quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we distributed the remaining approximately 39 thousand shares of common stock and related warrants that were granted to the creditors per the Plan of Reorganization.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe recorded a $0.1 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a $1.0 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017. We maintained a valuation allowance at December 31, 2018, which resulted in no net deferred tax asset or liability appearing on our statement of financial position with the exception of a deferred tax asset related to alternative minimum tax ( AMT\u201d) credits. We recorded this valuation allowance after an evaluation of all available evidence (including our recent history of net operating losses in 2017 and prior years) that led to a conclusion that based upon the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature our deferred tax assets were unrecoverable. The income tax benefits recorded in 2018 and 2017 were due to the projected refund of AMT credits for which we also recorded a non-current deferred tax asset and a current receivable for the amount we expect to receive in 2019.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation known as the H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the Act\u201d), resulting in significant modifications to existing law. The Company completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during 2017. Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected certain effects of the Act which included a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, as well as other changes.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principle ( US GAAP\u201d) financial measure that is used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income and similar taxes, DD&A, share-based compensation expense and impairment of oil and natural gas properties (if any). In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, gains on reorganization, gains/losses on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges and net cash received or paid in settlement of derivative instruments are also excluded. Other excluded items include interest income and any extraordinary non-cash gains or losses. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by US GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), as defined by US GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-US GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the US GAAP measure of net income (loss), its most directly comparable measure presented in accordance with US GAAP:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) (US GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,996 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(978 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share based compensation expense (non-cash)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,863 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,725 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on reorganization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,552 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash received (paid) in settlement of derivative instruments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,236 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other items (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Other items include interest income and other, gain on sale of assets and other expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes that this non-US GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors because it is monitored and used by our management and widely used by professional research analysts in the valuation and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly totaled measures of other companies.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur primary sources of cash during 2018 were cash on hand at the beginning of the year of $26.0 million, cash flow from operating activities of $49\ufeff.2 million, cash proceeds of $26.\ufeff8 million from asset sales and $10.3 million net cash draws under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We used $105.1 million in cash to fund our drilling and development capital program and used $3.1 million for purchases of treasury stock for tax withholding purposes related to stock compensation.\nOn October 17, 2017, we entered into the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, which provides for revolving loans of up to the borrowing base then in effect. Total lender commitments under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are $250 million subject to a borrowing base limitation, which as of December 31, 2018 was $75 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50 million. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures on a) October 17, 2021 or b) December 30, 2019, if the Convertible Second Lien Notes have not been voluntarily redeemed, repurchased, refinanced or otherwise retired by December 30, 2019. Revolving borrowings under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are limited to, and subject to periodic redeterminations of, the borrowing base. The amount of the borrowing base is determined by the lenders in their sole discretion and consistent with their oil and gas lending criteria at the time of the relevant redetermination. We may, however, elect to reduce the proposed borrowing base to a lower draw limit by providing notice to the lenders contemporaneously with each redetermination of the borrowing base. Pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, borrowing base redeterminations will be on a semi-annual basis on or about March 1st and September 1st of each calendar year. The borrowing base is subject to additional adjustments from time to time, including for asset sales, elimination or reduction of hedge positions and incurrence of other debt. Additionally, we and the administrative agent may request one unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base between scheduled redeterminations. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the lead lender and administrative agent under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nWe exited 2018 with $4.1 million of cash on hand and $27.0 million of outstanding borrowings with $23.0 million of availability under the current borrowing base of $50.0 million on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We are beginning 2019 with $27.1 million in immediately available capital resources.\nDue to the timing of payment of our capital expenditures and timing of borrowings under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility, we reflected a working capital deficit of $21.0 million as of December 31, 2018. To the extent we operate with a working capital deficit, we expect such deficit to be offset by the liquidity available under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nOutlook\nOur total capital expenditures for 2019 are expected to be approximately $90 to $100 million with flexibility to increase or decrease this amount based on the movement of commodity prices. We plan to focus all of our capital on drilling and development of our Haynesville Shale Trend natural gas properties in North Louisiana, and we currently contemplate drilling and developing 11 gross (9.8 net) wells utilizing improved completion techniques.\nWe believe the results of the capital investments we made in 2018 will generate additional cash flows and additional value that will allow us to raise capital to continue our capital development into 2019 and beyond.\nIn addition, to support future cash flows, we entered into strategic derivative positions as of December 31, 2018 covering approximately 53% of our anticipated oil and natural gas sales volumes for 2019. See Note 9- Derivative Activities\u201d in the Notes to consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe continuously monitor our balance sheet and coordinate our capital program with our expected cash flows and scheduled debt repayments. We will continue to evaluate funding alternatives as needed.\nAlternatives available to us include:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> availability under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> issuance of equity securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> issuance of debt securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> joint ventures in our TMS and/or Haynesville Shale Trend acreage; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> sale of non-core assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> Cash flow statement information:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Cash:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(78,249 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,200 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(964 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,924 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,858 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018, our heavily weighted capital expenditures in the second half of 2018 resulted in a working capital deficit of $21.0 million, which was more than offset by the liquidity available under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We had approximately $76.8 million in long-term debt as of December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nOperating activities: Production from our wells, the price of oil and natural gas and operating costs represent the main drivers of our cash flow from operations. Changes in working capital and net cash settlements related to our derivative contracts also impacted cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $49.2 million including operating cash flows before working capital changes of $46.3 million reduced by net cash payments of $3.2 million for settlements of derivative contracts. The substantial increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to a 94% increase in oil and natural gas revenues driven by a 112% increase in equivalent production volumes.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflected cash expended on capital projects of $105.1 million reduced by $26.8 million cash proceeds received from sales of oil and gas properties. We recorded $106.9 million in capital expenditures in this period, which reflected the utilization of $1.2 million of cash calls paid in the previous period, the utilization of $1.9 million from materials inventory, capitalization of $0.4 million in asset retirement obligation and capitalization of $0.7 million of non-cash internal cost reduced by a net $2.4 million in the change of the capital expenditure accrual. We conducted drilling and completion operations on 19 gross (12.1 net) wells bringing 16 gross (7.5 net) wells on production in the Haynesville Shale Trend during the year ended December 31, 2018, and we capitalized $3.5 million in internal costs. We had 5 gross (4.6 net) wells waiting completion at December 31, 2018.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $7.1 million consisting of net draws of $10.3 million on the 2017 Senior credit facility reduced by $3.1 million for the purchase of shares withheld from employee stock awards for the payments of taxes and $0.1 million of debt issuance cost paid upon the amendment of the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $18.3 million. Production from our wells, the price of oil and natural gas and operating costs represented the main drivers of our cash flow from operations. In addition, net cash settlements of $0.5 million related to our derivative contracts and a $0.5 million change in working capital also positively impacted cash flows.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recorded $41.8 million in capital expenditures, of which we paid out cash amounts totaling $28.8 million for drilling and development operations in the year. The difference was attributed to the utilization of $0.4 million of cash calls paid in the previous period, the utilization of $1.8 million from materials inventory, $0.2 million in asset retirement obligation capitalized and a net $10.6 million increase in the capital expenditure accrual. The period also reflected the receipt of $0.6 million in proceeds from the sales of various non-producing mineral interests in non-core areas. We conducted drilling operations on 13 wells and completed 2 wells, all in the Haynesville Shale Trend, during the year ended December 31, 2017, and we capitalized $2.4 million in internal costs.\nFinancing activities: Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million consisting of $16.7 million payoff of the balance on the Exit Credit Facility, $0.3 million in registration and issuance costs associated with various securities issued since our emergence from bankruptcy or to be issued in the future, and $0.7 million in issuance cost incurred on the entering into the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, offset by the $16.7 million in proceeds from the new credit facility.\nDebt consisted of the following balances as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Carrying\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fair\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Carrying\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fair\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017 Senior Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Convertible Second Lien Notes (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,026 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The carrying amounts for the 2017 Senior Credit Facility represent fair value as it was fully secured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> The debt discount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method based upon a maturity date of August 30, 2019.

The 2017 Senior Credit Facility amends, restates and refinances the obligations under the Exit Credit Facility. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures (a) October 17, 2021 or (b) December 30, 2019, if the Convertible Second Lien Notes (as defined below) have not been voluntarily redeemed, repurchased, refinanced or otherwise retired by December 30, 2019. The maximum credit amount under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility is currently $250.0 million with a borrowing base of $75.0 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50.0 million. The borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined in March and September of each calendar year, and is subject to additional adjustments from time to time, including for asset sales, elimination or reduction of hedge positions and incurrence of other debt. Additionally, both the Subsidiary and the administrative agent may request one unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base between scheduled redeterminations. The amount of the borrowing base is determined by the lenders in their sole discretion and consistent with their oil and gas lending criteria at the time of the relevant redetermination. The Company may also request the issuance of letters of credit under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility in an aggregate amount up to $10.0 million, which reduce the amount of available borrowings under the borrowing base in the amount of such issued and outstanding letters of credit.\nAll amounts outstanding under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, either (i) the alternative base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base that is utilized, or (ii) adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin from 2.75% to 3.75%, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base that is utilized. Undrawn amounts under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are subject to a 0.50% commitment fee. To the extent that a payment default exists and is continuing, all amounts outstanding under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility will bear interest at 2.00% per annum above the rate and margin otherwise applicable thereto.\nThe 2017 Senior Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including (i) the maintenance of a ratio of Total Debt (as defined in the 2017 Senior Credit Facility) to EBITDAX not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, (ii) the maintenance of a current ratio (based on the ratio of current assets plus availability under the current borrowing base to current liabilities) not to be less than 1.00 to 1.00 and (iii) until no Convertible Second Lien Notes remain outstanding, (A) the maintenance of a ratio of Total Proved PV-10 attributable to the Company's and Borrower's Proved Reserves (as defined in the 2017 Senior Credit Facility) to Total Secured Debt (net of any Unrestricted Cash not to exceed $10.0 million) not to be less than 1.50 to 1.00, (B) minimum liquidity requirements.\nThe obligations under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company.\nConvertible Second Lien Notes\nOn October 12, 2016, upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company and the Subsidiary entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with each entity identified as a Shenkman Purchaser on Appendix A to the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the Shenkman Purchasers\u201d), CVC Capital Partners (acting through such of its affiliates to managed funds as it deems appropriate), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (acting through such of its affiliates or managed funds as it deems appropriate), Franklin Advisers, Inc. (as investment manager on behalf of certain funds and accounts), O'Connor Global Multi- Strategy Alpha Master Limited and Nineteen 77 Global Multi-Strategy Alpha (Levered) Master Limited (collectively, and together with each of their successors and assigns, the Purchasers\u201d), in connection with the issuance of $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 13.50% Convertible Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2019 ( Convertible Second Lien Notes\u201d).\nThe aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Second Lien Notes is convertible at the option of the Purchasers at any time prior to the scheduled maturity date at $21.33 per share representing 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock, subject to adjustments. At closing, the Purchasers were issued 10-year costless warrants equal to 2.5 million shares of common stock. Holders of the Convertible Second Lien Notes have a second priority lien on all assets of the Company, and have a continuing right to appoint two members to our Board of Directors as long as the Convertible Second Lien Notes are outstanding.\nThe Convertible Second Lien Notes, as set forth in the agreement, were to mature on August 30, 2019 or six months after the maturity of our current revolving credit facility but in no event later than March 30, 2020. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures no earlier than December 30, 2019; consequently, the Convertible Second Lien Notes will mature on March 30, 2020. The Convertible Second Lien Notes bear interest at the rate of 13.50% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The Company may elect to pay all or any portion of interest in-kind on the then outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Second Lien Notes by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Second Lien Notes or by issuing additional Second Lien Notes ( PIK Interest Notes\u201d). The PIK Interest Notes are not convertible. During such time as the Exit Credit Agreement (but not any refinancing or replacement thereof) is in effect, interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes must be paid in-kind; provided however, that after the quarter ending March 31, 2018, if (i) there is no default, event of default or borrowing base deficiency that has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the ratio of total debt to EBITDAX as defined under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility is less than 1.75 to 1.0 and (iii) the unused borrowing base is at least 25%, then the Company can pay the interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes in cash, at its election.\nThe Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes contains certain covenants pertaining to us and our subsidiary, including delivery of financial reports; environmental matters; conduct of business; use of proceeds; operation and maintenance of properties; collateral and guarantee requirements; indebtedness; liens; dividends and distributions; limits on sale of assets and stock; business activities; transactions with affiliates; and changes of control.\nThe Indenture also contains certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of (i) a Total Proved Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement) not to be less than 1.50 to 1.00 after September 31, 2017, to be determined as of January 1 and July 1 of each year and (ii) minimum liquidity requirements.\nUpon issuance of the Convertible Second Lien Notes in October 2016, in accordance with accounting standards related to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion as well as warrants on the debt instrument, we recorded a debt discount of $11.0 million, thereby reducing the $40.0 million carrying value upon issuance to $29.0 million and recorded an equity component of $11.0 million. The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest rate method based upon an original term through August 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, $3.9 million of debt discount remains to be amortized on the Convertible Second Lien Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants within the Indenture that governs the Second Lien Notes.\nFuture Commitments\nThe table below (in thousands) provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at December 31, 2018. In addition to the contractual obligations presented in the table below, our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 reflects accrued interest on our bank debt of $0.4 million payable in the first quarter of 2019.

See a complete list in Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nProved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether the estimate is a deterministic estimate or probabilistic estimate. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimates if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us. We cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods.\nWhile the estimates of our proved reserves at December 31, 2018 included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the SEC rules, those estimates could differ materially from our actual results.\nFull Cost Accounting Method\nUnder U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), two acceptable methods of accounting for oil and gas properties are allowed. These are the Successful Efforts Method and the Full Cost Method. Entities engaged in the production of oil and gas have the option of selecting either method for application in the accounting for their properties. The principal differences between the two methods are in the treatment of exploration costs, the computation of DD&A expense and the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties.\nWe follow the Full Cost Method of Accounting. We believe that the true cost of developing a portfolio\u201d of reserves should reflect both successful and unsuccessful attempts at exploration and production. Application of the Full Cost Method of Accounting will better reflect the true economics of exploring for and developing our oil and gas reserves. Therefore, we use the Full Cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties in the reorganized company.\nUnder the Full Cost Method, we capitalize all costs associated with acquisitions, exploration, development and estimated abandonment costs. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with the acquisition of leasehold, as well as drilling and completion activities, but do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortization base until we make a determination as to the existence of proved reserves on the respective property. We review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs should be reclassified to proved oil and gas properties and therefore subject to DD&A. Our sales of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to net proved oil and gas properties with no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. Additionally, we capitalize a portion of the costs of interest incurred on our debt based upon the balance of our unevaluated property costs and our weighted-average borrowing rate.\nAll exploratory costs are capitalized, and DD&A expense is computed on cost centers represented by entire countries. Our oil and gas properties are subject to a ceiling test\u201d to assess for impairment, as discussed below, under the Full Cost Method.\nWe amortize our investment in oil and gas properties through DD&A expense using the units of production (the UOP\u201d) method. An amortization rate is calculated based on total proved reserves converted to equivalent thousand cubic feet of natural gas ( Mcfe\u201d) as the denominator and the net book value of evaluated oil and gas asset together with the estimated future development cost of the proved undeveloped reserves as the numerator. The rate calculated per Mcfe is applied against the periods' production also converted to Mcfe to arrive at the periods' DD&A expense.\nFull Cost Ceiling Test\nThe Full Cost Method requires that at the conclusion of each financial reporting period, the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (adjusted for hedges and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs), be compared to the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of related deferred taxes. This comparison is referred to as a ceiling test\u201d. If the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, we are required to write-down the value of our oil and gas properties to the value of the discounted cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves are calculated based on a 12-month average pricing assumption.\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We carry our derivative instruments at fair value and measure their fair value by applying the income approach provided for ASC 820, using Level 2 inputs based on third-party quotes or available interest rate information and commodity pricing data obtained from third party pricing sources and our credit worthiness or that of our counterparties. We carry our oil and natural gas properties held for use at historical cost or their estimated fair value if an impairment has been identified. We use Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable data such as discounted cash flow models or valuations, based on our various assumptions and future commodity prices to determine the fair value of our oil and natural gas properties in determining impairment. We carry cash and cash equivalents, account receivables and payables at carrying value which represent fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For definitions for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs see Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and natural gas properties in order to record the liability as required by the applicable accounting standard. This requirement necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that, in some cases, will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future. Such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements, technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us. We periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carry-forwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset, as well as a related valuation allowance, should be recognized in our financial statements.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. See Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Income Taxes and Note 7-Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nFor all new, modified and unvested share-based payment transactions with employees, we measure the fair value on the grant date and recognize it as compensation expense over the requisite period. Our common stock does not pay dividends; therefore, the dividend yield is zero.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-New Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements for any purpose.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, and the information set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of properties primarily in (i) Northwest Louisiana and East Texas, which includes the Haynesville Shale Trend (ii) Southwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana, which includes the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale Trend ( TMS\u201d), and (iii) South Texas, which includes the Eagle Ford Shale Trend.\nWe seek to increase shareholder value by growing our oil and natural gas reserves, production, revenues and cash flow from operating activities ( operating cash flow\u201d). In our opinion, on a long term basis, growth in oil and natural gas reserves, cash flow and production on a cost-effective basis are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and natural gas company.\nManagement strives to increase our oil and natural gas reserves, production and cash flow through exploration and development activities. We develop an annual capital expenditure budget, which is reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant. We take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing, such as bank debt, asset divestitures, issuance of debt and equity securities and strategic joint-ventures, when establishing our capital expenditure budget.\nWe place primary emphasis on our operating cash flow in managing our business. Management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income because operating cash flow considers only the cash expenses incurred during the period and excludes the non-cash impact of unrealized hedging gains (losses), non-cash general and administrative expenses and impairments.\nOur revenues and operating cash flow depend on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects with available capital, the volume and timing of our production, as well as commodity prices for oil and natural gas. Such pricing factors are largely beyond our control; however, we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is to provide long-term growth in reserves and cash flow on a cost-effective basis. We focus on maximizing our return on capital employed and adding reserve value through the timely development of our Haynesville Shale Trend acreage. We regularly evaluate possible acquisitions of prospective acreage and oil and natural gas drilling opportunities.\nSeveral of the key elements of our business strategy are the following:\nDevelop existing property base. We seek to maximize the value of our existing assets by developing and exploiting our properties that we have identified as having the lowest risk and the highest potential rates of return. To accomplish this strategy, we currently intend to develop our multi-year inventory of drilling locations and natural gas reserves on our Haynesville Shale Trend acreage.\nIncrease our natural gas production. We have concentrated on increasing our natural gas production and reserves by investing and drilling in the Haynesville Shale Trend. We intend to take advantage of improved completion technology to significantly increase production volume and consequently reduce our per unit finding cost and operating expenses.\nExpand acreage position in the Haynesville Shale Trend. As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 22,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale Trend. In addition to having significant experience in the play we intend to have significant operational control of our Haynesville Shale Trend assets. To leverage our extensive regional knowledge base, we seek to acquire leasehold acreage with significant drilling potential in areas that exhibit characteristics similar to our existing properties. We also continually strive to rationalize our portfolio of properties by selling marginal non-core properties in an effort to redeploy capital to exploitation, development and exploration projects that offer potentially higher overall returns.\nFocus on maximizing cash flow margins. We intend to maximize operating cash flow by focusing on higher-margin natural gas development in the Haynesville Shale Trend. In the current commodity price environment, our Haynesville Shale Trend assets offer more attractive rates of return on capital invested and cash flow margins than our oil assets.\nMaintain financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2018, we had $4.1 million in cash and a borrowing base of $75 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50 million, under our $250 million Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated October 17, 2017, by and between the Subsidiary, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, and certain lenders named therein (as amended, the 2017 Senior Credit Facility\u201d) on which we had $23 million available in borrowing capacity. We plan on funding growth primarily through operating cash flow. We actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives, including fixed price swaps and costless collars. The level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our view of market conditions, available hedge prices and our operating results.\nOverview of 2018 Results\n \u2022 We conducted drilling or completion operations on 19 wells, adding 16 gross (7.5 net) wells to production in the Haynesville Shale Trend; \n \u2022 We ended the year with 480 Bcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves with a PV-10 of $418 million; \u2022 We achieved an average daily equivalent production rate of 70,537 Mcfe per day representing a 112% increase from 2017; \n \u2022 We increased our oil and natural gas revenues to $87.9 million, representing an increase of 94% from 2017; \n \u2022 We generated net income of $1.8 million or $0.15 per share (basic) and $0.13 per share (diluted). \nHaynesville Shale Trend\nOur relatively low risk development acreage in this trend is primarily centered in Caddo, DeSoto and Red River parishes, Louisiana and Angelina and Nacogdoches counties, Texas. We held approximately 41,000 gross (22,600 net) acres as of December 31, 2018 producing from or prospective for the Haynesville Shale Trend. We incurred drilling or completion costs on 19 wells in 2018, spending $103.3 million of which $0.1 million was leasehold cost. We added 16 gross (7.5 net) wells to production in 2018. Our net production volumes from our Haynesville Shale Trend wells represented approximately 95% of our total equivalent production on a Mcfe basis and substantially all of our total natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTuscaloosa Marine Shale Trend\nWe held approximately 50,500 gross (35,100 net) acres in the TMS as of December 31, 2018 with approximately 47,600 gross (32,900 net) acres held by production. During 2018, we sold 3 gross (2.0 net) wells and did not conduct any drilling operations in the TMS; however, we had 2 gross (1.7 net) wells drilled in 2015, which are still waiting on completion. Our net production volumes from our TMS wells represented approximately 5% of our total equivalent production on a Mcfe basis and approximately 99% of our total oil production for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, we did not spend any capital in the TMS; however, we did spend $0.9 million on workover expense activities to maintain volumes on producing wells.\nEagle Ford Shale Trend\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have retained approximately 12,300 net acres of undeveloped leasehold in Frio County, Texas, which is prospective for future development or sale.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported net income of $1.8 million, or $0.15 per share (basic) and $0.13 per share (diluted), on oil and gas revenues of $87.9 million. This compares to a net loss of $8.0 million, or $0.80 per share (basic and diluted) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The recurring items that had the most material financial effect on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 were increased oil and gas revenues offset by increased transportation and processing cost, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization cost and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges. All of these items can be primarily attributed to our increased production volumes, and to a lesser extent the increase in prices.\nThe following table reflects our summary operating information for the periods presented in thousands except for price and volume data. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activity and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as indicative of future results.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Summary Operating Information:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and condensate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas, oil and condensate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Production:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas (Mmcf)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and condensate (MBbls)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total (Mmcfe)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily production (Mcfe/d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Realized Sales Price Per Unit:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas (per Mcf)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas (per Mcf) including the effect of realized gains/losses on derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and condensate (per Bbl)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and condensate (per Bbl) including the effect of realized gains/losses on derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average realized price (per Mcfe)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.31 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOil and Natural Gas Revenue\nNatural gas, oil and condensate revenues increased in 2018 compared to 2017 reflecting increases in our average realized sales prices for natural gas, oil and condensate and an increase in natural gas production, offset by decreased oil and condensate production. The increases in realized sales prices and in natural gas production contributed approximately $6.2 million and $42.3 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue. Decreased oil and condensate production reduced revenue by approximately $5.9 million compared to 2017. The increase in natural gas production volumes is attributed to 16 Haynesville Shale Trend wells put on production during 2018. We continue to concentrate our operational activities and resources on increasing natural gas production in the Haynesville Shale Trend.\nThe difference between our average realized prices inclusive of net cash derivative settlements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relates to our oil and natural gas contracts. In 2018, we paid a net $1.4 million on natural gas derivative settlements on a daily average of approximately 30,600 Mmbtu with a weighted average fixed price of $3.01 per Mmbtu and paid a net $1.9 million on oil derivative settlements on a daily average of 375 barrels at a weighted average price of $51.08 per barrel. In 2017, we had oil derivative settlements on 400 Bbls per day, only for the month of December 2017, at the fixed price of $51.08 per Bbl, and natural gas derivative settlements on a daily average of 15,008 Mmbtu with a weighted average price of $3.49 per Mmbtu. We received $0.6 million in natural gas derivative settlements from our counterparties and paid our counterparties $0.1 million in oil derivative settlements in 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,679 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production and other taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transportation and processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> Per Mcfe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.59 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production and other taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transportation and processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.08 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLease Operating Expense\nLease operating expense decreased $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period in 2017. The decrease is substantially attributed to decreased workover expense and lower per unit costs for new Haynesville Shale Trend wells compared to the same period in 2017, offset by increased costs due to an increased well count in 2018. We incurred $3.4 million in workover expense for the year in 2017 and only $1.4 million for the year in 2018. The majority of the workover expense incurred in 2018 is attributed to our TMS wells in the effort to maintain our oil production. Lease operating expense exclusive of workover expense on a per unit basis was $0.35 and $0.72 per Mcfe for the years 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect per unit lease operating expense to continue to decrease as we increase production from the Haynesville Shale Trend, which carries a lower per unit lease operating expense than our current per unit rate.\nProduction and Other Taxes\nProduction and other taxes for the year ended 2018 included severance tax of $1.8 million and ad valorem tax of $0.8 million. Severance taxes increased $0.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by expiration of our oil severance tax exemptions in Mississippi and Louisiana and to a lesser extent an increase in revenues. The State of Mississippi has enacted an exemption from the existing 6.0% severance tax for horizontal wells drilled after July 1, 2013 with production commencing before July 1, 2023, which is partially offset by a 1.3% local severance tax on such wells. The exemption is applicable until the earlier of (i) 30 months from the date of first sale of production or (ii) payout of the well. The State of Louisiana has also enacted an exemption from the existing 12.5% severance tax on oil and from the $0.098 per Mcf (through June 30, 2017), $0.111 per Mcf (from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018) and $0.122 per Mcf (starting on July 1, 2018) severance tax on natural gas for horizontal wells with production commencing after July 31, 1994. The exemption is applicable until the earlier of (i) 24 months from the date of first sale of production or (ii) payout of the well. Our recently drilled Haynesville Shale Trend natural gas wells in Northwest Louisiana are currently benefiting from this exemption.\nAd valorem tax increased $0.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Ad valorem tax in 2017 included audit refunds of approximately $0.9 million while no refunds were received in 2018.\nTransportation and Processing\nOur natural gas production incurs substantially all of our transportation and processing cost. Transportation and processing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased while per unit expense decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting increased production from our operated Haynesville Shale Trend wells. Our natural gas volumes from operated wells generally carry less transportation cost than those from wells we do not operate. Our per unit transportation cost will continue to decrease as we increase our operated natural gas production under more favorable transportation contracts.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion & amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General & administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> Per Mcfe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion & amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General & administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.61 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation, Depletion & Amortization ( DD&A\u201d)\nDD&A expense in 2018 and 2017 was calculated on the Full Cost Method of Accounting. We adjust our DD&A rates twice a year in conjunction with issuance of our year-end (for the fourth and first quarters) and mid-year (for the second and third quarters) reserve reports. DD&A increased in 2018 versus prior year as a result of an increase in the DD&A rate based on the year-end 2018 reserve report and also because of additional production volumes to which the DD&A rate was applied. Included in DD&A for 2018 is the depletion of our oil and gas properties of $26.2 million, accretion of our Asset Retirement Obligation of $0.3 million and $0.3 million in depreciation of our furniture and fixtures.\nImpairment\nOur Full Cost Ceiling Test performed quarterly did not require recording an impairment in 2018 or 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense ( G&A\u201d)\nGeneral and Administrative Expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $19.7 million which includes $6.4 million of share based compensation. The $3.0 million increase in G&A expense in 2018 compared to 2017 is attributed to a $2.0 million increase in share based compensation and $1.0 million increase in employee related expenses, including employee benefits costs and accrued performance bonuses. We capitalized $3.5 million of G&A directly attributed to our capital development to the full cost pool during 2018. Our G&A expense per unit of production decreased in 2018 and is expected to continue to decrease entirely due to our increasing production volumes. It is anticipated that share based compensation expense will also decrease as no substantial stock awards were granted during 2018.\nOur 2017 Senior Credit Facility and 13.50% Convertible Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the Convertible Second Lien Notes\u201d, for which the due date has been extended to March 30, 2020) placed limitations on cash general and administrative expenses through December 31, 2017 to $10.1 million. G&A payable in cash, which excluded share-based compensation, accrued performance bonus to be compensated in stock and accrued rent expense, was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We capitalized $2.4 million of G&A directly attributed to our capital development to the full cost pool during 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income (Expense):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,944 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,725 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(728 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,986 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,538 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(357 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reorganization items gain (loss), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(305 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(423 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(358 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(921 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(94 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average funded borrowings adjusted for debt discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average funded borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in 2018 included $1.1 million incurred on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility and $10.8 million incurred on the Convertible Second Lien Notes. The interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes was all non-cash consisting of $6.7 million in paid-in-kind interest and amortized debt discount of $4.1 million.\nInterest expense in 2017 included $1.2 million incurred on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility and Exit Credit Facility and $8.5 million incurred on the Convertible Second Lien Notes. The interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes was all non-cash consisting of $5.9 million in paid-in-kind interest and amortized debt discount of $2.6 million.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $0.5 million primarily related to sales tax refunds received on audits we performed on a contingency basis.\nInterest income and other for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $1.2 million primarily related to the receipt of cash that was released from escrow upon a negotiated settlement on longstanding title issues.\nGain/Loss on Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges\nWe produce and sell oil and natural gas into a market where prices are historically volatile. We enter into swap contracts, collars or other derivative agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to commodity price risk for a portion of our production. We do not designate our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. Consequently, the changes in our mark to market valuations are recorded directly to income or loss on our financial statements.\nLoss on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges in 2018 was comprised of a mark to market loss of $0.8 million and a loss of $3.2 million from net cash settlements. The mark to market loss represented a $2.7 million loss in the fair value of our natural gas derivative contracts offset by a $1.9 million gain in the fair value of our oil derivative contracts. The loss on cash settlements reflected a net $1.3 million paid to our counter-parties on settlement of our natural gas derivatives and a net $1.9 million paid to our counter-parties on settlement of oil derivatives.\nGain on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges in 2017 was comprised of a mark to market gain of $1.1 million and gain from net cash settlements of $0.5 million. The mark to market gain represented a $2.6 million gain in the fair value of our natural gas derivative contracts offset by a $1.5 million loss in the fair value of our oil derivative contracts. The net gain on cash settlements reflected $0.6 million cash received on settlement of our natural gas derivatives offset by $0.1 million payment on the settlement on our oil derivatives.\nReorganization items, net\nWe settled the final outstanding bankruptcy claims in 2018, which resulted in a net reorganization loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 including legal and trustee fees. We settled all remaining claims and closed our bankruptcy case in the third quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we distributed the remaining approximately 39 thousand shares of common stock and related warrants that were granted to the creditors per the Plan of Reorganization.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe recorded a $0.1 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a $1.0 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017. We maintained a valuation allowance at December 31, 2018, which resulted in no net deferred tax asset or liability appearing on our statement of financial position with the exception of a deferred tax asset related to alternative minimum tax ( AMT\u201d) credits. We recorded this valuation allowance after an evaluation of all available evidence (including our recent history of net operating losses in 2017 and prior years) that led to a conclusion that based upon the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature our deferred tax assets were unrecoverable. The income tax benefits recorded in 2018 and 2017 were due to the projected refund of AMT credits for which we also recorded a non-current deferred tax asset and a current receivable for the amount we expect to receive in 2019.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation known as the H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the Act\u201d), resulting in significant modifications to existing law. The Company completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during 2017. Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected certain effects of the Act which included a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, as well as other changes.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principle ( US GAAP\u201d) financial measure that is used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income and similar taxes, DD&A, share-based compensation expense and impairment of oil and natural gas properties (if any). In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, gains on reorganization, gains/losses on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges and net cash received or paid in settlement of derivative instruments are also excluded. Other excluded items include interest income and any extraordinary non-cash gains or losses. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by US GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), as defined by US GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-US GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the US GAAP measure of net income (loss), its most directly comparable measure presented in accordance with US GAAP:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) (US GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,996 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(978 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share based compensation expense (non-cash)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,863 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,725 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on reorganization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,552 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash received (paid) in settlement of derivative instruments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,236 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other items (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Other items include interest income and other, gain on sale of assets and other expense. \nManagement believes that this non-US GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors because it is monitored and used by our management and widely used by professional research analysts in the valuation and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly totaled measures of other companies.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur primary sources of cash during 2018 were cash on hand at the beginning of the year of $26.0 million, cash flow from operating activities of $49\ufeff.2 million, cash proceeds of $26.\ufeff8 million from asset sales and $10.3 million net cash draws under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We used $105.1 million in cash to fund our drilling and development capital program and used $3.1 million for purchases of treasury stock for tax withholding purposes related to stock compensation.\nOn October 17, 2017, we entered into the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, which provides for revolving loans of up to the borrowing base then in effect. Total lender commitments under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are $250 million subject to a borrowing base limitation, which as of December 31, 2018 was $75 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50 million. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures on a) October 17, 2021 or b) December 30, 2019, if the Convertible Second Lien Notes have not been voluntarily redeemed, repurchased, refinanced or otherwise retired by December 30, 2019. Revolving borrowings under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are limited to, and subject to periodic redeterminations of, the borrowing base. The amount of the borrowing base is determined by the lenders in their sole discretion and consistent with their oil and gas lending criteria at the time of the relevant redetermination. We may, however, elect to reduce the proposed borrowing base to a lower draw limit by providing notice to the lenders contemporaneously with each redetermination of the borrowing base. Pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, borrowing base redeterminations will be on a semi-annual basis on or about March 1st and September 1st of each calendar year. The borrowing base is subject to additional adjustments from time to time, including for asset sales, elimination or reduction of hedge positions and incurrence of other debt. Additionally, we and the administrative agent may request one unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base between scheduled redeterminations. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the lead lender and administrative agent under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nWe exited 2018 with $4.1 million of cash on hand and $27.0 million of outstanding borrowings with $23.0 million of availability under the current borrowing base of $50.0 million on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We are beginning 2019 with $27.1 million in immediately available capital resources.\nDue to the timing of payment of our capital expenditures and timing of borrowings under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility, we reflected a working capital deficit of $21.0 million as of December 31, 2018. To the extent we operate with a working capital deficit, we expect such deficit to be offset by the liquidity available under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nOutlook\nOur total capital expenditures for 2019 are expected to be approximately $90 to $100 million with flexibility to increase or decrease this amount based on the movement of commodity prices. We plan to focus all of our capital on drilling and development of our Haynesville Shale Trend natural gas properties in North Louisiana, and we currently contemplate drilling and developing 11 gross (9.8 net) wells utilizing improved completion techniques.\nWe believe the results of the capital investments we made in 2018 will generate additional cash flows and additional value that will allow us to raise capital to continue our capital development into 2019 and beyond.\nIn addition, to support future cash flows, we entered into strategic derivative positions as of December 31, 2018 covering approximately 53% of our anticipated oil and natural gas sales volumes for 2019. See Note 9- Derivative Activities\u201d in the Notes to consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe continuously monitor our balance sheet and coordinate our capital program with our expected cash flows and scheduled debt repayments. We will continue to evaluate funding alternatives as needed.\nAlternatives available to us include:\n \u2022 availability under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility; \n \u2022 issuance of equity securities; \n \u2022 issuance of debt securities; \n \u2022 joint ventures in our TMS and/or Haynesville Shale Trend acreage; and \n \u2022 sale of non-core assets. \nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> Cash flow statement information:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Cash:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(78,249 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,200 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(964 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,924 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,858 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018, our heavily weighted capital expenditures in the second half of 2018 resulted in a working capital deficit of $21.0 million, which was more than offset by the liquidity available under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We had approximately $76.8 million in long-term debt as of December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nOperating activities: Production from our wells, the price of oil and natural gas and operating costs represent the main drivers of our cash flow from operations. Changes in working capital and net cash settlements related to our derivative contracts also impacted cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $49.2 million including operating cash flows before working capital changes of $46.3 million reduced by net cash payments of $3.2 million for settlements of derivative contracts. The substantial increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to a 94% increase in oil and natural gas revenues driven by a 112% increase in equivalent production volumes.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflected cash expended on capital projects of $105.1 million reduced by $26.8 million cash proceeds received from sales of oil and gas properties. We recorded $106.9 million in capital expenditures in this period, which reflected the utilization of $1.2 million of cash calls paid in the previous period, the utilization of $1.9 million from materials inventory, capitalization of $0.4 million in asset retirement obligation and capitalization of $0.7 million of non-cash internal cost reduced by a net $2.4 million in the change of the capital expenditure accrual. We conducted drilling and completion operations on 19 gross (12.1 net) wells bringing 16 gross (7.5 net) wells on production in the Haynesville Shale Trend during the year ended December 31, 2018, and we capitalized $3.5 million in internal costs. We had 5 gross (4.6 net) wells waiting completion at December 31, 2018.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $7.1 million consisting of net draws of $10.3 million on the 2017 Senior credit facility reduced by $3.1 million for the purchase of shares withheld from employee stock awards for the payments of taxes and $0.1 million of debt issuance cost paid upon the amendment of the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $18.3 million. Production from our wells, the price of oil and natural gas and operating costs represented the main drivers of our cash flow from operations. In addition, net cash settlements of $0.5 million related to our derivative contracts and a $0.5 million change in working capital also positively impacted cash flows.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recorded $41.8 million in capital expenditures, of which we paid out cash amounts totaling $28.8 million for drilling and development operations in the year. The difference was attributed to the utilization of $0.4 million of cash calls paid in the previous period, the utilization of $1.8 million from materials inventory, $0.2 million in asset retirement obligation capitalized and a net $10.6 million increase in the capital expenditure accrual. The period also reflected the receipt of $0.6 million in proceeds from the sales of various non-producing mineral interests in non-core areas. We conducted drilling operations on 13 wells and completed 2 wells, all in the Haynesville Shale Trend, during the year ended December 31, 2017, and we capitalized $2.4 million in internal costs.\nFinancing activities: Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million consisting of $16.7 million payoff of the balance on the Exit Credit Facility, $0.3 million in registration and issuance costs associated with various securities issued since our emergence from bankruptcy or to be issued in the future, and $0.7 million in issuance cost incurred on the entering into the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, offset by the $16.7 million in proceeds from the new credit facility.\nDebt consisted of the following balances as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Carrying\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fair\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Carrying\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fair\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017 Senior Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,723 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Convertible Second Lien Notes (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,026 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The carrying amounts for the 2017 Senior Credit Facility represent fair value as it was fully secured. \n (2) The debt discount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method based upon a maturity date of August 30, 2019. The principal includes paid-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest of $13.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and $7.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The carrying value includes $3.9 million and $8.0 million of unamortized debt discount at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value of the notes was obtained by using the last known sale price for the value on December 31, 2018 and 2017. \nThe following table summarizes the total interest expense (contractual interest expense, amortization of debt discount, accretion and financing costs) and the effective interest rate on the liability component of the debt (amounts in thousands, except effective interest rates) for the periods ended:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Effective\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Effective\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interest\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exit Credit Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017 Senior Credit Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible Second Lien Notes (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $4.1 million of debt discount amortization and $6.7 million of PIK interest, and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $2.6 million of debt discount amortization and $5.8 million of PIK interest.\n2017 Senior Credit Facility\nOn October 17, 2017, the Company entered into the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, which provides for revolving loans of up to the borrowing base then in effect (as amended, the 2017 Senior Credit Facility\u201d). The 2017 Senior Credit Facility amends, restates and refinances the obligations under the Exit Credit Facility. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures (a) October 17, 2021 or (b) December 30, 2019, if the Convertible Second Lien Notes (as defined below) have not been voluntarily redeemed, repurchased, refinanced or otherwise retired by December 30, 2019. The maximum credit amount under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility is currently $250.0 million with a borrowing base of $75.0 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50.0 million. The borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined in March and September of each calendar year, and is subject to additional adjustments from time to time, including for asset sales, elimination or reduction of hedge positions and incurrence of other debt. Additionally, both the Subsidiary and the administrative agent may request one unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base between scheduled redeterminations. The amount of the borrowing base is determined by the lenders in their sole discretion and consistent with their oil and gas lending criteria at the time of the relevant redetermination. The Company may also request the issuance of letters of credit under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility in an aggregate amount up to $10.0 million, which reduce the amount of available borrowings under the borrowing base in the amount of such issued and outstanding letters of credit.\nAll amounts outstanding under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, either (i) the alternative base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base that is utilized, or (ii) adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin from 2.75% to 3.75%, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base that is utilized. Undrawn amounts under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are subject to a 0.50% commitment fee. To the extent that a payment default exists and is continuing, all amounts outstanding under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility will bear interest at 2.00% per annum above the rate and margin otherwise applicable thereto.\nThe 2017 Senior Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including (i) the maintenance of a ratio of Total Debt (as defined in the 2017 Senior Credit Facility) to EBITDAX not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, (ii) the maintenance of a current ratio (based on the ratio of current assets plus availability under the current borrowing base to current liabilities) not to be less than 1.00 to 1.00 and (iii) until no Convertible Second Lien Notes remain outstanding, (A) the maintenance of a ratio of Total Proved PV-10 attributable to the Company's and Borrower's Proved Reserves (as defined in the 2017 Senior Credit Facility) to Total Secured Debt (net of any Unrestricted Cash not to exceed $10.0 million) not to be less than 1.50 to 1.00, (B) minimum liquidity requirements.\nThe obligations under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company.\nConvertible Second Lien Notes\nOn October 12, 2016, upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company and the Subsidiary entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with each entity identified as a Shenkman Purchaser on Appendix A to the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the Shenkman Purchasers\u201d), CVC Capital Partners (acting through such of its affiliates to managed funds as it deems appropriate), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (acting through such of its affiliates or managed funds as it deems appropriate), Franklin Advisers, Inc. (as investment manager on behalf of certain funds and accounts), O'Connor Global Multi- Strategy Alpha Master Limited and Nineteen 77 Global Multi-Strategy Alpha (Levered) Master Limited (collectively, and together with each of their successors and assigns, the Purchasers\u201d), in connection with the issuance of $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 13.50% Convertible Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2019 ( Convertible Second Lien Notes\u201d).\nThe aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Second Lien Notes is convertible at the option of the Purchasers at any time prior to the scheduled maturity date at $21.33 per share representing 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock, subject to adjustments. At closing, the Purchasers were issued 10-year costless warrants equal to 2.5 million shares of common stock. Holders of the Convertible Second Lien Notes have a second priority lien on all assets of the Company, and have a continuing right to appoint two members to our Board of Directors as long as the Convertible Second Lien Notes are outstanding.\nThe Convertible Second Lien Notes, as set forth in the agreement, were to mature on August 30, 2019 or six months after the maturity of our current revolving credit facility but in no event later than March 30, 2020. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures no earlier than December 30, 2019; consequently, the Convertible Second Lien Notes will mature on March 30, 2020. The Convertible Second Lien Notes bear interest at the rate of 13.50% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The Company may elect to pay all or any portion of interest in-kind on the then outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Second Lien Notes by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Second Lien Notes or by issuing additional Second Lien Notes ( PIK Interest Notes\u201d). The PIK Interest Notes are not convertible. During such time as the Exit Credit Agreement (but not any refinancing or replacement thereof) is in effect, interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes must be paid in-kind; provided however, that after the quarter ending March 31, 2018, if (i) there is no default, event of default or borrowing base deficiency that has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the ratio of total debt to EBITDAX as defined under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility is less than 1.75 to 1.0 and (iii) the unused borrowing base is at least 25%, then the Company can pay the interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes in cash, at its election.\nThe Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes contains certain covenants pertaining to us and our subsidiary, including delivery of financial reports; environmental matters; conduct of business; use of proceeds; operation and maintenance of properties; collateral and guarantee requirements; indebtedness; liens; dividends and distributions; limits on sale of assets and stock; business activities; transactions with affiliates; and changes of control.\nThe Indenture also contains certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of (i) a Total Proved Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement) not to be less than 1.50 to 1.00 after September 31, 2017, to be determined as of January 1 and July 1 of each year and (ii) minimum liquidity requirements.\nUpon issuance of the Convertible Second Lien Notes in October 2016, in accordance with accounting standards related to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion as well as warrants on the debt instrument, we recorded a debt discount of $11.0 million, thereby reducing the $40.0 million carrying value upon issuance to $29.0 million and recorded an equity component of $11.0 million. The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest rate method based upon an original term through August 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, $3.9 million of debt discount remains to be amortized on the Convertible Second Lien Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants within the Indenture that governs the Second Lien Notes.\nFuture Commitments\nThe table below (in thousands) provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at December 31, 2018. In addition to the contractual obligations presented in the table below, our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 reflects accrued interest on our bank debt of $0.4 million payable in the first quarter of 2019.

See a complete list in Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nProved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether the estimate is a deterministic estimate or probabilistic estimate. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimates if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us. We cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods.\nWhile the estimates of our proved reserves at December 31, 2018 included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the SEC rules, those estimates could differ materially from our actual results.\nFull Cost Accounting Method\nUnder U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), two acceptable methods of accounting for oil and gas properties are allowed. These are the Successful Efforts Method and the Full Cost Method. Entities engaged in the production of oil and gas have the option of selecting either method for application in the accounting for their properties. The principal differences between the two methods are in the treatment of exploration costs, the computation of DD&A expense and the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties.\nWe follow the Full Cost Method of Accounting. We believe that the true cost of developing a portfolio\u201d of reserves should reflect both successful and unsuccessful attempts at exploration and production. Application of the Full Cost Method of Accounting will better reflect the true economics of exploring for and developing our oil and gas reserves. Therefore, we use the Full Cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties in the reorganized company.\nUnder the Full Cost Method, we capitalize all costs associated with acquisitions, exploration, development and estimated abandonment costs. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with the acquisition of leasehold, as well as drilling and completion activities, but do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortization base until we make a determination as to the existence of proved reserves on the respective property. We review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs should be reclassified to proved oil and gas properties and therefore subject to DD&A. Our sales of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to net proved oil and gas properties with no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. Additionally, we capitalize a portion of the costs of interest incurred on our debt based upon the balance of our unevaluated property costs and our weighted-average borrowing rate.\nAll exploratory costs are capitalized, and DD&A expense is computed on cost centers represented by entire countries. Our oil and gas properties are subject to a ceiling test\u201d to assess for impairment, as discussed below, under the Full Cost Method.\nWe amortize our investment in oil and gas properties through DD&A expense using the units of production (the UOP\u201d) method. An amortization rate is calculated based on total proved reserves converted to equivalent thousand cubic feet of natural gas ( Mcfe\u201d) as the denominator and the net book value of evaluated oil and gas asset together with the estimated future development cost of the proved undeveloped reserves as the numerator. The rate calculated per Mcfe is applied against the periods' production also converted to Mcfe to arrive at the periods' DD&A expense.\nFull Cost Ceiling Test\nThe Full Cost Method requires that at the conclusion of each financial reporting period, the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (adjusted for hedges and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs), be compared to the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of related deferred taxes. This comparison is referred to as a ceiling test\u201d. If the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, we are required to write-down the value of our oil and gas properties to the value of the discounted cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves are calculated based on a 12-month average pricing assumption.\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We carry our derivative instruments at fair value and measure their fair value by applying the income approach provided for ASC 820, using Level 2 inputs based on third-party quotes or available interest rate information and commodity pricing data obtained from third party pricing sources and our credit worthiness or that of our counterparties. We carry our oil and natural gas properties held for use at historical cost or their estimated fair value if an impairment has been identified. We use Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable data such as discounted cash flow models or valuations, based on our various assumptions and future commodity prices to determine the fair value of our oil and natural gas properties in determining impairment. We carry cash and cash equivalents, account receivables and payables at carrying value which represent fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For definitions for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs see Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and natural gas properties in order to record the liability as required by the applicable accounting standard. This requirement necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that, in some cases, will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future. Such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements, technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us. We periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carry-forwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset, as well as a related valuation allowance, should be recognized in our financial statements.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. See Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Income Taxes and Note 7-Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nFor all new, modified and unvested share-based payment transactions with employees, we measure the fair value on the grant date and recognize it as compensation expense over the requisite period. Our common stock does not pay dividends; therefore, the dividend yield is zero.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-New Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements for any purpose.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, and the information set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of properties primarily in (i) Northwest Louisiana and East Texas, which includes the Haynesville Shale Trend (ii) Southwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana, which includes the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale Trend ( TMS\u201d), and (iii) South Texas, which includes the Eagle Ford Shale Trend.\nWe seek to increase shareholder value by growing our oil and natural gas reserves, production, revenues and cash flow from operating activities ( operating cash flow\u201d). In our opinion, on a long term basis, growth in oil and natural gas reserves, cash flow and production on a cost-effective basis are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and natural gas company.\nManagement strives to increase our oil and natural gas reserves, production and cash flow through exploration and development activities. We develop an annual capital expenditure budget, which is reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant. We take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing, such as bank debt, asset divestitures, issuance of debt and equity securities and strategic joint-ventures, when establishing our capital expenditure budget.\nWe place primary emphasis on our operating cash flow in managing our business. Management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income because operating cash flow considers only the cash expenses incurred during the period and excludes the non-cash impact of unrealized hedging gains (losses), non-cash general and administrative expenses and impairments.\nOur revenues and operating cash flow depend on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects with available capital, the volume and timing of our production, as well as commodity prices for oil and natural gas. Such pricing factors are largely beyond our control; however, we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is to provide long-term growth in reserves and cash flow on a cost-effective basis. We focus on maximizing our return on capital employed and adding reserve value through the timely development of our Haynesville Shale Trend acreage. We regularly evaluate possible acquisitions of prospective acreage and oil and natural gas drilling opportunities.\nSeveral of the key elements of our business strategy are the following:\nDevelop existing property base. We seek to maximize the value of our existing assets by developing and exploiting our properties that we have identified as having the lowest risk and the highest potential rates of return. To accomplish this strategy, we currently intend to develop our multi-year inventory of drilling locations and natural gas reserves on our Haynesville Shale Trend acreage.\nIncrease our natural gas production. We have concentrated on increasing our natural gas production and reserves by investing and drilling in the Haynesville Shale Trend. We intend to take advantage of improved completion technology to significantly increase production volume and consequently reduce our per unit finding cost and operating expenses.\nExpand acreage position in the Haynesville Shale Trend. As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 22,600 net acres in the Haynesville Shale Trend. In addition to having significant experience in the play we intend to have significant operational control of our Haynesville Shale Trend assets. To leverage our extensive regional knowledge base, we seek to acquire leasehold acreage with significant drilling potential in areas that exhibit characteristics similar to our existing properties. We also continually strive to rationalize our portfolio of properties by selling marginal non-core properties in an effort to redeploy capital to exploitation, development and exploration projects that offer potentially higher overall returns.\nFocus on maximizing cash flow margins. We intend to maximize operating cash flow by focusing on higher-margin natural gas development in the Haynesville Shale Trend. In the current commodity price environment, our Haynesville Shale Trend assets offer more attractive rates of return on capital invested and cash flow margins than our oil assets.\nMaintain financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2018, we had $4.1 million in cash and a borrowing base of $75 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50 million, under our $250 million Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated October 17, 2017, by and between the Subsidiary, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, and certain lenders named therein (as amended, the 2017 Senior Credit Facility\u201d) on which we had $23 million available in borrowing capacity. We plan on funding growth primarily through operating cash flow. We actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives, including fixed price swaps and costless collars. The level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our view of market conditions, available hedge prices and our operating results.\nOverview of 2018 Results\n \u2022 We conducted drilling or completion operations on 19 wells, adding 16 gross (7.5 net) wells to production in the Haynesville Shale Trend; \n \u2022 We ended the year with 480 Bcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves with a PV-10 of $418 million; \u2022 We achieved an average daily equivalent production rate of 70,537 Mcfe per day representing a 112% increase from 2017; \n \u2022 We increased our oil and natural gas revenues to $87.9 million, representing an increase of 94% from 2017; \n \u2022 We generated net income of $1.8 million or $0.15 per share (basic) and $0.13 per share (diluted). \nHaynesville Shale Trend\nOur relatively low risk development acreage in this trend is primarily centered in Caddo, DeSoto and Red River parishes, Louisiana and Angelina and Nacogdoches counties, Texas. We held approximately 41,000 gross (22,600 net) acres as of December 31, 2018 producing from or prospective for the Haynesville Shale Trend. We incurred drilling or completion costs on 19 wells in 2018, spending $103.3 million of which $0.1 million was leasehold cost. We added 16 gross (7.5 net) wells to production in 2018. Our net production volumes from our Haynesville Shale Trend wells represented approximately 95% of our total equivalent production on a Mcfe basis and substantially all of our total natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTuscaloosa Marine Shale Trend\nWe held approximately 50,500 gross (35,100 net) acres in the TMS as of December 31, 2018 with approximately 47,600 gross (32,900 net) acres held by production. During 2018, we sold 3 gross (2.0 net) wells and did not conduct any drilling operations in the TMS; however, we had 2 gross (1.7 net) wells drilled in 2015, which are still waiting on completion. Our net production volumes from our TMS wells represented approximately 5% of our total equivalent production on a Mcfe basis and approximately 99% of our total oil production for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, we did not spend any capital in the TMS; however, we did spend $0.9 million on workover expense activities to maintain volumes on producing wells.\nEagle Ford Shale Trend\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have retained approximately 12,300 net acres of undeveloped leasehold in Frio County, Texas, which is prospective for future development or sale.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported net income of $1.8 million, or $0.15 per share (basic) and $0.13 per share (diluted), on oil and gas revenues of $87.9 million. This compares to a net loss of $8.0 million, or $0.80 per share (basic and diluted) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The recurring items that had the most material financial effect on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 were increased oil and gas revenues offset by increased transportation and processing cost, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization cost and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges. All of these items can be primarily attributed to our increased production volumes, and to a lesser extent the increase in prices.\nThe following table reflects our summary operating information for the periods presented in thousands except for price and volume data. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activity and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as indicative of future results.\n\nOil and Natural Gas Revenue\nNatural gas, oil and condensate revenues increased in 2018 compared to 2017 reflecting increases in our average realized sales prices for natural gas, oil and condensate and an increase in natural gas production, offset by decreased oil and condensate production. The increases in realized sales prices and in natural gas production contributed approximately $6.2 million and $42.3 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue. Decreased oil and condensate production reduced revenue by approximately $5.9 million compared to 2017. The increase in natural gas production volumes is attributed to 16 Haynesville Shale Trend wells put on production during 2018. We continue to concentrate our operational activities and resources on increasing natural gas production in the Haynesville Shale Trend.\nThe difference between our average realized prices inclusive of net cash derivative settlements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relates to our oil and natural gas contracts. In 2018, we paid a net $1.4 million on natural gas derivative settlements on a daily average of approximately 30,600 Mmbtu with a weighted average fixed price of $3.01 per Mmbtu and paid a net $1.9 million on oil derivative settlements on a daily average of 375 barrels at a weighted average price of $51.08 per barrel. In 2017, we had oil derivative settlements on 400 Bbls per day, only for the month of December 2017, at the fixed price of $51.08 per Bbl, and natural gas derivative settlements on a daily average of 15,008 Mmbtu with a weighted average price of $3.49 per Mmbtu. We received $0.6 million in natural gas derivative settlements from our counterparties and paid our counterparties $0.1 million in oil derivative settlements in 2017.\nOperating Expenses\n\n\nLease Operating Expense\nLease operating expense decreased $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period in 2017. The decrease is substantially attributed to decreased workover expense and lower per unit costs for new Haynesville Shale Trend wells compared to the same period in 2017, offset by increased costs due to an increased well count in 2018. We incurred $3.4 million in workover expense for the year in 2017 and only $1.4 million for the year in 2018. The majority of the workover expense incurred in 2018 is attributed to our TMS wells in the effort to maintain our oil production. Lease operating expense exclusive of workover expense on a per unit basis was $0.35 and $0.72 per Mcfe for the years 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect per unit lease operating expense to continue to decrease as we increase production from the Haynesville Shale Trend, which carries a lower per unit lease operating expense than our current per unit rate.\nProduction and Other Taxes\nProduction and other taxes for the year ended 2018 included severance tax of $1.8 million and ad valorem tax of $0.8 million. Severance taxes increased $0.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by expiration of our oil severance tax exemptions in Mississippi and Louisiana and to a lesser extent an increase in revenues. The State of Mississippi has enacted an exemption from the existing 6.0% severance tax for horizontal wells drilled after July 1, 2013 with production commencing before July 1, 2023, which is partially offset by a 1.3% local severance tax on such wells. The exemption is applicable until the earlier of (i) 30 months from the date of first sale of production or (ii) payout of the well. The State of Louisiana has also enacted an exemption from the existing 12.5% severance tax on oil and from the $0.098 per Mcf (through June 30, 2017), $0.111 per Mcf (from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018) and $0.122 per Mcf (starting on July 1, 2018) severance tax on natural gas for horizontal wells with production commencing after July 31, 1994. The exemption is applicable until the earlier of (i) 24 months from the date of first sale of production or (ii) payout of the well. Our recently drilled Haynesville Shale Trend natural gas wells in Northwest Louisiana are currently benefiting from this exemption.\nAd valorem tax increased $0.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Ad valorem tax in 2017 included audit refunds of approximately $0.9 million while no refunds were received in 2018.\nTransportation and Processing\nOur natural gas production incurs substantially all of our transportation and processing cost. Transportation and processing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased while per unit expense decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting increased production from our operated Haynesville Shale Trend wells. Our natural gas volumes from operated wells generally carry less transportation cost than those from wells we do not operate. Our per unit transportation cost will continue to decrease as we increase our operated natural gas production under more favorable transportation contracts.\n\n\nDepreciation, Depletion & Amortization ( DD&A\u201d)\nDD&A expense in 2018 and 2017 was calculated on the Full Cost Method of Accounting. We adjust our DD&A rates twice a year in conjunction with issuance of our year-end (for the fourth and first quarters) and mid-year (for the second and third quarters) reserve reports. DD&A increased in 2018 versus prior year as a result of an increase in the DD&A rate based on the year-end 2018 reserve report and also because of additional production volumes to which the DD&A rate was applied. Included in DD&A for 2018 is the depletion of our oil and gas properties of $26.2 million, accretion of our Asset Retirement Obligation of $0.3 million and $0.3 million in depreciation of our furniture and fixtures.\nImpairment\nOur Full Cost Ceiling Test performed quarterly did not require recording an impairment in 2018 or 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense ( G&A\u201d)\nGeneral and Administrative Expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $19.7 million which includes $6.4 million of share based compensation. The $3.0 million increase in G&A expense in 2018 compared to 2017 is attributed to a $2.0 million increase in share based compensation and $1.0 million increase in employee related expenses, including employee benefits costs and accrued performance bonuses. We capitalized $3.5 million of G&A directly attributed to our capital development to the full cost pool during 2018. Our G&A expense per unit of production decreased in 2018 and is expected to continue to decrease entirely due to our increasing production volumes. It is anticipated that share based compensation expense will also decrease as no substantial stock awards were granted during 2018.\nOur 2017 Senior Credit Facility and 13.50% Convertible Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the Convertible Second Lien Notes\u201d, for which the due date has been extended to March 30, 2020) placed limitations on cash general and administrative expenses through December 31, 2017 to $10.1 million. G&A payable in cash, which excluded share-based compensation, accrued performance bonus to be compensated in stock and accrued rent expense, was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We capitalized $2.4 million of G&A directly attributed to our capital development to the full cost pool during 2017.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in 2018 included $1.1 million incurred on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility and $10.8 million incurred on the Convertible Second Lien Notes. The interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes was all non-cash consisting of $6.7 million in paid-in-kind interest and amortized debt discount of $4.1 million.\nInterest expense in 2017 included $1.2 million incurred on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility and Exit Credit Facility and $8.5 million incurred on the Convertible Second Lien Notes. The interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes was all non-cash consisting of $5.9 million in paid-in-kind interest and amortized debt discount of $2.6 million.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $0.5 million primarily related to sales tax refunds received on audits we performed on a contingency basis.\nInterest income and other for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $1.2 million primarily related to the receipt of cash that was released from escrow upon a negotiated settlement on longstanding title issues.\nGain/Loss on Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges\nWe produce and sell oil and natural gas into a market where prices are historically volatile. We enter into swap contracts, collars or other derivative agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to commodity price risk for a portion of our production. We do not designate our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. Consequently, the changes in our mark to market valuations are recorded directly to income or loss on our financial statements.\nLoss on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges in 2018 was comprised of a mark to market loss of $0.8 million and a loss of $3.2 million from net cash settlements. The mark to market loss represented a $2.7 million loss in the fair value of our natural gas derivative contracts offset by a $1.9 million gain in the fair value of our oil derivative contracts. The loss on cash settlements reflected a net $1.3 million paid to our counter-parties on settlement of our natural gas derivatives and a net $1.9 million paid to our counter-parties on settlement of oil derivatives.\nGain on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges in 2017 was comprised of a mark to market gain of $1.1 million and gain from net cash settlements of $0.5 million. The mark to market gain represented a $2.6 million gain in the fair value of our natural gas derivative contracts offset by a $1.5 million loss in the fair value of our oil derivative contracts. The net gain on cash settlements reflected $0.6 million cash received on settlement of our natural gas derivatives offset by $0.1 million payment on the settlement on our oil derivatives.\nReorganization items, net\nWe settled the final outstanding bankruptcy claims in 2018, which resulted in a net reorganization loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 including legal and trustee fees. We settled all remaining claims and closed our bankruptcy case in the third quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we distributed the remaining approximately 39 thousand shares of common stock and related warrants that were granted to the creditors per the Plan of Reorganization.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe recorded a $0.1 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a $1.0 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017. We maintained a valuation allowance at December 31, 2018, which resulted in no net deferred tax asset or liability appearing on our statement of financial position with the exception of a deferred tax asset related to alternative minimum tax ( AMT\u201d) credits. We recorded this valuation allowance after an evaluation of all available evidence (including our recent history of net operating losses in 2017 and prior years) that led to a conclusion that based upon the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature our deferred tax assets were unrecoverable. The income tax benefits recorded in 2018 and 2017 were due to the projected refund of AMT credits for which we also recorded a non-current deferred tax asset and a current receivable for the amount we expect to receive in 2019.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation known as the H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the Act\u201d), resulting in significant modifications to existing law. The Company completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during 2017. Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected certain effects of the Act which included a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, as well as other changes.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principle ( US GAAP\u201d) financial measure that is used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income and similar taxes, DD&A, share-based compensation expense and impairment of oil and natural gas properties (if any). In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, gains on reorganization, gains/losses on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges and net cash received or paid in settlement of derivative instruments are also excluded. Other excluded items include interest income and any extraordinary non-cash gains or losses. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by US GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), as defined by US GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-US GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the US GAAP measure of net income (loss), its most directly comparable measure presented in accordance with US GAAP:\n\n (1) Other items include interest income and other, gain on sale of assets and other expense. \nManagement believes that this non-US GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors because it is monitored and used by our management and widely used by professional research analysts in the valuation and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly totaled measures of other companies.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur primary sources of cash during 2018 were cash on hand at the beginning of the year of $26.0 million, cash flow from operating activities of $49\ufeff.2 million, cash proceeds of $26.\ufeff8 million from asset sales and $10.3 million net cash draws under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We used $105.1 million in cash to fund our drilling and development capital program and used $3.1 million for purchases of treasury stock for tax withholding purposes related to stock compensation.\nOn October 17, 2017, we entered into the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, which provides for revolving loans of up to the borrowing base then in effect. Total lender commitments under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are $250 million subject to a borrowing base limitation, which as of December 31, 2018 was $75 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50 million. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures on a) October 17, 2021 or b) December 30, 2019, if the Convertible Second Lien Notes have not been voluntarily redeemed, repurchased, refinanced or otherwise retired by December 30, 2019. Revolving borrowings under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are limited to, and subject to periodic redeterminations of, the borrowing base. The amount of the borrowing base is determined by the lenders in their sole discretion and consistent with their oil and gas lending criteria at the time of the relevant redetermination. We may, however, elect to reduce the proposed borrowing base to a lower draw limit by providing notice to the lenders contemporaneously with each redetermination of the borrowing base. Pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, borrowing base redeterminations will be on a semi-annual basis on or about March 1st and September 1st of each calendar year. The borrowing base is subject to additional adjustments from time to time, including for asset sales, elimination or reduction of hedge positions and incurrence of other debt. Additionally, we and the administrative agent may request one unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base between scheduled redeterminations. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the lead lender and administrative agent under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nWe exited 2018 with $4.1 million of cash on hand and $27.0 million of outstanding borrowings with $23.0 million of availability under the current borrowing base of $50.0 million on the 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We are beginning 2019 with $27.1 million in immediately available capital resources.\nDue to the timing of payment of our capital expenditures and timing of borrowings under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility, we reflected a working capital deficit of $21.0 million as of December 31, 2018. To the extent we operate with a working capital deficit, we expect such deficit to be offset by the liquidity available under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nOutlook\nOur total capital expenditures for 2019 are expected to be approximately $90 to $100 million with flexibility to increase or decrease this amount based on the movement of commodity prices. We plan to focus all of our capital on drilling and development of our Haynesville Shale Trend natural gas properties in North Louisiana, and we currently contemplate drilling and developing 11 gross (9.8 net) wells utilizing improved completion techniques.\nWe believe the results of the capital investments we made in 2018 will generate additional cash flows and additional value that will allow us to raise capital to continue our capital development into 2019 and beyond.\nIn addition, to support future cash flows, we entered into strategic derivative positions as of December 31, 2018 covering approximately 53% of our anticipated oil and natural gas sales volumes for 2019. See Note 9- Derivative Activities\u201d in the Notes to consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe continuously monitor our balance sheet and coordinate our capital program with our expected cash flows and scheduled debt repayments. We will continue to evaluate funding alternatives as needed.\nAlternatives available to us include:\n \u2022 availability under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility; \n \u2022 issuance of equity securities; \n \u2022 issuance of debt securities; \n \u2022 joint ventures in our TMS and/or Haynesville Shale Trend acreage; and \n \u2022 sale of non-core assets. \nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nAt December 31, 2018, our heavily weighted capital expenditures in the second half of 2018 resulted in a working capital deficit of $21.0 million, which was more than offset by the liquidity available under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility. We had approximately $76.8 million in long-term debt as of December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nOperating activities: Production from our wells, the price of oil and natural gas and operating costs represent the main drivers of our cash flow from operations. Changes in working capital and net cash settlements related to our derivative contracts also impacted cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $49.2 million including operating cash flows before working capital changes of $46.3 million reduced by net cash payments of $3.2 million for settlements of derivative contracts. The substantial increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to a 94% increase in oil and natural gas revenues driven by a 112% increase in equivalent production volumes.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflected cash expended on capital projects of $105.1 million reduced by $26.8 million cash proceeds received from sales of oil and gas properties. We recorded $106.9 million in capital expenditures in this period, which reflected the utilization of $1.2 million of cash calls paid in the previous period, the utilization of $1.9 million from materials inventory, capitalization of $0.4 million in asset retirement obligation and capitalization of $0.7 million of non-cash internal cost reduced by a net $2.4 million in the change of the capital expenditure accrual. We conducted drilling and completion operations on 19 gross (12.1 net) wells bringing 16 gross (7.5 net) wells on production in the Haynesville Shale Trend during the year ended December 31, 2018, and we capitalized $3.5 million in internal costs. We had 5 gross (4.6 net) wells waiting completion at December 31, 2018.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $7.1 million consisting of net draws of $10.3 million on the 2017 Senior credit facility reduced by $3.1 million for the purchase of shares withheld from employee stock awards for the payments of taxes and $0.1 million of debt issuance cost paid upon the amendment of the 2017 Senior Credit Facility.\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $18.3 million. Production from our wells, the price of oil and natural gas and operating costs represented the main drivers of our cash flow from operations. In addition, net cash settlements of $0.5 million related to our derivative contracts and a $0.5 million change in working capital also positively impacted cash flows.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recorded $41.8 million in capital expenditures, of which we paid out cash amounts totaling $28.8 million for drilling and development operations in the year. The difference was attributed to the utilization of $0.4 million of cash calls paid in the previous period, the utilization of $1.8 million from materials inventory, $0.2 million in asset retirement obligation capitalized and a net $10.6 million increase in the capital expenditure accrual. The period also reflected the receipt of $0.6 million in proceeds from the sales of various non-producing mineral interests in non-core areas. We conducted drilling operations on 13 wells and completed 2 wells, all in the Haynesville Shale Trend, during the year ended December 31, 2017, and we capitalized $2.4 million in internal costs.\nFinancing activities: Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million consisting of $16.7 million payoff of the balance on the Exit Credit Facility, $0.3 million in registration and issuance costs associated with various securities issued since our emergence from bankruptcy or to be issued in the future, and $0.7 million in issuance cost incurred on the entering into the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, offset by the $16.7 million in proceeds from the new credit facility.\nDebt consisted of the following balances as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\n\n (1) The carrying amounts for the 2017 Senior Credit Facility represent fair value as it was fully secured. \n (2) The debt discount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method based upon a maturity date of August 30, 2019. The principal includes paid-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest of $13.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and $7.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The carrying value includes $3.9 million and $8.0 million of unamortized debt discount at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value of the notes was obtained by using the last known sale price for the value on December 31, 2018 and 2017. \nThe following table summarizes the total interest expense (contractual interest expense, amortization of debt discount, accretion and financing costs) and the effective interest rate on the liability component of the debt (amounts in thousands, except effective interest rates) for the periods ended:\n\n(1) Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $4.1 million of debt discount amortization and $6.7 million of PIK interest, and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $2.6 million of debt discount amortization and $5.8 million of PIK interest.\n2017 Senior Credit Facility\nOn October 17, 2017, the Company entered into the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, which provides for revolving loans of up to the borrowing base then in effect (as amended, the 2017 Senior Credit Facility\u201d). The 2017 Senior Credit Facility amends, restates and refinances the obligations under the Exit Credit Facility. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures (a) October 17, 2021 or (b) December 30, 2019, if the Convertible Second Lien Notes (as defined below) have not been voluntarily redeemed, repurchased, refinanced or otherwise retired by December 30, 2019. The maximum credit amount under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility is currently $250.0 million with a borrowing base of $75.0 million, subject to an elected draw limit of $50.0 million. The borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined in March and September of each calendar year, and is subject to additional adjustments from time to time, including for asset sales, elimination or reduction of hedge positions and incurrence of other debt. Additionally, both the Subsidiary and the administrative agent may request one unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base between scheduled redeterminations. The amount of the borrowing base is determined by the lenders in their sole discretion and consistent with their oil and gas lending criteria at the time of the relevant redetermination. The Company may also request the issuance of letters of credit under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility in an aggregate amount up to $10.0 million, which reduce the amount of available borrowings under the borrowing base in the amount of such issued and outstanding letters of credit.\nAll amounts outstanding under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, either (i) the alternative base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base that is utilized, or (ii) adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin from 2.75% to 3.75%, depending on the percentage of the borrowing base that is utilized. Undrawn amounts under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are subject to a 0.50% commitment fee. To the extent that a payment default exists and is continuing, all amounts outstanding under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility will bear interest at 2.00% per annum above the rate and margin otherwise applicable thereto.\nThe 2017 Senior Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including (i) the maintenance of a ratio of Total Debt (as defined in the 2017 Senior Credit Facility) to EBITDAX not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, (ii) the maintenance of a current ratio (based on the ratio of current assets plus availability under the current borrowing base to current liabilities) not to be less than 1.00 to 1.00 and (iii) until no Convertible Second Lien Notes remain outstanding, (A) the maintenance of a ratio of Total Proved PV-10 attributable to the Company's and Borrower's Proved Reserves (as defined in the 2017 Senior Credit Facility) to Total Secured Debt (net of any Unrestricted Cash not to exceed $10.0 million) not to be less than 1.50 to 1.00, (B) minimum liquidity requirements.\nThe obligations under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company.\nConvertible Second Lien Notes\nOn October 12, 2016, upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company and the Subsidiary entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with each entity identified as a Shenkman Purchaser on Appendix A to the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the Shenkman Purchasers\u201d), CVC Capital Partners (acting through such of its affiliates to managed funds as it deems appropriate), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (acting through such of its affiliates or managed funds as it deems appropriate), Franklin Advisers, Inc. (as investment manager on behalf of certain funds and accounts), O'Connor Global Multi- Strategy Alpha Master Limited and Nineteen 77 Global Multi-Strategy Alpha (Levered) Master Limited (collectively, and together with each of their successors and assigns, the Purchasers\u201d), in connection with the issuance of $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 13.50% Convertible Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2019 ( Convertible Second Lien Notes\u201d).\nThe aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Second Lien Notes is convertible at the option of the Purchasers at any time prior to the scheduled maturity date at $21.33 per share representing 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock, subject to adjustments. At closing, the Purchasers were issued 10-year costless warrants equal to 2.5 million shares of common stock. Holders of the Convertible Second Lien Notes have a second priority lien on all assets of the Company, and have a continuing right to appoint two members to our Board of Directors as long as the Convertible Second Lien Notes are outstanding.\nThe Convertible Second Lien Notes, as set forth in the agreement, were to mature on August 30, 2019 or six months after the maturity of our current revolving credit facility but in no event later than March 30, 2020. The 2017 Senior Credit Facility matures no earlier than December 30, 2019; consequently, the Convertible Second Lien Notes will mature on March 30, 2020. The Convertible Second Lien Notes bear interest at the rate of 13.50% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The Company may elect to pay all or any portion of interest in-kind on the then outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Second Lien Notes by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Second Lien Notes or by issuing additional Second Lien Notes ( PIK Interest Notes\u201d). The PIK Interest Notes are not convertible. During such time as the Exit Credit Agreement (but not any refinancing or replacement thereof) is in effect, interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes must be paid in-kind; provided however, that after the quarter ending March 31, 2018, if (i) there is no default, event of default or borrowing base deficiency that has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the ratio of total debt to EBITDAX as defined under the 2017 Senior Credit Facility is less than 1.75 to 1.0 and (iii) the unused borrowing base is at least 25%, then the Company can pay the interest on the Convertible Second Lien Notes in cash, at its election.\nThe Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes contains certain covenants pertaining to us and our subsidiary, including delivery of financial reports; environmental matters; conduct of business; use of proceeds; operation and maintenance of properties; collateral and guarantee requirements; indebtedness; liens; dividends and distributions; limits on sale of assets and stock; business activities; transactions with affiliates; and changes of control.\nThe Indenture also contains certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of (i) a Total Proved Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement) not to be less than 1.50 to 1.00 after September 31, 2017, to be determined as of January 1 and July 1 of each year and (ii) minimum liquidity requirements.\nUpon issuance of the Convertible Second Lien Notes in October 2016, in accordance with accounting standards related to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion as well as warrants on the debt instrument, we recorded a debt discount of $11.0 million, thereby reducing the $40.0 million carrying value upon issuance to $29.0 million and recorded an equity component of $11.0 million. The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest rate method based upon an original term through August 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, $3.9 million of debt discount remains to be amortized on the Convertible Second Lien Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants within the Indenture that governs the Second Lien Notes.\nFuture Commitments\nThe table below (in thousands) provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at December 31, 2018. In addition to the contractual obligations presented in the table below, our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 reflects accrued interest on our bank debt of $0.4 million payable in the first quarter of 2019. For additional information see Note 5-Debt and Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n \n (1) This table does not include the estimated liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and natural gas properties of $3.8 million as of December 31, 2018. We record a separate liability for the asset retirement obligations. See Note 4-Asset Retirement Obligation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies. See a complete list in Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nProved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether the estimate is a deterministic estimate or probabilistic estimate. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimates if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us. We cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods.\nWhile the estimates of our proved reserves at December 31, 2018 included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the SEC rules, those estimates could differ materially from our actual results.\nFull Cost Accounting Method\nUnder U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), two acceptable methods of accounting for oil and gas properties are allowed. These are the Successful Efforts Method and the Full Cost Method. Entities engaged in the production of oil and gas have the option of selecting either method for application in the accounting for their properties. The principal differences between the two methods are in the treatment of exploration costs, the computation of DD&A expense and the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties.\nWe follow the Full Cost Method of Accounting. We believe that the true cost of developing a portfolio\u201d of reserves should reflect both successful and unsuccessful attempts at exploration and production. Application of the Full Cost Method of Accounting will better reflect the true economics of exploring for and developing our oil and gas reserves. Therefore, we use the Full Cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties in the reorganized company.\nUnder the Full Cost Method, we capitalize all costs associated with acquisitions, exploration, development and estimated abandonment costs. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with the acquisition of leasehold, as well as drilling and completion activities, but do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortization base until we make a determination as to the existence of proved reserves on the respective property. We review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs should be reclassified to proved oil and gas properties and therefore subject to DD&A. Our sales of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to net proved oil and gas properties with no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. Additionally, we capitalize a portion of the costs of interest incurred on our debt based upon the balance of our unevaluated property costs and our weighted-average borrowing rate.\nAll exploratory costs are capitalized, and DD&A expense is computed on cost centers represented by entire countries. Our oil and gas properties are subject to a ceiling test\u201d to assess for impairment, as discussed below, under the Full Cost Method.\nWe amortize our investment in oil and gas properties through DD&A expense using the units of production (the UOP\u201d) method. An amortization rate is calculated based on total proved reserves converted to equivalent thousand cubic feet of natural gas ( Mcfe\u201d) as the denominator and the net book value of evaluated oil and gas asset together with the estimated future development cost of the proved undeveloped reserves as the numerator. The rate calculated per Mcfe is applied against the periods' production also converted to Mcfe to arrive at the periods' DD&A expense.\nFull Cost Ceiling Test\nThe Full Cost Method requires that at the conclusion of each financial reporting period, the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (adjusted for hedges and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs), be compared to the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of related deferred taxes. This comparison is referred to as a ceiling test\u201d. If the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, we are required to write-down the value of our oil and gas properties to the value of the discounted cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves are calculated based on a 12-month average pricing assumption.\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We carry our derivative instruments at fair value and measure their fair value by applying the income approach provided for ASC 820, using Level 2 inputs based on third-party quotes or available interest rate information and commodity pricing data obtained from third party pricing sources and our credit worthiness or that of our counterparties. We carry our oil and natural gas properties held for use at historical cost or their estimated fair value if an impairment has been identified. We use Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable data such as discounted cash flow models or valuations, based on our various assumptions and future commodity prices to determine the fair value of our oil and natural gas properties in determining impairment. We carry cash and cash equivalents, account receivables and payables at carrying value which represent fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For definitions for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs see Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and natural gas properties in order to record the liability as required by the applicable accounting standard. This requirement necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that, in some cases, will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future. Such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements, technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us. We periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carry-forwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset, as well as a related valuation allowance, should be recognized in our financial statements.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. See Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Income Taxes and Note 7-Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nFor all new, modified and unvested share-based payment transactions with employees, we measure the fair value on the grant date and recognize it as compensation expense over the requisite period. Our common stock does not pay dividends; therefore, the dividend yield is zero.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1-Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-New Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements for any purpose.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year
