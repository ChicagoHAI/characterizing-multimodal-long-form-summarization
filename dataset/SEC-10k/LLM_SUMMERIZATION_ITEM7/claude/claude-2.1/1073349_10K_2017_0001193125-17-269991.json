Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data and the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Annual Report that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Without limiting the foregoing, the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, intends, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us up to and including the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. You should carefully review those factors and also carefully review the risks outlined in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn the management discussion that follows we have highlighted those changes and operating factors that were the primary factors affecting period to period fluctuations. The remainder of the change in period to period fluctuations from that which is specifically discussed arises from various individually insignificant items.\nOverview\nWe help businesses pay and get paid. We make complex business payments simple, smart and secure by providing a trusted and easy-to-use set of cloud-based business payment, digital banking, fraud prevention, payment and financial document solutions. We offer cloud solutions, as well as software designed to run on-site at the customer's location. The majority of our revenues are derived from offerings sold as SaaS-based solutions and paid for on a subscription and transaction basis.\nWe operate cloud-based settlement networks that facilitate electronic payments and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. We offer cloud and on-premise solutions that banks use to provide payment, cash management and treasury capabilities to their business customers, as well as solutions that banks and credit unions use to facilitate customer acquisition and growth. We offer legal spend management solutions that help manage and determine the right amount to pay for legal services and claims vendor expenditures for insurance companies and other large corporate consumers of outside legal services. Our corporate customers rely on our solutions to automate their payment and accounts payable processes and to streamline and manage the production and retention of electronic documents. Our healthcare customers use our solutions to streamline financial processes, particularly the patient enrollment process. We also offer comprehensive cyber fraud and risk management solutions that are designed to non-invasively monitor and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag behavioral and data anomalies and other suspicious activity.\nOur solutions are designed to complement, leverage and extend our customers' existing information systems, accounting applications and banking relationships so that they can be deployed quickly and efficiently. To help our customers realize the maximum value from our products and meet their specific business requirements, we also provide professional services for installation, training, consulting and product enhancement.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor fiscal year 2017, our revenue increased to $349.4 million from $343.3 million in the prior year. Our revenue for fiscal year 2017 was unfavorably impacted by $14.0 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound Sterling that depreciated against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior year. The revenue increase, inclusive of foreign exchange impacts, was attributable to revenue increases in our Cloud Solutions segment of $16.2 million and Digital Banking segment of $8.5 million,\noffset by decreased revenue in our Payments and Transactional Documents segment of $17.1 million and Other segment of $1.5 million. Increased revenue from our legal spend management and settlement network solutions accounted for the revenue increase in our Cloud Solutions segment. The Digital Banking segment's revenue increase was primarily due to increased subscription and transaction revenue from our cloud based solutions. The revenue decrease in our Payments and Transactional Documents segment was related to lower European and North American software license revenue and lower service and maintenance revenue in our payment and document automation products.\nWe incurred a net loss of $33.1 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to a net loss of $19.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Our net loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was affected by the impact of decreased gross margins of $8.6 million and increased operating expenses of $9.0 million. The decrease in gross margins was primarily driven by decreases in revenue in our Payments and Transactional Documents and Other segments. The increase in our operating expenses was due primarily to a goodwill impairment charge of $7.5 million that we recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and increased global enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation costs which did not qualify for capitalization of $4.6 million. Our operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were favorably impacted by $4.9 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound Sterling which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior year.\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we derived approximately 37% of our revenue from customers located outside of North America, principally in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWe expect future revenue growth to be driven by our digital banking, legal spend management and settlement network solutions.\nOver the past several years we have made strategic investments in innovative new technology offerings that we believe will enhance our competitive position, help us win new business, drive subscription revenue growth and expand our operating margins. We believe that these initiatives have positioned us effectively for revenue growth in future years.\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn December 9, 2016, we (as borrower) and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (as guarantors) entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders. Please refer to Note 10 Indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nRevenue Sources\nOur revenues are derived from multiple sources and are reported under the following classifications:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Subscriptions and Transactions Fees. We derive subscription and transaction fees from a number of sources, principally our SaaS offerings. Subscription revenues are typically recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. Transaction revenues are typically recorded at the time transactions are processed. Some of our SaaS products require customers to pay non-refundable set up or installation fees. In these cases, since the up-front fees do not represent a separate revenue earnings process, these fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is generally between five and ten years. A significant part of our focus remains on growing the revenue contribution from our SaaS offerings and subscriptions and transactions based revenue streams. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Software License Fees. Software license revenues, which we derive from our software applications, are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased. Fees from the sale of perpetual software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer, assuming that payment from the customer is probable and there are no extended payment terms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> However, certain of our software arrangements, particularly those related to financial institution customers, are recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project because they require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. Recently however, the number of percentage of completion arrangements we enter into has declined as we have continued to de-emphasize large, highly customized projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Service and Maintenance Fees. Our service and maintenance revenues consist of professional services fees and customer support and maintenance fees. Revenues relating to professional services not associated with highly customized software solutions are normally recognized at the time services are rendered. Professional services revenues associated with software license arrangements that include significant customization and modification are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project. Software maintenance fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the respective maintenance period, which is typically one year. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Other Revenues. We derive other revenues from the sale of printers, check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners. These revenues are normally recognized at the time of delivery. </td> </tr>\n</table> Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates - which also would have been reasonable - could have been used. These critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, the valuation of acquired deferred revenue and income taxes. These critical policies and our procedures related to these policies are discussed below. In addition, refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nRevenue Recognition\nSoftware Arrangements\nWe recognize revenue on our software license arrangements when four basic criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable. We consider a fully executed agreement or a customer purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Delivery is deemed to have occurred upon transfer of the product to the customer or the completion of services rendered. We consider the arrangement fee to be fixed and determinable if it is not subject to adjustment and if the customer has not been granted extended payment terms. Excluding our long term contract arrangements for which revenue is recorded on a percentage of completion basis, extended payment terms are deemed to be present when any portion of the software license fee is due in excess of 90 days after the date of product delivery. In arrangements that contain extended payment terms, software revenue is recorded as customer payments become contractually due, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We consider the arrangement fee to be probable of collection if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay contractual amounts as they become due.\nOur software arrangements often contain multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, professional services and post-contract customer support. For multiple element software arrangements which qualify for separate element treatment, revenue is recognized for each element when each of the four basic criteria is met which, excluding post-contract customer support, is typically upon delivery. Revenue for post-contract customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, which is generally one year. Revenue is allocated to each element, excluding the software license, based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). VSOE is limited to the price charged when the element is sold separately or, for an element not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority. We do not have VSOE for our software licenses since they are seldom sold separately. Accordingly, revenue is allocated\nto the software license using the residual value method. Under the residual value method, revenue equal to VSOE of each undelivered element is recognized upon delivery of that element. Any remaining arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license. This has the effect of allocating any sales discount inherent in the arrangement to the software license fee.\nCertain of our software arrangements require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. These arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment as described above, and instead must be accounted for under contract accounting. Under contract accounting, companies must select from two generally accepted methods of accounting: the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method. The completed contract method recognizes revenue and costs upon contract completion, and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time. The percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and costs on a contract over time, as the work progresses.\nWe use the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long-term contracts, as we believe that we can make reasonably reliable estimates of progress toward completion. Progress is measured based on labor hours, as measured at the end of each reporting period, as a percentage of total expected labor hours. Accordingly, the revenue we record in any reporting period for arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining labor hours that will be incurred in fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our estimates at the end of any reporting period could prove to be materially different from final project results, as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion. To mitigate this risk, we solicit the input of our project professional staff on a monthly basis, as well as at the end of each financial reporting period, for purposes of evaluating cumulative labor hours incurred and verifying the estimated remaining effort to completion; this ensures that our estimates are always based on the most current projections available.\nNon-Software Arrangements\nFor arrangements governed by general revenue recognition literature, such as with our SaaS offerings or equipment and supplies only sales, we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met. These criteria are similar to those governing software transactions: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For our SaaS offerings, revenue is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis over the period of performance.\nFor arrangements consisting of multiple elements, revenue is allocated to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price of each element is based on VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. The residual method of allocation in a non-software arrangement is not permitted and, instead, arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable based on the proportion of each deliverable's selling price to the total arrangement fee. We are typically unable to establish TPE, which is based on the selling price charged by unrelated third-party vendors for similar deliverables when they are sold separately, as we are generally unable to obtain sufficient information on actual vendor selling prices to substantiate TPE. The objective of ESP is to estimate the price at which we would transact if the deliverable were sold separately rather than as part of a multiple element arrangement. Our determination of ESP considers several factors, including actual selling prices for similar transactions, gross margin expectations and our ongoing pricing strategy. We formally analyze our ESP determinations on at least an annual basis.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and tested periodically for impairment. We performed our annual impairment test of the carrying value of our goodwill for fiscal year 2017\nduring our fourth quarter, which is consistent with the historic timing of our annual goodwill impairment review. Our analysis of goodwill impairment was performed at the reporting unit level, which requires an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nWe had identified our Intellinx reporting unit as being at heightened risk of impairment during fiscal year 2016. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, based on continued shortfalls of revenue against our revenue projections, we performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the Intellinx reporting unit and determined the fair value was lower than its respective carrying value. Accordingly, we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which compared the estimated fair value of the Intellinx reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. As a result of this test, we recorded a non-cash, pretax, goodwill impairment charge of $7.5 million. Please refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nBased on the results of our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we concluded there was no additional goodwill impairment in our Intellinx reporting unit and no goodwill impairment in any of our other reporting units. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of our future impairment reviews. Further, we continue to assess the Intellinx reporting unit as being at a heightened risk of impairment. To the extent that future impairment charges occur, it would have a material impact on our financial results. At June 30, 2017, the carrying value of goodwill for all of our reporting units was approximately $194.7 million, and the carrying value of goodwill in our Intellinx reporting unit was $4.4 million.\nIn addition to our annual goodwill impairment review, we also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value and amortization periods of our other acquired intangible assets. These acquired intangible assets consist primarily of acquired customer related assets and acquired core technology. In evaluating potential impairment of these assets we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present, including:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>whether there has been a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>whether there has been a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf indicators of impairment are present, an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered. These estimates involve significant subjectivity. At June 30, 2017, the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, was approximately $142.2 million. As a result of our fiscal year 2017 impairment review, we concluded that none of these assets were impaired.\nValuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and Acquired Deferred Revenue\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have recorded acquired intangible assets relating principally to customer related assets, acquired technology and acquired contractual rights that include favorable economic terms as compared to overall market rates at the date of acquisition. The valuation process used to calculate the values assigned to these acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimation relative to our financial projections. The principal component of the valuation process is the determination of discounted future cash flows, and there are a number of variables that we consider for purposes of projecting these future cash flows. There is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process and, while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions, the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time. Further, the projections required for the valuation process generally utilize at least a ten-year forecast, which exceeds our normal internal planning and forecasting timeline. The particularly sensitive components of these estimates include, but are not limited to:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the selection of an appropriate discount rate; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our gross margin estimates (which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our technology and product life cycles; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the attrition rate of our customers, particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams, such as software maintenance; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the determination of third party market rates for leases or other contractual rights we acquire, for purposes of assessing whether we have acquired a favorable, unfavorable or at-market contract; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our planned level of operating expenses; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our effective tax rate. </td> </tr>\n</table> Additionally, we are required to estimate the acquisition date fair value of acquired deferred revenue that we assume as part of any acquisition. The acquisition date fair value of deferred revenue is estimated based on the costs we expect to incur in fulfilling the obligations, plus a normal profit margin. These cost estimates exclude amounts relating to any selling effort, since those costs would have been incurred by the predecessor company rather than by us. In the case of acquired software maintenance contracts, the cost estimates also exclude any ongoing research and development expenses associated with product upgrades since these amounts typically do not represent a legal obligation that we assume at the time of acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States (including its states and municipalities) as well as the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impact of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial statement purposes. The income tax expense we record in any interim period is based on our estimated tax rate for the full fiscal year, which requires us to estimate our annual pretax income and tax expense by jurisdiction. This process is inherently subjective and requires us to make estimates relative to our business plans, tax planning opportunities and operating results. An interim tax rate is subject to adjustment if, in later periods, there are changes to our estimate of total tax expense or pretax income, including income by jurisdiction. We update these estimates on a quarterly basis, so that our interim financial statements reflect our most current projections for the full fiscal year.\nOur income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current tax expense represents our estimate of taxes to be paid for the current period, including income tax expense arising from uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between when certain transactions are reflected in our financial statements and when those same items are included in a tax return. Deferred tax assets generally reflect the impact of a tax deduction, tax credit or operating loss carryforward that we have available for use in future year tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities generally reflect the impact of a deduction or expenditure that we have already taken in a tax return but that we have not yet reflected in our financial statements.\nWe record a deferred tax asset if we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a future tax benefit. Ultimate realization of any deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction before the expiration of carryforward periods, if any. Our assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability considers many different factors including historical and projected operating results, the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities that provide a source of future taxable income, the impact of current tax planning strategies and the availability of future tax planning strategies. We establish a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset for which we are unable to conclude that recoverability is more likely than not. This is inherently judgmental, since we are required to assess many different factors and evaluate as much objective evidence as we can in reaching an overall conclusion. The particularly sensitive component of our evaluation is our projection of future operating results since this relies heavily on our estimates of future revenue and expense levels by tax jurisdiction.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit we would have otherwise recorded if a tax position is uncertain. In evaluating whether a tax position is uncertain, we base our assessment on existing tax legislation, case law and legal statute. We also presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions at the largest amount deemed more likely than not will be realized upon tax examination. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as necessary.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2016\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer.\nOur operating segments are organized principally by the type of product or service offered and by geography. Similar operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable segments: Cloud Solutions, Digital Banking, Payments and Transactional Documents and Other.\nThe following tables represent our

30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.1 million, due primarily to increased revenue of $11.3 million from our legal spend management solutions and $4.9 million from our settlement network solutions. Segment profit increased $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $0.4 million, due primarily to the revenue increase described above, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of $8.6 million and increased operating expenses of $2.9 million; the majority of which related to increased product development costs. We expect revenue and profit for the Cloud Solutions segment to increase in fiscal year 2018 as a result of increased revenue from our legal spend management solutions and settlement network solutions.\nDigital Banking\nRevenues from our Digital Banking segment increased $8.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increases of $6.7 million in subscription and transaction revenue and $3.3 million in service and maintenance revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in software license revenue. Segment profit decreased $2.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increased product development costs of $3.4 million, partially offset by increased gross margins of $0.7 million and reduced sales and marketing costs of $0.7 million. We expect revenue for the Digital Banking segment to increase and profit for the Digital Banking segment to remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018, as a result of our continued investment in certain of our newer digital banking solutions.\nPayments and Transactional Documents\nRevenues from our Payments and Transactional Documents segment decreased $17.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $9.5 million. The overall revenue decrease was primarily attributable to revenue decreases of $12.0 million in service and maintenance revenue, $6.9 million in software license revenue and $1.9 million in other revenue, partially offset by increases of $3.7 million in subscriptions and transactions\nrevenue. The segment profit decrease of $4.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the prior fiscal year, included an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.8 million, and was primarily attributable to the revenue decrease described above, partially offset by decreased cost of revenues of $5.7 million and decreased sales and marketing expenses of $5.3 million. We expect revenue and profit for the Payments and Transactional Documents segment to increase in fiscal year 2018 as a result of increased sales of our payment and document automation solutions.\nOther\nRevenues from our Other segment decreased $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to decreases in subscriptions and transactions and software license revenue. Segment profit decreased $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to the reduction in revenue. We expect Other segment revenue to increase and profit to increase slightly in fiscal year 2018 principally as the result of sales of our cyber fraud and risk management products.\nRevenues by Category\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\nInc (Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscriptions and transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 222,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 195,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 27,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,141 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(43.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,659 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,872 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Subscriptions and Transactions\nRevenues from subscriptions and transactions increased $27.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $7.5 million. The overall revenue increase was due principally to increases in revenue from our Cloud Solutions segment and Digital Banking segment of $18.3 million and $6.7 million, respectively. We expect subscriptions and transactions revenues to increase in fiscal year 2018 primarily as a result of the revenue contribution from our legal spend management solutions, our settlement network solutions and revenue increases in our Digital Banking segment.\nSoftware Licenses\nRevenues from software licenses decreased $9.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.0 million. The overall revenue decrease was primarily as a result of decreases in revenue from our European payments and transactional documents solutions of $5.1 million, our North American payments and transactional documents solutions of $1.9 million and our Digital Banking segment of $1.5 million. We expect software license revenues to increase slightly in fiscal year 2018.\nService and Maintenance\nRevenues from service and maintenance decreased $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.9 million. The overall decrease was primarily the result of decreases in revenue from our European payments and transactional documents solutions of $10.1 million. We expect that service and maintenance revenues will decrease slightly in fiscal year 2018.\nOther\nOur other revenues in fiscal year 2017 consisted principally of equipment and supplies sales which remained minor components of our overall revenue. We expect that other revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nCost of Revenues\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\nInc (Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscriptions and transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.2 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(212 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (20.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.5 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,322 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (26.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 147,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 14,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 187,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,588 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Subscriptions and Transactions\nSubscriptions and transactions costs include salaries and other related costs for our professional services teams as well as costs related to our hosting infrastructure such as depreciation and facilities related expenses. Subscriptions and transactions costs as a percentage of subscriptions and transactions revenues increased slightly to 47% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 45% for the prior fiscal year. We expect that subscriptions and transactions costs as a percentage of subscriptions and transactions revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware license costs consist of expenses incurred by us to manufacture, package and distribute our software products and related documentation and costs of licensing third party software that is incorporated into or sold with certain of our products. Software license costs as a percentage of software license revenues increased slightly to 7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 5% for the prior fiscal year, due primarily to a reduction in revenues from our European payments and transactional documents solutions and relatively unchanged cost of revenues. We expect that software license costs as a percentage of software license revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nService and Maintenance\nService and maintenance costs include salaries and other related costs for our customer service, maintenance and help desk support staffs, as well as third party contractor expenses used to complement our professional services team. Service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues increased to 49% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 44% for the prior fiscal year, due primarily to the decrease in service and maintenance revenue in our European and North American payments and transactional documents solutions, and relatively unchanged cost of revenues. We expect that service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues will decrease in fiscal year 2018.\nOther\nOther costs include the costs associated with equipment and supplies that we resell, as well as freight, shipping and postage costs associated with the delivery of our products and remain minor components of our business. We expect that other costs as a percentage of other revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,598 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.8)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product development and engineering\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,732 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.3)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 208,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 199,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade show participation. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $6.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.9 million, due primarily to a decrease in employee related costs of $4.0 million, advertising expenses of $1.0 million and travel expenses of $0.6 million. We expect sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2018.\nProduct Development and Engineering\nProduct development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development, which consists of enhancements and revisions to our products based on customer feedback and general marketplace demands. Product development and engineering expenses increased by $5.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of an increase in headcount related costs. We expect product development and engineering expenses will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses increased by $7.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.4 million, due primarily to an increase in costs associated with our global internal system implementations of $4.6 million and acquisition related costs of $1.4 million. We expect general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue during fiscal year 2018, primarily as a result of decreased global internal system implementation costs.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nWe amortize our acquired intangible assets in proportion to the estimated rate at which the asset provides economic benefit to us. Accordingly, amortization expense rates are often higher in the earlier periods of an asset's estimated life. The decrease in amortization expense of $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year occurred as a result of amortization rates decreasing over the underlying asset lives. We expect that total amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for fiscal year 2018 will be approximately $20.6 million.\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we recorded a $7.5 million goodwill impairment charge as a result of an impairment test conducted for our Intellinx reporting unit. Please refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(82 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.4)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,059 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,539 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,520 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(478 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(306 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(172 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56.2)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (17,086 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (15,312 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,774 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.6)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Other Income (Expense), Net\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, interest income decreased slightly. Interest expense increased due to increased amortization of the debt discount related to our 1.50% convertible senior notes. Other expense in fiscal year 2017 was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses. We expect that interest income and other expense, net will remain relatively minor components of our overall operations during fiscal year 2018. We expect interest expense to increase slightly due to the continued amortization of debt discount costs and interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility, which we intend to draw on as a source of funding to facilitate repayment of the principal balance of the Notes in December 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $5.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to income tax expense of $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The tax benefit in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit in Switzerland of $4.5 million related to the impairment of its investment in Intellinx Ltd. We also recorded a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations and a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased United Kingdom (UK) income tax rates. The income tax benefit was offset in part by tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was principally due to tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, which was offset in part by a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations. Our tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was offset in part by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased UK income tax rates. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes.\nFiscal

compared to the prior fiscal year was due to increased legal spend management and settlement network solutions revenue. The increased revenue includes the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates of approximately $2.9 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. The segment profit increase of $8.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $0.7 million, arose from improved gross margins of $7.9 million as a result of the increased revenue and improved subscriptions and transactions gross margins from our settlement network solutions.\nDigital Banking\nThe revenue decrease in our Digital Banking segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease of $10.2 million in professional services revenue as a result of the continued de-emphasis of large, highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions, partially offset by an increase in subscription and transaction revenue of $3.2 million. The segment profit decrease of $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the decreased revenue and increased operating expenses of $1.1 million, mainly arising from an increase in sales and marketing expenses.\nPayments and Transactional Documents\nThe slight revenue decrease for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year includes the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates of approximately $4.8 million primarily associated with the British Pound Sterling, which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar when compared to the prior fiscal year. The decreased revenue, inclusive of the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates, was primarily attributable to decreases in services and maintenance revenues of $2.9 million, software license revenue of $2.8 million, and other revenue of $0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in subscription and transaction revenue of $4.6 million. The revenue decreases were primarily attributable to decreased North American software license and service and maintenance revenue. The segment profit decrease of $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, including an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.5 million, was primarily due to the decrease in revenue as discussed above.\nOther\nThe revenue increase in our Other segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due the full year impact of the January 2015 Intellinx acquisition. The segment profit increase of $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily the result of the increased revenue described above.\nRevenues by Category\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\nInc (Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscriptions and transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 23,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,081 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,891 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(469 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.3)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 343,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 330,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Subscriptions and Transactions\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were unfavorably impacted by $2.6 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The overall increase in subscriptions and transactions revenues was due to an increase in the revenue contribution from our Cloud Solutions segment of $14.5 million, our Payments and Transactional Documents segment of $4.6 million, our Digital Banking segment of $3.2 million and our Other segment of $1.5 million. The Cloud Solutions segment revenue increases were driven primarily by our settlement network solutions and, to a lesser extent, from our legal spend management solutions.\nSoftware Licenses\nThe decrease in software license revenues was attributable to decreases in North American revenues within our Payments and Transactional Documents segment, offset in part by increased revenue in our cyber fraud and risk management solutions and certain European solutions. Software license revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was unfavorably impacted by $0.7 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily associated with the British Pound Sterling which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar when compared to the prior fiscal year.\nService and Maintenance\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were unfavorably impacted by $4.4 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The overall decrease in service and maintenance revenues was primarily the result of decreases in professional services revenue of $10.2 million in our Digital Banking segment as we continued to de-emphasize large and highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from our cyber fraud and risk management solutions primarily related to the full year impact of our January 2015 Intellinx acquisition.\nOther\nOther revenues decreased slightly in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nCost of Revenues\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscriptions and transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(553 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.9)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(308 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 196,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 191,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Subscriptions and Transactions\nSubscriptions and transactions costs decreased slightly to 45% of subscriptions and transactions revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 46% of subscriptions and transactions revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware license costs decreased to 5% of software license revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 7% of software license revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\nService and Maintenance\nService and maintenance costs increased to 44% of service and maintenance revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 41% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

Interest expense increased slightly due to increased amortization of our debt discount. Other expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to income tax expense of $18.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was principally due to tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, which was offset in part by a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations. Our tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was offset in part by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased UK income tax rates. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax expense in fiscal year 2015 was predominantly due to $16.0 million of tax expense arising from a reserve we established against a portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets. To a lesser extent in fiscal year 2015, we also recorded tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, offset in part by an income tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities, the sale of our common stock and the issuance of the Notes in December 2012. We have historically generated positive operating cash flows. Accordingly, we believe that the cash generated from our operations and the cash and cash equivalents we have on hand will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to our operating cash requirements, we will require cash to pay interest on the Notes and to make principal payments on the Notes at maturity or upon conversion. We are permitted to settle any conversion obligation under the Notes in excess of the principal balance in either cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. We intend to satisfy any conversion premium by issuing shares of our common stock. We believe that the cash generated from our operations and the cash and cash equivalents we have on hand, together with available funds under the credit agreement we entered in December 2016, will be sufficient to meet our future cash obligations. If our existing cash resources along with cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our funding requirements we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek other financing arrangements.\nOn December 9, 2016, we (as borrower) and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (as guarantors) entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, that provides for a five-year revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $300 million (the Credit Facility). We intend to finance the repayment of the principal balance of the Notes through a combination of cash on hand and with borrowings under the Credit Facility. Please refer to Note 10 Indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nAs of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants associated with the Credit Facility.\nOne of our financial goals is to maintain and improve our capital structure. The key metrics we focus on in assessing the strength of our liquidity and a summary of our cash activity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the tables below:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 124,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,174 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>The Notes are shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their carrying value, which represents the principal balance of $189.8 million less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 60,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 67,157 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,759 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,992 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,170 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,217 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table> Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. At June 30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents of $124.6 million consisted primarily of cash deposits held at major banks and money market funds. The $27.4 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from June 30, 2016 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $61.0 million and proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities of $47.0 million, partially offset by $28.2 million used for capital expenditures, including capitalization of software costs, cash used for purchases of available-for-sale securities of $14.1 million and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $39.9 million.\nAt June 30, 2017, our marketable securities of $2.0 million consisted primarily of U.S. corporate debt securities.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included approximately $59.3 million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017. Our current intention is to reinvest these amounts in the growth of our foreign operations. If our reinvestment plans change based on future events and we decide to repatriate these amounts to fund our domestic operations, the amounts would generally become subject to tax in the U.S. to the extent there were cumulative profits in the foreign subsidiary from which the distribution to the U.S. was made.\nCash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the British Pound, Euro and Swiss Franc to the U.S. Dollar increased our overall cash balances by approximately $0.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Further changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of these currencies could have a significant effect on our overall cash balances. However, we continue to believe that our existing cash balances, even in light of the foreign currency volatility we frequently experience, are adequate to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nOperating Activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income or loss for non-cash operating items, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, deferred income tax benefits or expenses, and impairment charges; and changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. Cash generated from operations decreased by $6.2 million for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year. In addition to the increase in our net loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year of $13.5 million, the decrease in cash generated from operations was primarily related to a decrease in cash flows from deferred revenue of $8.0 million, partially offset by an increase in cash flows from other assets of $5.3 million, accrued expenses of $2.8 million and non-cash adjustments to our net loss of $6.0 million.\nAt June 30, 2017, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $104.8 million which expire at various times through fiscal year 2037, Swiss net operating loss carryforwards of $25.8 million which expire in fiscal year 2024, Canadian net operating loss carryforwards of $0.3 million which expire principally in fiscal year 2035, and other foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $22.1 million, primarily in Europe and Israel, which have no statutory expiration date. We also have approximately $6.0 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards available which expire at various points through fiscal year 2037. Our operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt June 30, 2017, a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets have been reserved since, given the available evidence, it was deemed more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized.\nInvesting Activities. Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized software costs, investment purchases and sales and cash used for acquisition of businesses and assets. The $50.5 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities of $31.2 million, a reduction in purchases of available-for-sale securities of $14.1 million and a reduction in purchases of cost-method investments of $4.0 million.\nFinancing Activities. Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. The $1.2 million decrease in cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock of $4.0 million, partially offset by debt issuance costs of $2.2 million related to our Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nFollowing is a summary of future payments that we are required to make under existing contractual obligations as of June 30, 2017:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019-2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021-2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payment (due December 2017)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 189,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility commitment fee (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,331 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,247 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,968 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 15,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 7,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 234,719 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>The Credit Facility agreement includes a commitment fee, which we have included in the table above, based on the applicable interest rate as of June 30, 2017 and our unborrowed capacity of $300 million. </td> </tr>\n</table> Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the\ntransaction. Obligations under contract that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nOur estimate of unrecognized tax benefits for which cash settlement may be required, in the amount of $1.4 million, has been excluded from the table above. These amounts have been excluded because, as of June 30, 2017, we are unable to estimate the timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with these liabilities as we do not currently anticipate settling any of these tax positions with cash payment in the foreseeable future.\nThe contractual obligations table above also excludes our estimate of the contributions we will make to our Swiss defined benefit pension plan in fiscal year 2018, which is $1.6 million based on foreign exchange rates in effect on June 30, 2017. We have not disclosed contributions for periods after fiscal year 2018, as those amounts are subject to future changes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data and the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Annual Report that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Without limiting the foregoing, the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, intends, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us up to and including the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. You should carefully review those factors and also carefully review the risks outlined in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn the management discussion that follows we have highlighted those changes and operating factors that were the primary factors affecting period to period fluctuations. The remainder of the change in period to period fluctuations from that which is specifically discussed arises from various individually insignificant items.\nOverview\nWe help businesses pay and get paid. We make complex business payments simple, smart and secure by providing a trusted and easy-to-use set of cloud-based business payment, digital banking, fraud prevention, payment and financial document solutions. We offer cloud solutions, as well as software designed to run on-site at the customer's location. The majority of our revenues are derived from offerings sold as SaaS-based solutions and paid for on a subscription and transaction basis.\nWe operate cloud-based settlement networks that facilitate electronic payments and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. We offer cloud and on-premise solutions that banks use to provide payment, cash management and treasury capabilities to their business customers, as well as solutions that banks and credit unions use to facilitate customer acquisition and growth. We offer legal spend management solutions that help manage and determine the right amount to pay for legal services and claims vendor expenditures for insurance companies and other large corporate consumers of outside legal services. Our corporate customers rely on our solutions to automate their payment and accounts payable processes and to streamline and manage the production and retention of electronic documents. Our healthcare customers use our solutions to streamline financial processes, particularly the patient enrollment process. We also offer comprehensive cyber fraud and risk management solutions that are designed to non-invasively monitor and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag behavioral and data anomalies and other suspicious activity.\nOur solutions are designed to complement, leverage and extend our customers' existing information systems, accounting applications and banking relationships so that they can be deployed quickly and efficiently. To help our customers realize the maximum value from our products and meet their specific business requirements, we also provide professional services for installation, training, consulting and product enhancement.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor fiscal year 2017, our revenue increased to $349.4 million from $343.3 million in the prior year. Our revenue for fiscal year 2017 was unfavorably impacted by $14.0 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound Sterling that depreciated against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior year. The revenue increase, inclusive of foreign exchange impacts, was attributable to revenue increases in our Cloud Solutions segment of $16.2 million and Digital Banking segment of $8.5 million,\noffset by decreased revenue in our Payments and Transactional Documents segment of $17.1 million and Other segment of $1.5 million. Increased revenue from our legal spend management and settlement network solutions accounted for the revenue increase in our Cloud Solutions segment. The Digital Banking segment's revenue increase was primarily due to increased subscription and transaction revenue from our cloud based solutions. The revenue decrease in our Payments and Transactional Documents segment was related to lower European and North American software license revenue and lower service and maintenance revenue in our payment and document automation products.\nWe incurred a net loss of $33.1 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to a net loss of $19.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Our net loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was affected by the impact of decreased gross margins of $8.6 million and increased operating expenses of $9.0 million. The decrease in gross margins was primarily driven by decreases in revenue in our Payments and Transactional Documents and Other segments. The increase in our operating expenses was due primarily to a goodwill impairment charge of $7.5 million that we recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and increased global enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation costs which did not qualify for capitalization of $4.6 million. Our operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were favorably impacted by $4.9 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound Sterling which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior year.\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we derived approximately 37% of our revenue from customers located outside of North America, principally in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWe expect future revenue growth to be driven by our digital banking, legal spend management and settlement network solutions.\nOver the past several years we have made strategic investments in innovative new technology offerings that we believe will enhance our competitive position, help us win new business, drive subscription revenue growth and expand our operating margins. We believe that these initiatives have positioned us effectively for revenue growth in future years.\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn December 9, 2016, we (as borrower) and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (as guarantors) entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders. Please refer to Note 10 Indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nRevenue Sources\nOur revenues are derived from multiple sources and are reported under the following classifications:\n \u2022 Subscriptions and Transactions Fees. We derive subscription and transaction fees from a number of sources, principally our SaaS offerings. Subscription revenues are typically recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. Transaction revenues are typically recorded at the time transactions are processed. Some of our SaaS products require customers to pay non-refundable set up or installation fees. In these cases, since the up-front fees do not represent a separate revenue earnings process, these fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is generally between five and ten years. A significant part of our focus remains on growing the revenue contribution from our SaaS offerings and subscriptions and transactions based revenue streams. \n \u2022 Software License Fees. Software license revenues, which we derive from our software applications, are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased. Fees from the sale of perpetual software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer, assuming that payment from the customer is probable and there are no extended payment terms. \n However, certain of our software arrangements, particularly those related to financial institution customers, are recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project because they require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. Recently however, the number of percentage of completion arrangements we enter into has declined as we have continued to de-emphasize large, highly customized projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions. \n \u2022 Service and Maintenance Fees. Our service and maintenance revenues consist of professional services fees and customer support and maintenance fees. Revenues relating to professional services not associated with highly customized software solutions are normally recognized at the time services are rendered. Professional services revenues associated with software license arrangements that include significant customization and modification are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project. Software maintenance fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the respective maintenance period, which is typically one year. \n \u2022 Other Revenues. We derive other revenues from the sale of printers, check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners. These revenues are normally recognized at the time of delivery.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates - which also would have been reasonable - could have been used. These critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, the valuation of acquired deferred revenue and income taxes. These critical policies and our procedures related to these policies are discussed below. In addition, refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nRevenue Recognition\nSoftware Arrangements\nWe recognize revenue on our software license arrangements when four basic criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable. We consider a fully executed agreement or a customer purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Delivery is deemed to have occurred upon transfer of the product to the customer or the completion of services rendered. We consider the arrangement fee to be fixed and determinable if it is not subject to adjustment and if the customer has not been granted extended payment terms. Excluding our long term contract arrangements for which revenue is recorded on a percentage of completion basis, extended payment terms are deemed to be present when any portion of the software license fee is due in excess of 90 days after the date of product delivery. In arrangements that contain extended payment terms, software revenue is recorded as customer payments become contractually due, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We consider the arrangement fee to be probable of collection if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay contractual amounts as they become due.\nOur software arrangements often contain multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, professional services and post-contract customer support. For multiple element software arrangements which qualify for separate element treatment, revenue is recognized for each element when each of the four basic criteria is met which, excluding post-contract customer support, is typically upon delivery. Revenue for post-contract customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, which is generally one year. Revenue is allocated to each element, excluding the software license, based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). VSOE is limited to the price charged when the element is sold separately or, for an element not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority. We do not have VSOE for our software licenses since they are seldom sold separately. Accordingly, revenue is allocated\nto the software license using the residual value method. Under the residual value method, revenue equal to VSOE of each undelivered element is recognized upon delivery of that element. Any remaining arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license. This has the effect of allocating any sales discount inherent in the arrangement to the software license fee.\nCertain of our software arrangements require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. These arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment as described above, and instead must be accounted for under contract accounting. Under contract accounting, companies must select from two generally accepted methods of accounting: the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method. The completed contract method recognizes revenue and costs upon contract completion, and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time. The percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and costs on a contract over time, as the work progresses.\nWe use the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long-term contracts, as we believe that we can make reasonably reliable estimates of progress toward completion. Progress is measured based on labor hours, as measured at the end of each reporting period, as a percentage of total expected labor hours. Accordingly, the revenue we record in any reporting period for arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining labor hours that will be incurred in fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our estimates at the end of any reporting period could prove to be materially different from final project results, as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion. To mitigate this risk, we solicit the input of our project professional staff on a monthly basis, as well as at the end of each financial reporting period, for purposes of evaluating cumulative labor hours incurred and verifying the estimated remaining effort to completion; this ensures that our estimates are always based on the most current projections available.\nNon-Software Arrangements\nFor arrangements governed by general revenue recognition literature, such as with our SaaS offerings or equipment and supplies only sales, we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met. These criteria are similar to those governing software transactions: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For our SaaS offerings, revenue is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis over the period of performance.\nFor arrangements consisting of multiple elements, revenue is allocated to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price of each element is based on VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. The residual method of allocation in a non-software arrangement is not permitted and, instead, arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable based on the proportion of each deliverable's selling price to the total arrangement fee. We are typically unable to establish TPE, which is based on the selling price charged by unrelated third-party vendors for similar deliverables when they are sold separately, as we are generally unable to obtain sufficient information on actual vendor selling prices to substantiate TPE. The objective of ESP is to estimate the price at which we would transact if the deliverable were sold separately rather than as part of a multiple element arrangement. Our determination of ESP considers several factors, including actual selling prices for similar transactions, gross margin expectations and our ongoing pricing strategy. We formally analyze our ESP determinations on at least an annual basis.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and tested periodically for impairment. We performed our annual impairment test of the carrying value of our goodwill for fiscal year 2017\nduring our fourth quarter, which is consistent with the historic timing of our annual goodwill impairment review. Our analysis of goodwill impairment was performed at the reporting unit level, which requires an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nWe had identified our Intellinx reporting unit as being at heightened risk of impairment during fiscal year 2016. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, based on continued shortfalls of revenue against our revenue projections, we performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the Intellinx reporting unit and determined the fair value was lower than its respective carrying value. Accordingly, we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which compared the estimated fair value of the Intellinx reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. As a result of this test, we recorded a non-cash, pretax, goodwill impairment charge of $7.5 million. Please refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nBased on the results of our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we concluded there was no additional goodwill impairment in our Intellinx reporting unit and no goodwill impairment in any of our other reporting units. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of our future impairment reviews. Further, we continue to assess the Intellinx reporting unit as being at a heightened risk of impairment. To the extent that future impairment charges occur, it would have a material impact on our financial results. At June 30, 2017, the carrying value of goodwill for all of our reporting units was approximately $194.7 million, and the carrying value of goodwill in our Intellinx reporting unit was $4.4 million.\nIn addition to our annual goodwill impairment review, we also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value and amortization periods of our other acquired intangible assets. These acquired intangible assets consist primarily of acquired customer related assets and acquired core technology. In evaluating potential impairment of these assets we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present, including:\n \u2022 whether there has been a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset; \n \u2022 whether there has been a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; and \n \u2022 whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life. \nIf indicators of impairment are present, an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered. These estimates involve significant subjectivity. At June 30, 2017, the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, was approximately $142.2 million. As a result of our fiscal year 2017 impairment review, we concluded that none of these assets were impaired.\nValuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and Acquired Deferred Revenue\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have recorded acquired intangible assets relating principally to customer related assets, acquired technology and acquired contractual rights that include favorable economic terms as compared to overall market rates at the date of acquisition. The valuation process used to calculate the values assigned to these acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimation relative to our financial projections. The principal component of the valuation process is the determination of discounted future cash flows, and there are a number of variables that we consider for purposes of projecting these future cash flows. There is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process and, while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions, the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time. Further, the projections required for the valuation process generally utilize at least a ten-year forecast, which exceeds our normal internal planning and forecasting timeline. The particularly sensitive components of these estimates include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 the selection of an appropriate discount rate; \n \u2022 the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams; \n \u2022 our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue; \n \u2022 our gross margin estimates (which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue); \n \u2022 our technology and product life cycles; \n \u2022 the attrition rate of our customers, particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams, such as software maintenance; \n \u2022 the determination of third party market rates for leases or other contractual rights we acquire, for purposes of assessing whether we have acquired a favorable, unfavorable or at-market contract; \n \u2022 our planned level of operating expenses; and \n \u2022 our effective tax rate.  Additionally, we are required to estimate the acquisition date fair value of acquired deferred revenue that we assume as part of any acquisition. The acquisition date fair value of deferred revenue is estimated based on the costs we expect to incur in fulfilling the obligations, plus a normal profit margin. These cost estimates exclude amounts relating to any selling effort, since those costs would have been incurred by the predecessor company rather than by us. In the case of acquired software maintenance contracts, the cost estimates also exclude any ongoing research and development expenses associated with product upgrades since these amounts typically do not represent a legal obligation that we assume at the time of acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States (including its states and municipalities) as well as the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impact of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial statement purposes. The income tax expense we record in any interim period is based on our estimated tax rate for the full fiscal year, which requires us to estimate our annual pretax income and tax expense by jurisdiction. This process is inherently subjective and requires us to make estimates relative to our business plans, tax planning opportunities and operating results. An interim tax rate is subject to adjustment if, in later periods, there are changes to our estimate of total tax expense or pretax income, including income by jurisdiction. We update these estimates on a quarterly basis, so that our interim financial statements reflect our most current projections for the full fiscal year.\nOur income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current tax expense represents our estimate of taxes to be paid for the current period, including income tax expense arising from uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between when certain transactions are reflected in our financial statements and when those same items are included in a tax return. Deferred tax assets generally reflect the impact of a tax deduction, tax credit or operating loss carryforward that we have available for use in future year tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities generally reflect the impact of a deduction or expenditure that we have already taken in a tax return but that we have not yet reflected in our financial statements.\nWe record a deferred tax asset if we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a future tax benefit. Ultimate realization of any deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction before the expiration of carryforward periods, if any. Our assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability considers many different factors including historical and projected operating results, the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities that provide a source of future taxable income, the impact of current tax planning strategies and the availability of future tax planning strategies. We establish a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset for which we are unable to conclude that recoverability is more likely than not. This is inherently judgmental, since we are required to assess many different factors and evaluate as much objective evidence as we can in reaching an overall conclusion. The particularly sensitive component of our evaluation is our projection of future operating results since this relies heavily on our estimates of future revenue and expense levels by tax jurisdiction.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit we would have otherwise recorded if a tax position is uncertain. In evaluating whether a tax position is uncertain, we base our assessment on existing tax legislation, case law and legal statute. We also presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions at the largest amount deemed more likely than not will be realized upon tax examination. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as necessary.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2016\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.1 million, due primarily to increased revenue of $11.3 million from our legal spend management solutions and $4.9 million from our settlement network solutions. Segment profit increased $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $0.4 million, due primarily to the revenue increase described above, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of $8.6 million and increased operating expenses of $2.9 million; the majority of which related to increased product development costs. We expect revenue and profit for the Cloud Solutions segment to increase in fiscal year 2018 as a result of increased revenue from our legal spend management solutions and settlement network solutions.\nDigital Banking\nRevenues from our Digital Banking segment increased $8.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increases of $6.7 million in subscription and transaction revenue and $3.3 million in service and maintenance revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in software license revenue. Segment profit decreased $2.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increased product development costs of $3.4 million, partially offset by increased gross margins of $0.7 million and reduced sales and marketing costs of $0.7 million. We expect revenue for the Digital Banking segment to increase and profit for the Digital Banking segment to remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018, as a result of our continued investment in certain of our newer digital banking solutions.\nPayments and Transactional Documents\nRevenues from our Payments and Transactional Documents segment decreased $17.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $9.5 million. The overall revenue decrease was primarily attributable to revenue decreases of $12.0 million in service and maintenance revenue, $6.9 million in software license revenue and $1.9 million in other revenue, partially offset by increases of $3.7 million in subscriptions and transactions\nrevenue. The segment profit decrease of $4.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the prior fiscal year, included an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.8 million, and was primarily attributable to the revenue decrease described above, partially offset by decreased cost of revenues of $5.7 million and decreased sales and marketing expenses of $5.3 million. We expect revenue and profit for the Payments and Transactional Documents segment to increase in fiscal year 2018 as a result of increased sales of our payment and document automation solutions.\nOther\nRevenues from our Other segment decreased $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to decreases in subscriptions and transactions and software license revenue. Segment profit decreased $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to the reduction in revenue. We expect Other segment revenue to increase and profit to increase slightly in fiscal year 2018 principally as the result of sales of our cyber fraud and risk management products.\nRevenues by Category\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\nInc (Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscriptions and transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 222,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 195,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 27,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,141 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(43.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,659 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,872 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Subscriptions and Transactions\nRevenues from subscriptions and transactions increased $27.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $7.5 million. The overall revenue increase was due principally to increases in revenue from our Cloud Solutions segment and Digital Banking segment of $18.3 million and $6.7 million, respectively. We expect subscriptions and transactions revenues to increase in fiscal year 2018 primarily as a result of the revenue contribution from our legal spend management solutions, our settlement network solutions and revenue increases in our Digital Banking segment.\nSoftware Licenses\nRevenues from software licenses decreased $9.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.0 million. The overall revenue decrease was primarily as a result of decreases in revenue from our European payments and transactional documents solutions of $5.1 million, our North American payments and transactional documents solutions of $1.9 million and our Digital Banking segment of $1.5 million. We expect software license revenues to increase slightly in fiscal year 2018.\nService and Maintenance\nRevenues from service and maintenance decreased $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.9 million. The overall decrease was primarily the result of decreases in revenue from our European payments and transactional documents solutions of $10.1 million. We expect that service and maintenance revenues will decrease slightly in fiscal year 2018.\nOther\nOur other revenues in fiscal year 2017 consisted principally of equipment and supplies sales which remained minor components of our overall revenue.

We expect that subscriptions and transactions costs as a percentage of subscriptions and transactions revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware license costs consist of expenses incurred by us to manufacture, package and distribute our software products and related documentation and costs of licensing third party software that is incorporated into or sold with certain of our products. Software license costs as a percentage of software license revenues increased slightly to 7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 5% for the prior fiscal year, due primarily to a reduction in revenues from our European payments and transactional documents solutions and relatively unchanged cost of revenues.

Service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues increased to 49% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 44% for the prior fiscal year, due primarily to the decrease in service and maintenance revenue in our European and North American payments and transactional documents solutions, and relatively unchanged cost of revenues. We expect that service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues will decrease in fiscal year 2018.\nOther\nOther costs include the costs associated with equipment and supplies that we resell, as well as freight, shipping and postage costs associated with the delivery of our products and remain minor components of our business. We expect that other costs as a percentage of other revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,598 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.8)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product development and engineering\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,732 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.3)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 208,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 199,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade show participation. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $6.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.9 million, due primarily to a decrease in employee related costs of $4.0 million, advertising expenses of $1.0 million and travel expenses of $0.6 million. We expect sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2018.\nProduct Development and Engineering\nProduct development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development, which consists of enhancements and revisions to our products based on customer feedback and general marketplace demands. Product development and engineering expenses increased by $5.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of an increase in headcount related costs. We expect product development and engineering expenses will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses increased by $7.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.4 million, due primarily to an increase in costs associated with our global internal system implementations of $4.6 million and acquisition related costs of $1.4 million. We expect general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue during fiscal year 2018, primarily as a result of decreased global internal system implementation costs.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nWe amortize our acquired intangible assets in proportion to the estimated rate at which the asset provides economic benefit to us. Accordingly, amortization expense rates are often higher in the earlier periods of an asset's estimated life. The decrease in amortization expense of $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year occurred as a result of amortization rates decreasing over the underlying asset lives. We expect that total amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for fiscal year 2018 will be approximately $20.6 million.\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we recorded a $7.5 million goodwill impairment charge as a result of an impairment test conducted for our Intellinx reporting unit. Please refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(82 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.4)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,059 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,539 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,520 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(478 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(306 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(172 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56.2)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (17,086 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (15,312 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,774 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.6)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Other Income (Expense), Net\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, interest income decreased slightly. Interest expense increased due to increased amortization of the debt discount related to our 1.50% convertible senior notes. Other expense in fiscal year 2017 was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses. We expect that interest income and other expense, net will remain relatively minor components of our overall operations during fiscal year 2018. We expect interest expense to increase slightly due to the continued amortization of debt discount costs and interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility, which we intend to draw on as a source of funding to facilitate repayment of the principal balance of the Notes in December 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $5.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to income tax expense of $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The tax benefit in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit in Switzerland of $4.5 million related to the impairment of its investment in Intellinx Ltd. We also recorded a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations and a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased United Kingdom (UK) income tax rates. The income tax benefit was offset in part by tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was principally due to tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, which was offset in part by a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations. Our tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was offset in part by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased UK income tax rates. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes.\nFiscal

compared to the prior fiscal year was due to increased legal spend management and settlement network solutions revenue. The increased revenue includes the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates of approximately $2.9 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. The segment profit increase of $8.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $0.7 million, arose from improved gross margins of $7.9 million as a result of the increased revenue and improved subscriptions and transactions gross margins from our settlement network solutions.\nDigital Banking\nThe revenue decrease in our Digital Banking segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease of $10.2 million in professional services revenue as a result of the continued de-emphasis of large, highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions, partially offset by an increase in subscription and transaction revenue of $3.2 million. The segment profit decrease of $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the decreased revenue and increased operating expenses of $1.1 million, mainly arising from an increase in sales and marketing expenses.\nPayments and Transactional Documents\nThe slight revenue decrease for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year includes the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates of approximately $4.8 million primarily associated with the British Pound Sterling, which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar when compared to the prior fiscal year. The decreased revenue, inclusive of the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates, was primarily attributable to decreases in services and maintenance revenues of $2.9 million, software license revenue of $2.8 million, and other revenue of $0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in subscription and transaction revenue of $4.6 million. The revenue decreases were primarily attributable to decreased North American software license and service and maintenance revenue. The segment profit decrease of $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, including an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.5 million, was primarily due to the decrease in revenue as discussed above.\nOther\nThe revenue increase in our Other segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due the full year impact of the January 2015 Intellinx acquisition. The segment profit increase of $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily the result of the increased revenue described above.\nRevenues by Category\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\nInc (Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscriptions and transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 23,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,081 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,891 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(469 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.3)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 343,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 330,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Subscriptions and Transactions\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were unfavorably impacted by $2.6 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The overall increase in subscriptions and transactions revenues was due to an increase in the revenue contribution from our Cloud Solutions segment of $14.5 million, our Payments and Transactional Documents segment of $4.6 million, our Digital Banking segment of $3.2 million and our Other segment of $1.5 million. The Cloud Solutions segment revenue increases were driven primarily by our settlement network solutions and, to a lesser extent, from our legal spend management solutions.\nSoftware Licenses\nThe decrease in software license revenues was attributable to decreases in North American revenues within our Payments and Transactional Documents segment, offset in part by increased revenue in our cyber fraud and risk management solutions and certain European solutions. Software license revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was unfavorably impacted by $0.7 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily associated with the British Pound Sterling which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar when compared to the prior fiscal year.\nService and Maintenance\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were unfavorably impacted by $4.4 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The overall decrease in service and maintenance revenues was primarily the result of decreases in professional services revenue of $10.2 million in our Digital Banking segment as we continued to de-emphasize large and highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from our cyber fraud and risk management solutions primarily related to the full year impact of our January 2015 Intellinx acquisition.\nOther\nOther revenues decreased slightly in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nCost of Revenues\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscriptions and transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(553 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.9)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(308 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 196,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 191,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Subscriptions and Transactions\nSubscriptions and transactions costs decreased slightly to 45% of subscriptions and transactions revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 46% of subscriptions and transactions revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware license costs decreased to 5% of software license revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 7% of software license revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\nService and Maintenance\nService and maintenance costs increased to 44% of service and maintenance revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 41% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in costs as a percent of service and maintenance revenues was driven by a decrease in professional services revenues and gross margins in our Digital Banking segment as we continued to de-emphasize large, highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard deployments.\nOther\nOther costs remained consistent at 73% of other revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to 72% of other revenues for the prior fiscal year.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change Inc\n(Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\nInc (Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 3,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.9 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product development and engineering\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.4 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.0 %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,405 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 199,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 192,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $3.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 principally due to an increase in headcount related costs. This increase was generally due to the operating costs of our fiscal year 2015 acquisitions and the impact of resources we hired to sell and promote our newer products.\nProduct Development and Engineering\nThe increase in product development and engineering expenses of $0.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was primarily a result of an increase in employee and professional services related costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was principally attributable to an increase in costs associated with global internal system implementations and an increase in employee related costs, partially attributable to our recent acquisitions, offset in part by a decrease in acquisition and integration related expenses.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe decrease in amortization expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year occurred as a result of amortization rates decreasing over the underlying assets lives.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nBetween Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\nInc (Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,539 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,765 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(774 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.2)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(306 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,287 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.2 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (15,312 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> (15,553 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year, interest income increased slightly. Interest expense increased slightly due to increased amortization of our debt discount. Other expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to income tax expense of $18.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was principally due to tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, which was offset in part by a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations. Our tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was offset in part by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased UK income tax rates. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax expense in fiscal year 2015 was predominantly due to $16.0 million of tax expense arising from a reserve we established against a portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets. To a lesser extent in fiscal year 2015, we also recorded tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, offset in part by an income tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities, the sale of our common stock and the issuance of the Notes in December 2012. We have historically generated positive operating cash flows. Accordingly, we believe that the cash generated from our operations and the cash and cash equivalents we have on hand will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to our operating cash requirements, we will require cash to pay interest on the Notes and to make principal payments on the Notes at maturity or upon conversion. We are permitted to settle any conversion obligation under the Notes in excess of the principal balance in either cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. We intend to satisfy any conversion premium by issuing shares of our common stock. We believe that the cash generated from our operations and the cash and cash equivalents we have on hand, together with available funds under the credit agreement we entered in December 2016, will be sufficient to meet our future cash obligations. If our existing cash resources along with cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our funding requirements we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek other financing arrangements.\nOn December 9, 2016, we (as borrower) and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (as guarantors) entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, that provides for a five-year revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $300 million (the Credit Facility). We intend to finance the repayment of the principal balance of the Notes through a combination of cash on hand and with borrowings under the Credit Facility. Please refer to Note 10 Indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nAs of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants associated with the Credit Facility.\nOne of our financial goals is to maintain and improve our capital structure. The key metrics we focus on in assessing the strength of our liquidity and a summary of our cash activity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the tables below:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 124,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,174 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The Notes are shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their carrying value, which represents the principal balance of $189.8 million less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. \nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 60,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 67,157 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,759 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,992 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,170 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,217 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table> Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. At June 30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents of $124.6 million consisted primarily of cash deposits held at major banks and money market funds. The $27.4 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from June 30, 2016 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $61.0 million and proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities of $47.0 million, partially offset by $28.2 million used for capital expenditures, including capitalization of software costs, cash used for purchases of available-for-sale securities of $14.1 million and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $39.9 million.\nAt June 30, 2017, our marketable securities of $2.0 million consisted primarily of U.S. corporate debt securities.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included approximately $59.3 million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017. Our current intention is to reinvest these amounts in the growth of our foreign operations. If our reinvestment plans change based on future events and we decide to repatriate these amounts to fund our domestic operations, the amounts would generally become subject to tax in the U.S. to the extent there were cumulative profits in the foreign subsidiary from which the distribution to the U.S. was made.\nCash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the British Pound, Euro and Swiss Franc to the U.S. Dollar increased our overall cash balances by approximately $0.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Further changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of these currencies could have a significant effect on our overall cash balances. However, we continue to believe that our existing cash balances, even in light of the foreign currency volatility we frequently experience, are adequate to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nOperating Activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income or loss for non-cash operating items, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, deferred income tax benefits or expenses, and impairment charges; and changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. Cash generated from operations decreased by $6.2 million for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year. In addition to the increase in our net loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year of $13.5 million, the decrease in cash generated from operations was primarily related to a decrease in cash flows from deferred revenue of $8.0 million, partially offset by an increase in cash flows from other assets of $5.3 million, accrued expenses of $2.8 million and non-cash adjustments to our net loss of $6.0 million.\nAt June 30, 2017, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $104.8 million which expire at various times through fiscal year 2037, Swiss net operating loss carryforwards of $25.8 million which expire in fiscal year 2024, Canadian net operating loss carryforwards of $0.3 million which expire principally in fiscal year 2035, and other foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $22.1 million, primarily in Europe and Israel, which have no statutory expiration date. We also have approximately $6.0 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards available which expire at various points through fiscal year 2037. Our operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt June 30, 2017, a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets have been reserved since, given the available evidence, it was deemed more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized.\nInvesting Activities. Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized software costs, investment purchases and sales and cash used for acquisition of businesses and assets. The $50.5 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities of $31.2 million, a reduction in purchases of available-for-sale securities of $14.1 million and a reduction in purchases of cost-method investments of $4.0 million.\nFinancing Activities. Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. The $1.2 million decrease in cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock of $4.0 million, partially offset by debt issuance costs of $2.2 million related to our Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nFollowing is a summary of future payments that we are required to make under existing contractual obligations as of June 30, 2017:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019-2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021-2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payment (due December 2017)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 189,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility commitment fee (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,331 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,247 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,968 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 15,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 7,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 6,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 234,719 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The Credit Facility agreement includes a commitment fee, which we have included in the table above, based on the applicable interest rate as of June 30, 2017 and our unborrowed capacity of $300 million.  Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the\ntransaction. Obligations under contract that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nOur estimate of unrecognized tax benefits for which cash settlement may be required, in the amount of $1.4 million, has been excluded from the table above. These amounts have been excluded because, as of June 30, 2017, we are unable to estimate the timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with these liabilities as we do not currently anticipate settling any of these tax positions with cash payment in the foreseeable future.\nThe contractual obligations table above also excludes our estimate of the contributions we will make to our Swiss defined benefit pension plan in fiscal year 2018, which is $1.6 million based on foreign exchange rates in effect on June 30, 2017. We have not disclosed contributions for periods after fiscal year 2018, as those amounts are subject to future changes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.\n ", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data and the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Annual Report that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Without limiting the foregoing, the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, intends, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us up to and including the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. You should carefully review those factors and also carefully review the risks outlined in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn the management discussion that follows we have highlighted those changes and operating factors that were the primary factors affecting period to period fluctuations. The remainder of the change in period to period fluctuations from that which is specifically discussed arises from various individually insignificant items.\nOverview\nWe help businesses pay and get paid. We make complex business payments simple, smart and secure by providing a trusted and easy-to-use set of cloud-based business payment, digital banking, fraud prevention, payment and financial document solutions. We offer cloud solutions, as well as software designed to run on-site at the customer's location. The majority of our revenues are derived from offerings sold as SaaS-based solutions and paid for on a subscription and transaction basis.\nWe operate cloud-based settlement networks that facilitate electronic payments and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. We offer cloud and on-premise solutions that banks use to provide payment, cash management and treasury capabilities to their business customers, as well as solutions that banks and credit unions use to facilitate customer acquisition and growth. We offer legal spend management solutions that help manage and determine the right amount to pay for legal services and claims vendor expenditures for insurance companies and other large corporate consumers of outside legal services. Our corporate customers rely on our solutions to automate their payment and accounts payable processes and to streamline and manage the production and retention of electronic documents. Our healthcare customers use our solutions to streamline financial processes, particularly the patient enrollment process. We also offer comprehensive cyber fraud and risk management solutions that are designed to non-invasively monitor and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag behavioral and data anomalies and other suspicious activity.\nOur solutions are designed to complement, leverage and extend our customers' existing information systems, accounting applications and banking relationships so that they can be deployed quickly and efficiently. To help our customers realize the maximum value from our products and meet their specific business requirements, we also provide professional services for installation, training, consulting and product enhancement.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor fiscal year 2017, our revenue increased to $349.4 million from $343.3 million in the prior year. Our revenue for fiscal year 2017 was unfavorably impacted by $14.0 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound Sterling that depreciated against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior year. The revenue increase, inclusive of foreign exchange impacts, was attributable to revenue increases in our Cloud Solutions segment of $16.2 million and Digital Banking segment of $8.5 million,\noffset by decreased revenue in our Payments and Transactional Documents segment of $17.1 million and Other segment of $1.5 million. Increased revenue from our legal spend management and settlement network solutions accounted for the revenue increase in our Cloud Solutions segment. The Digital Banking segment's revenue increase was primarily due to increased subscription and transaction revenue from our cloud based solutions. The revenue decrease in our Payments and Transactional Documents segment was related to lower European and North American software license revenue and lower service and maintenance revenue in our payment and document automation products.\nWe incurred a net loss of $33.1 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to a net loss of $19.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Our net loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was affected by the impact of decreased gross margins of $8.6 million and increased operating expenses of $9.0 million. The decrease in gross margins was primarily driven by decreases in revenue in our Payments and Transactional Documents and Other segments. The increase in our operating expenses was due primarily to a goodwill impairment charge of $7.5 million that we recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and increased global enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation costs which did not qualify for capitalization of $4.6 million. Our operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were favorably impacted by $4.9 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound Sterling which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior year.\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we derived approximately 37% of our revenue from customers located outside of North America, principally in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWe expect future revenue growth to be driven by our digital banking, legal spend management and settlement network solutions.\nOver the past several years we have made strategic investments in innovative new technology offerings that we believe will enhance our competitive position, help us win new business, drive subscription revenue growth and expand our operating margins. We believe that these initiatives have positioned us effectively for revenue growth in future years.\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn December 9, 2016, we (as borrower) and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (as guarantors) entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders. Please refer to Note 10 Indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nRevenue Sources\nOur revenues are derived from multiple sources and are reported under the following classifications:\n \u2022 Subscriptions and Transactions Fees. We derive subscription and transaction fees from a number of sources, principally our SaaS offerings. Subscription revenues are typically recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. Transaction revenues are typically recorded at the time transactions are processed. Some of our SaaS products require customers to pay non-refundable set up or installation fees. In these cases, since the up-front fees do not represent a separate revenue earnings process, these fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is generally between five and ten years. A significant part of our focus remains on growing the revenue contribution from our SaaS offerings and subscriptions and transactions based revenue streams. \n \u2022 Software License Fees. Software license revenues, which we derive from our software applications, are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased. Fees from the sale of perpetual software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer, assuming that payment from the customer is probable and there are no extended payment terms. \n However, certain of our software arrangements, particularly those related to financial institution customers, are recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project because they require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. Recently however, the number of percentage of completion arrangements we enter into has declined as we have continued to de-emphasize large, highly customized projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions. \n \u2022 Service and Maintenance Fees. Our service and maintenance revenues consist of professional services fees and customer support and maintenance fees. Revenues relating to professional services not associated with highly customized software solutions are normally recognized at the time services are rendered. Professional services revenues associated with software license arrangements that include significant customization and modification are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project. Software maintenance fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the respective maintenance period, which is typically one year. \n \u2022 Other Revenues. We derive other revenues from the sale of printers, check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners. These revenues are normally recognized at the time of delivery.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates - which also would have been reasonable - could have been used. These critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, the valuation of acquired deferred revenue and income taxes. These critical policies and our procedures related to these policies are discussed below. In addition, refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nRevenue Recognition\nSoftware Arrangements\nWe recognize revenue on our software license arrangements when four basic criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable. We consider a fully executed agreement or a customer purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Delivery is deemed to have occurred upon transfer of the product to the customer or the completion of services rendered. We consider the arrangement fee to be fixed and determinable if it is not subject to adjustment and if the customer has not been granted extended payment terms. Excluding our long term contract arrangements for which revenue is recorded on a percentage of completion basis, extended payment terms are deemed to be present when any portion of the software license fee is due in excess of 90 days after the date of product delivery. In arrangements that contain extended payment terms, software revenue is recorded as customer payments become contractually due, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We consider the arrangement fee to be probable of collection if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay contractual amounts as they become due.\nOur software arrangements often contain multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, professional services and post-contract customer support. For multiple element software arrangements which qualify for separate element treatment, revenue is recognized for each element when each of the four basic criteria is met which, excluding post-contract customer support, is typically upon delivery. Revenue for post-contract customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, which is generally one year. Revenue is allocated to each element, excluding the software license, based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). VSOE is limited to the price charged when the element is sold separately or, for an element not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority. We do not have VSOE for our software licenses since they are seldom sold separately. Accordingly, revenue is allocated\nto the software license using the residual value method. Under the residual value method, revenue equal to VSOE of each undelivered element is recognized upon delivery of that element. Any remaining arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license. This has the effect of allocating any sales discount inherent in the arrangement to the software license fee.\nCertain of our software arrangements require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. These arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment as described above, and instead must be accounted for under contract accounting. Under contract accounting, companies must select from two generally accepted methods of accounting: the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method. The completed contract method recognizes revenue and costs upon contract completion, and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time. The percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and costs on a contract over time, as the work progresses.\nWe use the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long-term contracts, as we believe that we can make reasonably reliable estimates of progress toward completion. Progress is measured based on labor hours, as measured at the end of each reporting period, as a percentage of total expected labor hours. Accordingly, the revenue we record in any reporting period for arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining labor hours that will be incurred in fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our estimates at the end of any reporting period could prove to be materially different from final project results, as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion. To mitigate this risk, we solicit the input of our project professional staff on a monthly basis, as well as at the end of each financial reporting period, for purposes of evaluating cumulative labor hours incurred and verifying the estimated remaining effort to completion; this ensures that our estimates are always based on the most current projections available.\nNon-Software Arrangements\nFor arrangements governed by general revenue recognition literature, such as with our SaaS offerings or equipment and supplies only sales, we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met. These criteria are similar to those governing software transactions: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For our SaaS offerings, revenue is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis over the period of performance.\nFor arrangements consisting of multiple elements, revenue is allocated to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price of each element is based on VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. The residual method of allocation in a non-software arrangement is not permitted and, instead, arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable based on the proportion of each deliverable's selling price to the total arrangement fee. We are typically unable to establish TPE, which is based on the selling price charged by unrelated third-party vendors for similar deliverables when they are sold separately, as we are generally unable to obtain sufficient information on actual vendor selling prices to substantiate TPE. The objective of ESP is to estimate the price at which we would transact if the deliverable were sold separately rather than as part of a multiple element arrangement. Our determination of ESP considers several factors, including actual selling prices for similar transactions, gross margin expectations and our ongoing pricing strategy. We formally analyze our ESP determinations on at least an annual basis.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and tested periodically for impairment. We performed our annual impairment test of the carrying value of our goodwill for fiscal year 2017\nduring our fourth quarter, which is consistent with the historic timing of our annual goodwill impairment review. Our analysis of goodwill impairment was performed at the reporting unit level, which requires an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nWe had identified our Intellinx reporting unit as being at heightened risk of impairment during fiscal year 2016. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, based on continued shortfalls of revenue against our revenue projections, we performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the Intellinx reporting unit and determined the fair value was lower than its respective carrying value. Accordingly, we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which compared the estimated fair value of the Intellinx reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. As a result of this test, we recorded a non-cash, pretax, goodwill impairment charge of $7.5 million. Please refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nBased on the results of our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we concluded there was no additional goodwill impairment in our Intellinx reporting unit and no goodwill impairment in any of our other reporting units. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of our future impairment reviews. Further, we continue to assess the Intellinx reporting unit as being at a heightened risk of impairment. To the extent that future impairment charges occur, it would have a material impact on our financial results. At June 30, 2017, the carrying value of goodwill for all of our reporting units was approximately $194.7 million, and the carrying value of goodwill in our Intellinx reporting unit was $4.4 million.\nIn addition to our annual goodwill impairment review, we also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value and amortization periods of our other acquired intangible assets. These acquired intangible assets consist primarily of acquired customer related assets and acquired core technology. In evaluating potential impairment of these assets we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present, including:\n \u2022 whether there has been a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset; \n \u2022 whether there has been a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; and \n \u2022 whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life. \nIf indicators of impairment are present, an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered. These estimates involve significant subjectivity. At June 30, 2017, the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, was approximately $142.2 million. As a result of our fiscal year 2017 impairment review, we concluded that none of these assets were impaired.\nValuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and Acquired Deferred Revenue\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have recorded acquired intangible assets relating principally to customer related assets, acquired technology and acquired contractual rights that include favorable economic terms as compared to overall market rates at the date of acquisition. The valuation process used to calculate the values assigned to these acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimation relative to our financial projections. The principal component of the valuation process is the determination of discounted future cash flows, and there are a number of variables that we consider for purposes of projecting these future cash flows. There is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process and, while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions, the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time. Further, the projections required for the valuation process generally utilize at least a ten-year forecast, which exceeds our normal internal planning and forecasting timeline. The particularly sensitive components of these estimates include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 the selection of an appropriate discount rate; \n \u2022 the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams; \n \u2022 our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue; \n \u2022 our gross margin estimates (which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue); \n \u2022 our technology and product life cycles; \n \u2022 the attrition rate of our customers, particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams, such as software maintenance; \n \u2022 the determination of third party market rates for leases or other contractual rights we acquire, for purposes of assessing whether we have acquired a favorable, unfavorable or at-market contract; \n \u2022 our planned level of operating expenses; and \n \u2022 our effective tax rate.  Additionally, we are required to estimate the acquisition date fair value of acquired deferred revenue that we assume as part of any acquisition. The acquisition date fair value of deferred revenue is estimated based on the costs we expect to incur in fulfilling the obligations, plus a normal profit margin. These cost estimates exclude amounts relating to any selling effort, since those costs would have been incurred by the predecessor company rather than by us. In the case of acquired software maintenance contracts, the cost estimates also exclude any ongoing research and development expenses associated with product upgrades since these amounts typically do not represent a legal obligation that we assume at the time of acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States (including its states and municipalities) as well as the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impact of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial statement purposes. The income tax expense we record in any interim period is based on our estimated tax rate for the full fiscal year, which requires us to estimate our annual pretax income and tax expense by jurisdiction. This process is inherently subjective and requires us to make estimates relative to our business plans, tax planning opportunities and operating results. An interim tax rate is subject to adjustment if, in later periods, there are changes to our estimate of total tax expense or pretax income, including income by jurisdiction. We update these estimates on a quarterly basis, so that our interim financial statements reflect our most current projections for the full fiscal year.\nOur income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current tax expense represents our estimate of taxes to be paid for the current period, including income tax expense arising from uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between when certain transactions are reflected in our financial statements and when those same items are included in a tax return. Deferred tax assets generally reflect the impact of a tax deduction, tax credit or operating loss carryforward that we have available for use in future year tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities generally reflect the impact of a deduction or expenditure that we have already taken in a tax return but that we have not yet reflected in our financial statements.\nWe record a deferred tax asset if we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a future tax benefit. Ultimate realization of any deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction before the expiration of carryforward periods, if any. Our assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability considers many different factors including historical and projected operating results, the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities that provide a source of future taxable income, the impact of current tax planning strategies and the availability of future tax planning strategies. We establish a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset for which we are unable to conclude that recoverability is more likely than not. This is inherently judgmental, since we are required to assess many different factors and evaluate as much objective evidence as we can in reaching an overall conclusion. The particularly sensitive component of our evaluation is our projection of future operating results since this relies heavily on our estimates of future revenue and expense levels by tax jurisdiction.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit we would have otherwise recorded if a tax position is uncertain. In evaluating whether a tax position is uncertain, we base our assessment on existing tax legislation, case law and legal statute. We also presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions at the largest amount deemed more likely than not will be realized upon tax examination. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as necessary.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2016\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer.\nOur operating segments are organized principally by the type of product or service offered and by geography. Similar operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable segments: Cloud Solutions, Digital Banking, Payments and Transactional Documents and Other.\nThe following tables represent our segment revenues and our segment measure of profit (loss):\n\nA reconciliation of the measure of total segment profit to our GAAP loss before income taxes is as follows:\n Cloud Solutions\nRevenues from our Cloud Solutions segment increased $16.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.1 million, due primarily to increased revenue of $11.3 million from our legal spend management solutions and $4.9 million from our settlement network solutions. Segment profit increased $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $0.4 million, due primarily to the revenue increase described above, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of $8.6 million and increased operating expenses of $2.9 million; the majority of which related to increased product development costs. We expect revenue and profit for the Cloud Solutions segment to increase in fiscal year 2018 as a result of increased revenue from our legal spend management solutions and settlement network solutions.\nDigital Banking\nRevenues from our Digital Banking segment increased $8.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increases of $6.7 million in subscription and transaction revenue and $3.3 million in service and maintenance revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in software license revenue. Segment profit decreased $2.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increased product development costs of $3.4 million, partially offset by increased gross margins of $0.7 million and reduced sales and marketing costs of $0.7 million. We expect revenue for the Digital Banking segment to increase and profit for the Digital Banking segment to remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018, as a result of our continued investment in certain of our newer digital banking solutions.\nPayments and Transactional Documents\nRevenues from our Payments and Transactional Documents segment decreased $17.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $9.5 million. The overall revenue decrease was primarily attributable to revenue decreases of $12.0 million in service and maintenance revenue, $6.9 million in software license revenue and $1.9 million in other revenue, partially offset by increases of $3.7 million in subscriptions and transactions\nrevenue. The segment profit decrease of $4.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the prior fiscal year, included an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.8 million, and was primarily attributable to the revenue decrease described above, partially offset by decreased cost of revenues of $5.7 million and decreased sales and marketing expenses of $5.3 million. We expect revenue and profit for the Payments and Transactional Documents segment to increase in fiscal year 2018 as a result of increased sales of our payment and document automation solutions.\nOther\nRevenues from our Other segment decreased $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to decreases in subscriptions and transactions and software license revenue. Segment profit decreased $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to the reduction in revenue. We expect Other segment revenue to increase and profit to increase slightly in fiscal year 2018 principally as the result of sales of our cyber fraud and risk management products.\nRevenues by Category\n Subscriptions and Transactions\nRevenues from subscriptions and transactions increased $27.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $7.5 million. The overall revenue increase was due principally to increases in revenue from our Cloud Solutions segment and Digital Banking segment of $18.3 million and $6.7 million, respectively. We expect subscriptions and transactions revenues to increase in fiscal year 2018 primarily as a result of the revenue contribution from our legal spend management solutions, our settlement network solutions and revenue increases in our Digital Banking segment.\nSoftware Licenses\nRevenues from software licenses decreased $9.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.0 million. The overall revenue decrease was primarily as a result of decreases in revenue from our European payments and transactional documents solutions of $5.1 million, our North American payments and transactional documents solutions of $1.9 million and our Digital Banking segment of $1.5 million. We expect software license revenues to increase slightly in fiscal year 2018.\nService and Maintenance\nRevenues from service and maintenance decreased $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.9 million. The overall decrease was primarily the result of decreases in revenue from our European payments and transactional documents solutions of $10.1 million. We expect that service and maintenance revenues will decrease slightly in fiscal year 2018.\nOther\nOur other revenues in fiscal year 2017 consisted principally of equipment and supplies sales which remained minor components of our overall revenue. We expect that other revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nCost of Revenues\n Subscriptions and Transactions\nSubscriptions and transactions costs include salaries and other related costs for our professional services teams as well as costs related to our hosting infrastructure such as depreciation and facilities related expenses. Subscriptions and transactions costs as a percentage of subscriptions and transactions revenues increased slightly to 47% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 45% for the prior fiscal year. We expect that subscriptions and transactions costs as a percentage of subscriptions and transactions revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware license costs consist of expenses incurred by us to manufacture, package and distribute our software products and related documentation and costs of licensing third party software that is incorporated into or sold with certain of our products. Software license costs as a percentage of software license revenues increased slightly to 7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 5% for the prior fiscal year, due primarily to a reduction in revenues from our European payments and transactional documents solutions and relatively unchanged cost of revenues. We expect that software license costs as a percentage of software license revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nService and Maintenance\nService and maintenance costs include salaries and other related costs for our customer service, maintenance and help desk support staffs, as well as third party contractor expenses used to complement our professional services team. Service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues increased to 49% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 44% for the prior fiscal year, due primarily to the decrease in service and maintenance revenue in our European and North American payments and transactional documents solutions, and relatively unchanged cost of revenues. We expect that service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues will decrease in fiscal year 2018.\nOther\nOther costs include the costs associated with equipment and supplies that we resell, as well as freight, shipping and postage costs associated with the delivery of our products and remain minor components of our business. We expect that other costs as a percentage of other revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2018.\nOperating Expenses\n Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade show participation. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $6.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.9 million, due primarily to a decrease in employee related costs of $4.0 million, advertising expenses of $1.0 million and travel expenses of $0.6 million. We expect sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2018.\nProduct Development and Engineering\nProduct development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development, which consists of enhancements and revisions to our products based on customer feedback and general marketplace demands. Product development and engineering expenses increased by $5.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of an increase in headcount related costs. We expect product development and engineering expenses will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses increased by $7.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.4 million, due primarily to an increase in costs associated with our global internal system implementations of $4.6 million and acquisition related costs of $1.4 million. We expect general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue during fiscal year 2018, primarily as a result of decreased global internal system implementation costs.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nWe amortize our acquired intangible assets in proportion to the estimated rate at which the asset provides economic benefit to us. Accordingly, amortization expense rates are often higher in the earlier periods of an asset's estimated life. The decrease in amortization expense of $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year occurred as a result of amortization rates decreasing over the underlying asset lives. We expect that total amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for fiscal year 2018 will be approximately $20.6 million.\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we recorded a $7.5 million goodwill impairment charge as a result of an impairment test conducted for our Intellinx reporting unit. Please refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n Other Income (Expense), Net\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, interest income decreased slightly. Interest expense increased due to increased amortization of the debt discount related to our 1.50% convertible senior notes. Other expense in fiscal year 2017 was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses. We expect that interest income and other expense, net will remain relatively minor components of our overall operations during fiscal year 2018. We expect interest expense to increase slightly due to the continued amortization of debt discount costs and interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility, which we intend to draw on as a source of funding to facilitate repayment of the principal balance of the Notes in December 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $5.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to income tax expense of $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The tax benefit in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit in Switzerland of $4.5 million related to the impairment of its investment in Intellinx Ltd. We also recorded a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations and a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased United Kingdom (UK) income tax rates. The income tax benefit was offset in part by tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was principally due to tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, which was offset in part by a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations. Our tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was offset in part by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased UK income tax rates. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2015\nSegment Information\nThe following tables represent our segment revenues and our segment measure of profit (loss):\n A reconciliation of the measure of total segment profit to our GAAP loss before income taxes is as follows:\n Cloud Solutions\nThe revenue increase in our Cloud Solutions segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was due to increased legal spend management and settlement network solutions revenue. The increased revenue includes the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates of approximately $2.9 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. The segment profit increase of $8.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $0.7 million, arose from improved gross margins of $7.9 million as a result of the increased revenue and improved subscriptions and transactions gross margins from our settlement network solutions.\nDigital Banking\nThe revenue decrease in our Digital Banking segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease of $10.2 million in professional services revenue as a result of the continued de-emphasis of large, highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions, partially offset by an increase in subscription and transaction revenue of $3.2 million. The segment profit decrease of $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the decreased revenue and increased operating expenses of $1.1 million, mainly arising from an increase in sales and marketing expenses.\nPayments and Transactional Documents\nThe slight revenue decrease for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year includes the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates of approximately $4.8 million primarily associated with the British Pound Sterling, which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar when compared to the prior fiscal year. The decreased revenue, inclusive of the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates, was primarily attributable to decreases in services and maintenance revenues of $2.9 million, software license revenue of $2.8 million, and other revenue of $0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in subscription and transaction revenue of $4.6 million. The revenue decreases were primarily attributable to decreased North American software license and service and maintenance revenue. The segment profit decrease of $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, including an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.5 million, was primarily due to the decrease in revenue as discussed above.\nOther\nThe revenue increase in our Other segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due the full year impact of the January 2015 Intellinx acquisition. The segment profit increase of $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily the result of the increased revenue described above.\nRevenues by Category\n Subscriptions and Transactions\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were unfavorably impacted by $2.6 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The overall increase in subscriptions and transactions revenues was due to an increase in the revenue contribution from our Cloud Solutions segment of $14.5 million, our Payments and Transactional Documents segment of $4.6 million, our Digital Banking segment of $3.2 million and our Other segment of $1.5 million. The Cloud Solutions segment revenue increases were driven primarily by our settlement network solutions and, to a lesser extent, from our legal spend management solutions.\nSoftware Licenses\nThe decrease in software license revenues was attributable to decreases in North American revenues within our Payments and Transactional Documents segment, offset in part by increased revenue in our cyber fraud and risk management solutions and certain European solutions. Software license revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was unfavorably impacted by $0.7 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily associated with the British Pound Sterling which depreciated against the U.S. Dollar when compared to the prior fiscal year.\nService and Maintenance\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were unfavorably impacted by $4.4 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The overall decrease in service and maintenance revenues was primarily the result of decreases in professional services revenue of $10.2 million in our Digital Banking segment as we continued to de-emphasize large and highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from our cyber fraud and risk management solutions primarily related to the full year impact of our January 2015 Intellinx acquisition.\nOther\nOther revenues decreased slightly in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nCost of Revenues\n Subscriptions and Transactions\nSubscriptions and transactions costs decreased slightly to 45% of subscriptions and transactions revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 46% of subscriptions and transactions revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware license costs decreased to 5% of software license revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 7% of software license revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\nService and Maintenance\nService and maintenance costs increased to 44% of service and maintenance revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 41% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in costs as a percent of service and maintenance revenues was driven by a decrease in professional services revenues and gross margins in our Digital Banking segment as we continued to de-emphasize large, highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard deployments.\nOther\nOther costs remained consistent at 73% of other revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to 72% of other revenues for the prior fiscal year.\nOperating Expenses\n Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $3.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 principally due to an increase in headcount related costs. This increase was generally due to the operating costs of our fiscal year 2015 acquisitions and the impact of resources we hired to sell and promote our newer products.\nProduct Development and Engineering\nThe increase in product development and engineering expenses of $0.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was primarily a result of an increase in employee and professional services related costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was principally attributable to an increase in costs associated with global internal system implementations and an increase in employee related costs, partially attributable to our recent acquisitions, offset in part by a decrease in acquisition and integration related expenses.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe decrease in amortization expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year occurred as a result of amortization rates decreasing over the underlying assets lives.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year, interest income increased slightly. Interest expense increased slightly due to increased amortization of our debt discount. Other expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to income tax expense of $18.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was principally due to tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, which was offset in part by a tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations. Our tax expense in fiscal year 2016 was offset in part by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased UK income tax rates. The U.S. income tax expense was principally due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes but not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax expense in fiscal year 2015 was predominantly due to $16.0 million of tax expense arising from a reserve we established against a portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets. To a lesser extent in fiscal year 2015, we also recorded tax expense associated with our U.S. and UK operations, offset in part by an income tax benefit associated with our Swiss and Israeli operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities, the sale of our common stock and the issuance of the Notes in December 2012. We have historically generated positive operating cash flows. Accordingly, we believe that the cash generated from our operations and the cash and cash equivalents we have on hand will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to our operating cash requirements, we will require cash to pay interest on the Notes and to make principal payments on the Notes at maturity or upon conversion. We are permitted to settle any conversion obligation under the Notes in excess of the principal balance in either cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. We intend to satisfy any conversion premium by issuing shares of our common stock. We believe that the cash generated from our operations and the cash and cash equivalents we have on hand, together with available funds under the credit agreement we entered in December 2016, will be sufficient to meet our future cash obligations. If our existing cash resources along with cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our funding requirements we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek other financing arrangements.\nOn December 9, 2016, we (as borrower) and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (as guarantors) entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, that provides for a five-year revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $300 million (the Credit Facility). We intend to finance the repayment of the principal balance of the Notes through a combination of cash on hand and with borrowings under the Credit Facility. Please refer to Note 10 Indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.\nAs of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants associated with the Credit Facility.\nOne of our financial goals is to maintain and improve our capital structure. The key metrics we focus on in assessing the strength of our liquidity and a summary of our cash activity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the tables below:\n\n (1) The Notes are shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their carrying value, which represents the principal balance of $189.8 million less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. \n Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. At June 30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents of $124.6 million consisted primarily of cash deposits held at major banks and money market funds. The $27.4 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from June 30, 2016 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $61.0 million and proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities of $47.0 million, partially offset by $28.2 million used for capital expenditures, including capitalization of software costs, cash used for purchases of available-for-sale securities of $14.1 million and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $39.9 million.\nAt June 30, 2017, our marketable securities of $2.0 million consisted primarily of U.S. corporate debt securities.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included approximately $59.3 million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017. Our current intention is to reinvest these amounts in the growth of our foreign operations. If our reinvestment plans change based on future events and we decide to repatriate these amounts to fund our domestic operations, the amounts would generally become subject to tax in the U.S. to the extent there were cumulative profits in the foreign subsidiary from which the distribution to the U.S. was made.\nCash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the British Pound, Euro and Swiss Franc to the U.S. Dollar increased our overall cash balances by approximately $0.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Further changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of these currencies could have a significant effect on our overall cash balances. However, we continue to believe that our existing cash balances, even in light of the foreign currency volatility we frequently experience, are adequate to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nOperating Activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income or loss for non-cash operating items, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, deferred income tax benefits or expenses, and impairment charges; and changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. Cash generated from operations decreased by $6.2 million for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year. In addition to the increase in our net loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year of $13.5 million, the decrease in cash generated from operations was primarily related to a decrease in cash flows from deferred revenue of $8.0 million, partially offset by an increase in cash flows from other assets of $5.3 million, accrued expenses of $2.8 million and non-cash adjustments to our net loss of $6.0 million.\nAt June 30, 2017, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $104.8 million which expire at various times through fiscal year 2037, Swiss net operating loss carryforwards of $25.8 million which expire in fiscal year 2024, Canadian net operating loss carryforwards of $0.3 million which expire principally in fiscal year 2035, and other foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $22.1 million, primarily in Europe and Israel, which have no statutory expiration date. We also have approximately $6.0 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards available which expire at various points through fiscal year 2037. Our operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt June 30, 2017, a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets have been reserved since, given the available evidence, it was deemed more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized.\nInvesting Activities. Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized software costs, investment purchases and sales and cash used for acquisition of businesses and assets. The $50.5 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 versus the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities of $31.2 million, a reduction in purchases of available-for-sale securities of $14.1 million and a reduction in purchases of cost-method investments of $4.0 million.\nFinancing Activities. Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. The $1.2 million decrease in cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock of $4.0 million, partially offset by debt issuance costs of $2.2 million related to our Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nFollowing is a summary of future payments that we are required to make under existing contractual obligations as of June 30, 2017:\n\n (1) The Credit Facility agreement includes a commitment fee, which we have included in the table above, based on the applicable interest rate as of June 30, 2017 and our unborrowed capacity of $300 million.  Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the\ntransaction. Obligations under contract that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nOur estimate of unrecognized tax benefits for which cash settlement may be required, in the amount of $1.4 million, has been excluded from the table above. These amounts have been excluded because, as of June 30, 2017, we are unable to estimate the timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with these liabilities as we do not currently anticipate settling any of these tax positions with cash payment in the foreseeable future.\nThe contractual obligations table above also excludes our estimate of the contributions we will make to our Swiss defined benefit pension plan in fiscal year 2018, which is $1.6 million based on foreign exchange rates in effect on June 30, 2017. We have not disclosed contributions for periods after fiscal year 2018, as those amounts are subject to future changes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.\n ", "item_7_tables": "Table 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and capital resources:\n\nCash Position\n- Cash and cash equivalents were $124.6 million as of June 30, 2017, up from $97.2 million a year earlier. The increase was primarily driven by cash from operations and proceeds from securities sales.\n\nCash Flow \n- Cash provided by operating activities was $61.0 million in fiscal 2017, down from $67.2 million the prior year. The decrease was largely due to changes in working capital.\n\n- Cash provided by investing activities was $4.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to cash used of $45.8 million the prior year. The difference was mainly due to less cash used for purchases of securities and investments in fiscal 2017.\n\n- Cash used in financing activities was $39.0 million in fiscal 2017 versus $40.2 million the prior year. The small decrease was largely driven by less cash used for share repurchases.\n\nDebt/Liquidity\n- The company has $189.8 million of convertible senior notes outstanding. It intends to repay the notes due in December 2017 using cash on hand and borrowings under its new $300 million credit facility.  \n\n- The company believes its existing liquidity sources will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs.\n\nThe company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements."}
