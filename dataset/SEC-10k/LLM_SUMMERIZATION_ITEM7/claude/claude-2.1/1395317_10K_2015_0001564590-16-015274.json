To the extent that any statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements that, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. These statements can be identified because they use words like anticipates\u201d, believes\u201d, estimates\u201d, expects\u201d, forecasts\u201d, future\u201d, intends\u201d, plans\u201d and similar terms. Specifically, statements referencing, without limitation, growth in sales of our products, profit margins and the sufficiency of our cash flow for future liquidity and capital resource needs may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, noted above. Results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results included in these statements as a result of these or other factors.\nIntroduction\nThis management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and where appropriate, factors that may affect future performance. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as the other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview of Business\nWe are a global developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-quality medical devices that provide solutions for musculoskeletal health, vascular health and pain management. Our products address the continuum of patient care from injury prevention to rehabilitation after surgery, injury or from degenerative disease, enabling people to regain or maintain their natural motion.\nOur products are used by orthopedic specialists, spine surgeons, primary care physicians, pain management specialists, physical therapists, podiatrists, chiropractors, athletic trainers and other healthcare professionals. In addition, many of our medical devices and related accessories are used by athletes and patients for injury prevention and at-home physical therapy treatment. Our product lines include rigid and soft orthopedic bracing, hot and cold therapy, bone growth stimulators, vascular therapy systems and compression garments, therapeutic shoes and inserts, electrical stimulators used for pain management and physical therapy products. Our surgical implant business offers a comprehensive suite of reconstructive joint products for the hip, knee and shoulder.\nOur products are marketed under a portfolio of brands including Aircast\u00ae, DonJoy\u00ae, Donjoy Performance\u00ae, ProCare\u00ae, CMF\u2122, Chattanooga, DJO Surgical, Dr. Comfort\u2122, Compex\u00ae, Bell-Horn\u2122 and Exos\u2122.\nOperating Segments\nThe company's continuing operations fall into four operating segments: Bracing and Vascular; Recovery Sciences; Surgical Implant; and International. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial and other additional information regarding our segments.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn June 30, 2015, our subsidiary Encore Medical, L.P., dba DJO Surgical, acquired certain assets from Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., including the Biomet Cobalt\u2122 Bone Cement, Optivac\u00ae Cement Mixing Accessories, SoftPac\u2122 Pouch and Discovery\u00ae Elbow System product lines.\nOn January 23, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Speetec Implantate GmbH ( Speetec\u201d). Speetec is a distributor and manufacturer of knee, hip and shoulder arthroplasty products in Germany.\nOn July 1, 2013 we acquired certain assets of Blue Leaf Medical CC ( Blue Leaf\u201d). The assets acquired relate to certain vascular product lines in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia.\nOn March 7, 2013 we acquired certain assets of Vasyli Medical Asia/Pacific Pty Ltd. ( Vasyli\u201d). The assets acquired relate to the distribution of certain vascular product lines in Australia and New Zealand.\nExit of Empi Business\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased manufacturing, selling and distributing products of our Empi business and the related insurance billing operations domestically. The Empi business primarily manufactured and sold TENS devices for pain relief, other electrotherapy and orthopedic products and the related supplies. Empi was facing a challenging regulatory and compliance environment, decreasing reimbursement rates and remained below the level needed to reach adequate profitability within an economically justified period of time. Empi was part of our Recovery Sciences operating segment. For financial statement purposes, the results of the Empi business are reported within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein.\nThe

</tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 (2015) Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 (2014)\nNet Sales. Net sales for 2015 were $1,113.7 million, compared to net sales of $1,087.6 million for 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which resulted in a decrease in net sales of $46.8 million, net sales increased 6.6% for the year ended 2015.

The increase is primarily due to new account acquisition in our OfficeCare channel, an increase in third party payor billing and growth in sales of direct consumer products.\nNet sales in our Recovery Sciences segment were $156.2 million for 2015, a decrease of 0.8% from net sales of $157.5 million for 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by continued slow market conditions affecting the sale of Chattanooga rehabilitation equipment, together with a mix shift in bone growth stimulation products from reimbursement to direct customers. The decrease was compensated by growth in retail sales of Compex electrostimulation devices.\nNet sales in our Surgical Implant segment were $134.8 million for 2015, an increase of 34.7% from net sales of $100.1 million for 2014. The increase was driven by sales of bone cement, which was acquired with the assets purchased from Zimmer Biomet in third quarter 2015. The segment also had strong organic growth in shoulder, hip and knee products due to new product introductions and new accounts.\nNet sales in our International segment were $296.3 million for 2015, a decrease of 8.9% from net sales of $325.3 million for 2014. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $46.8 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect during 2015 compared to the rates in effect in 2014, net sales increased 5.5% for 2015 compared to 2014. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by stronger sales in direct markets, primarily Germany and Spain, and increased sales penetration in emerging markets.\nCost of Sales. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales decreased to 41.9% for 2015, compared to 42.5% for 2014 mainly due to a mix between and within the reporting segments.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A). SG&A expenses increased to $454.7 million for 2015, from $439.9 million in 2014. The increase was mainly driven by acquisition and related integrations costs in our Surgical Implant segment, variable selling expenses due to growth and legal settlements, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts due to process improvements in our reimbursement channels and a reduction in expenses related to information technology projects.\nOur SG&A expenses are impacted by significant non-recurring integration charges and other adjustments related to our ongoing restructuring activities and acquisitions. We incurred the following SG&A expenses in connection with such activities during the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Integration charges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and global business unit reorganization\nand integration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition related expenses and integration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CFO transition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation and regulatory costs and settlements, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-recurring items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automation projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development (R&D). R&D expenses were $35.1 million for 2015, compared to $37.3 million in 2014, or 3.2% and 3.4% of net sales, respectively. In 2014 the company incurred consulting fees for testing, documentation and software implementation to enhance new product introductions and ensure FDA compliance. The company continues to focus on the development of new products, as well as the enhancement of existing products with the latest technology and updated designs, primarily our Bracing and Vascular and Surgical Implant segments.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $80.0 million for 2015, from $83.9 million for 2014. The decrease is due to certain intangible assets reaching full amortization primarily in our patents and technology category.\nInterest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net was $172.3 million for 2015 compared to $174.3 million for 2014. The decrease is due to lower weighted average interest rates on our senior secured credit facilities.\nLoss on Modification and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2015 consists of $47.8 million in premiums related to the redemption of our 8.75% Notes, 9.875% Notes and 7.75% Notes (each as defined herein), $11.9 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our debt that was extinguished and $8.8 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2014 consists of $0.3 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment of our prior senior secured credit facilities and $0.6 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our original term loans which were extinguished.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, increased to $7.3 million for 2015 from $5.2 million for 2014. Results for both periods presented primarily represent net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Provision. For 2015, we recorded an income tax provision of $12.3 million on a pre-tax loss of $170.3 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 7.2%. For 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $4.7 million on pre-tax losses of $116.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 4.1%.\nWe recorded income tax expense, although there were pretax losses, for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily because of the existence of a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance at the beginning of the period. The income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to foreign tax expense and the accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nASC 740-20 requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other comprehensive income and items charged directly to shareholders' equity. This allocation is referred to as intra-period tax allocation. The exit from the Empi business is reported under discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly we are required to allocate the provision for income taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a gain from discontinued operations, and, as a result, we recorded a tax expense of $17.6 million in discontinued operations and a corresponding tax benefit to continuing operations. The difference between the tax expense from discontinued operations, $17.6 million, and the tax benefit reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily relates to foreign tax expense and accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDiscontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased production, selling and billing operations of our Empi product line. Loss of $157.6 million was recognized for 2015, primarily consisting of asset impairment charges, net income from Empi operations, severance and other termination costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 (2014) Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 (2013)\nNet Sales. Our net sales for 2014 were $1,087.5 million, compared to net sales of $1,020.8 million for 2013, representing a 4.6% increase year over year. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $3.0 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect in 2014 compared to the rates in effect in 2013, net sales increased 4.8%.\nThe following table sets forth the mix of our net sales by business segment ($ in thousands):\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bracing and Vascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 504,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 476,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recovery Sciences\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 158,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (625\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Surgical Implant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 299,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,087,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,020,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in our Bracing and Vascular segment were $504.6 million for 2014, increasing 5.9% from net sales of $476.5 million for 2013. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by sales of new bracing and compression system products, as well as new account acquisition in our OfficeCare channel.\nNet sales in our Recovery Sciences segment were $157.5 million for 2014, decreasing 0.4% from net sales of $158.1 million for 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by slower than anticipated CMF product sales.\nNet sales in our Surgical Implant segment were $100.1 million for 2014, increasing 15.0% from net sales of $87.1 million for 2013. The increase was driven by strong sales of our shoulder and hip products due to new product introductions and new accounts.\nNet sales in our International segment were $325.3 million for 2014, increasing 8.8% from net sales of 299.1 million for 2013. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $3.0 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect in 2014 compared to the rates in effect in 2013, net sales for 2014 for the International segment increased 9.8% compared to net sales for 2013. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by sales from new products, improved sales execution, and increased sales penetration in certain geographies.\nCost of Sales. Costs of sales increased to $462.0 million for 2014, from $434.7 million for 2013. As a percentage of net sales, costs of sales remained fairly consistent at 42.5% for 2014, compared to 42.6% for 2013.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A). SG&A expenses increased to $439.9 million for 2014, from $409.2 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses remained fairly consistent at 40.5% for 2014, compared to 40.1% for 2013. The increase was driven by higher variable selling costs due to a relative increase in sales for the Bracing and Vascular and Surgical Implant segments, an increase in accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts in our reimbursement channels due to a trend in slower collections and an increase in reorganization and integration costs, offset by savings in wages and related costs of benefits.\nOur SG&A expenses are impacted by significant non-recurring integration charges and other adjustments related to our ongoing restructuring activities and acquisitions. We incurred the following SG&A expenses in connection with such activities during the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Integration charges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Global business unit reorganization and integration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition related expenses and integration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CFO transition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation and regulatory costs and settlements, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automation projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-recurring items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development (R&D). R&D expenses increased to $37.3 million for 2014, from $33.0 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expense increased to 3.4% in 2014 from 3.2% in 2013, primarily due to consulting fees for testing, documentation and software implementation to enhance new product introductions and ensure FDA compliance.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $83.9 million for 2014, from $86.4 million for 2013. The decrease is due to certain intangible assets reaching full amortization primarily in our patents and technology category, partially offset by an increase in intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of Speetec.\nInterest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net was $174.3 million for 2014 and $177.6 million for 2013. The decrease is due to lower weighted average interest rates on our senior secured credit facilities.\nLoss on Modification and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2014 consists of $0.3 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities and $0.6 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our original term loans which were extinguished. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2013 consists of $0.9 million in arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the March 2013 amendment of our senior secured credit facilities and $0.2 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with term loans which were extinguished.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net increased to $5.2 million for 2014, from $1.3 million for 2013. Results for both periods presented primarily represent net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Provision. We recorded income tax benefit of $4.7 million on pre-tax losses of $116.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 4.1% in 2014. For 2013, we recorded income tax expense of $17.5 million on pre-tax losses of $172.0 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 10.1%.\nWe recorded income tax expense, although there were pretax losses, for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily because of the existence of a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance at the beginning of the period. The income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to foreign tax expense and the accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nASC 740-20 requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other comprehensive income and items charged directly to shareholders' equity. This allocation is referred to as intra-period tax allocation. The exit from the Empi business is reported under discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly we are required to allocate the provision for income taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a gain from discontinued operations, and, as a result, we recorded a tax expense of $17.6 million in discontinued operations and a corresponding tax benefit to continuing operations. The difference between the tax expense from discontinued operations, $17.6 million, and the tax benefit reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily relates to foreign tax expense and accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDiscontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased production, selling and billing operations of our Empi product line. Discontinued operations for 2014 consisted primarily of net income from Empi operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard provides a five-step approach to be applied to all contracts with customers. The accounting standards update also requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the standard. The guidance is now effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as early as the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have to its consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to the presentation of debt issuance costs. The standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company has early adopted this update and the impact is reflected in the current and prior periods presented.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to internal-use software. The standard provides guidance to clarify the customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This guidance does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO). The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to the adjustments. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires all deferred income taxes be presented on the balance sheet as noncurrent. The new guidance is intended to simplify financial reporting by eliminating the requirement to classify deferred taxes between current and noncurrent. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has early adopted this update and the impact is reflected prospectively in the Company's financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance retains the current accounting for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans, but requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in net income, except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation. The guidance also changes the accounting for investments without a readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient permitted by the guidance to estimate fair value. A policy election can be made for these investments whereby estimated fair value may be measured at cost and adjusted in subsequent periods for any impairment or changes in observable prices of identical or similar investments. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which affects the accounting for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The amendment also will require qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are still assessing the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our primary sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling $48.9 million and our $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which $119.5 million was available. Our revolving credit balance was $30.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and we have provided a $0.5 million letter of credit related to collateral requirements under our product liability insurance policy. Working capital at December 31, 2015 was $218.3 million.\nWe believe that our existing cash, plus the amounts we expect to generate from operations and amounts available through our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our operating needs for the next twelve months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt and interest repayment obligations. While we currently believe that we will be able to meet all of the financial covenants imposed by our senior secured credit facilities, there is no assurance that we will in fact be able to do so or that, if we do not, we will be able to obtain from our lenders waivers of default or amendments to the senior secured credit facilities.\nAs market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including Blackstone, its affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time, seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the notes and borrowings under our credit facilities, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the adjusted issue price\u201d (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.\nCash Flows\nOperating activities from continuing operations provided $9.7 million and used $7.4 million and $24.0 million of cash for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash from operating activities for all years presented primarily represented our net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital. In 2015 and 2014, changes in working capital largely consisted of increases in inventories which used cash of $8.1 million and $19.5 million, respectively and provided cash of $3.2 million in 2013. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, cash paid for interest was $176.7 million, $165.5 million and $171.4 million, respectively.\nInvesting activities from continuing operations used $68.1 million, $58.4 million, and $41.1 million of cash for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. Cash used in investing activities for 2015 was for purchases of property and equipment primarily for the acquisition\nof certain surgical assets from Zimmer Biomet, consigned surgical instruments and vascular system pumps used as rental units, IT automation technology and manufacturing equipment for new products and more efficient production. Cash used in investing activities for 2014 primarily consisted of $52.7 million for purchases of property and equipment primarily for surgical instruments to support growth, IT automation technology, manufacturing equipment for new products and more efficient production, and $4.6 million related to the acquisition of Speetec. Cash used in investing activities for 2013 primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $37.5 million primarily for surgical instruments and IT automation technology, and $2.0 million related to the acquisition of assets from our vascular distributors in Australia and South Africa.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $36.1 million in 2015, used cash of $23 thousand in 2014 and provided $23.3 million of cash in 2013, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2015 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings related to the refinancing of our debt, offset by the repayments of our prior senior secured credit facilities and our 8.75% Notes, 9.875% Notes and 7.75% Notes. Cash used in financing activities in 2014 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, offset by payments of the senior secured credit facilities, payments related to the repurchase of Rollover Options from our former chief financial officer upon her departure, and payment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Exos. Cash provided in financing activities in 2013 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, offset by payments of the senior secured credit facilities.\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $2,397.4 million in aggregate indebtedness outstanding, exclusive of a net unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $42.3 million.

Our revolving credit balance was $30.0 million at December 31, 2015 and we have provided a $0.5 million letter of credit related to collateral requirements under our product liability insurance policy.\nWe are required to repay installments on the term loans in quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, with the remaining amount payable at maturity in June 2020.\nNotes. Our outstanding notes mature at various dates in 2020 and 2021, with $1.5 million of our 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes remaining outstanding due in 2017. Assuming we are in compliance with the terms of the indentures governing the notes, we are not required to repay principal related to any of the notes prior to their final maturity dates of the notes. We pay interest semi-annually on the notes.\nSee Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness.\nCertain Covenants and Related Compliance. Our Term Loan requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of debt from our Credit Facilities, net of cash, to Adjusted EBITDA of no higher than 5.35:1, computed on a trailing twelve month period commencing with September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL plus: net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items, as described in our Term Loan agreement. As of December 31, 2015, our actual first lien net leverage ratio was 4.15:1, meeting the requirement.\nOur debt agreements restrict our ability to incur additional debt and make certain payments. The indentures for our Notes generally permit additional debt only if the ratio of our Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges is at least 2.00:1, or, in the case of additional debt to finance an acquisition, such ratio improves on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such incurrence. Our Credit Facilities permit us to incur additional debt for an acquisition only if the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to debt, net of cash, improves or is no higher than 7.50:1, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to acquisition and additional debt. The indentures for our Notes generally prevent us from making certain payments, such as dividends and junior debt prepayments, unless the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges is at least 2.00:1 on a pro forma basis. Our ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was 1.49:1. Fixed charges, as defined in the indentures, generally means consolidated interest expense plus all cash dividends or other distributions paid on equity.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income (loss) or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in our debt agreements allows us to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net loss. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.\nAs described above, our Credit Facilities and Notes represent significant components of our capital structure. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Credit Facilities and Notes. If we fail to comply with the leverage and other requirements of our Credit Facilities and Notes, we would be in default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders and the trustee for the Notes could, subject to certain provisions described in the agreements by which we can cure the default, declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. Our ability to meet the covenants described in our Credit Facilities and Notes will depend on future events, some of which are beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those covenants.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from our net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The terms and related calculations are defined in the credit agreement relating to our senior secured credit facilities and the Indentures.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to DJO Finance LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (340,927\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (90,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (203,452\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss (income) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,742\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 172,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 174,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 177,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,720\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash charges (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-recurring and integration charges (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other adjustment items (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 239,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 231,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permitted pro forma adjustments (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future cost savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 248,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 209,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Non-cash items are comprised of the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase accounting adjustments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,568\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on disposal of assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (761\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-cash items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of $49.6 million related to the Chattanooga reporting unit.

In addition, under the amended transaction and monitoring fee agreement entered into in November 2007, the purchase obligations shown above include DJO's obligation to pay a $7.0 million annual monitoring fee to Blackstone Management Partners V L.L.C. through 2019. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\u201d for a more detailed description of the monitoring fee agreement.\nThe amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirement because the actual timing of future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to reserves for contractual allowances, doubtful accounts, rebates, product returns, goodwill and intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities and inventory. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent that actual events differ from our estimates and assumptions, there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations.\nReserves for Contractual Allowances, Doubtful Accounts, Rebates, Product Returns\nWe have established reserves to account for contractual allowances, doubtful accounts, rebates and product returns. Significant management judgment must be used and estimates must be made in connection with establishing these reserves.\nWe maintain provisions for estimated contractual allowances for reimbursement amounts from our third party payor customers based on negotiated contracts and historical experience for non-contracted payors. We report these allowances as reductions to our gross revenue. We estimate the amount of the reduction based on historical experience and invoices generated in the period, and we consider the impact of new contract terms or modifications of existing arrangements with our customers. We have contracts with certain third party payors for our third party reimbursement billings, which call for specified reductions in reimbursement of billed amounts based upon contractual reimbursement rates. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reserved for and reduced gross revenues from third party payors by estimated contractual allowances of 36%, 35%, and 40%, respectively.\nOur reserve for doubtful accounts is based upon estimated losses from customers who are billed directly and the portion of third party reimbursement billings that ultimately become the financial responsibility of the end user patients. Direct-billed customers represented approximately 66%, 66%, and 73% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Direct-billed customers represented approximately 64% and 67% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We experienced write-offs related to direct-billed customers of less than 1% of related net revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOur third party reimbursement customers including insurance companies, managed care companies and certain governmental payors, such as Medicare, include all of our OfficeCare customers, most of our Empi customers, and certain other customers of our Recovery Sciences and Bracing and Vascular segments. Our third party payor customers represented approximately 34%, 34%, and 27% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Third party payor customers represented approximately 36% and 33%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we estimate bad debt expense to be approximately 6% of gross revenues from these third party reimbursement customers. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if third party payors were to deny claims for late filings, incomplete information or other reasons, additional provisions may be required. Additions to this reserve are reflected as Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur reserve for rebates accounts for incentives that we offer certain of our distributors. These rebates are substantially attributable to sales volume, sales growth or to reimburse the distributor for certain discounts. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebate programs based upon historical experience and estimated revenue levels.\nOur reserve for product returns accounts for estimated customer returns of our products after purchase. These returns are mainly attributable to a third party payor's refusal to provide reimbursement for the product or the inability of the product to adequately address the patient's condition. We provide for this reserve by reducing gross revenue based on our historical rate of returns.\nInventory Reserves\nWe provide reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories on hand and the costs of projected inventories required based upon assumptions about future demand. If future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We also provide reserves for newer product inventories, as appropriate, based on any minimum purchase commitments and our level of sales of the new products.\nWe consign a portion of our inventory to allow our products to be immediately dispensed to patients. This requires inventory to be on hand for the products we sell through consignment arrangements. It also increases the sensitivity of these products to obsolescence reserve estimates. As this inventory is not in our possession, we maintain additional reserves for estimated shrinkage of these inventories based on the results of periodic inventory counts and historical trends.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.\nIn performing our 2015 goodwill impairment test, we estimated the fair values of our reporting units using the income approach which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which includes the use of market multiples. These fair value measurements are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes, and required significant judgment with respect to forecasted sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, income taxes, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. For purposes of calculating the discounted cash flows of our reporting units, we used estimated revenue growth rates averaging between 1% and 15% for the discrete forecast period. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies. Future cash flows were then discounted to present value at discount rates ranging from 8.9% to 10.6%, and terminal value growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. Publicly available information regarding comparable market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow\nmethodology. We determined that the fair value of the six reporting units with goodwill assigned to them exceeds their carrying value and no reporting unit was at risk of failing the test. The percentage by which the fair value of the six reporting units exceeded their carrying value ranged from 31.4% to 133.5%. As such, we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015 we tested our indefinite lived trade name intangible assets for impairment. This test work compares the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. To determine the fair value we applied the relief from royalty (RFR) method. Under the RFR method, the value of the trade name is determined by calculating the present value of the after-tax cost savings associated with owning the asset and therefore not being required to pay royalties for its use during the asset's indefinite life. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating future cash flows and the identification of appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the projected future cash generated by the respective intangible assets. Future cash flows were discounted to present value at discount rates ranging from 8.9% to 10.6%, and terminal value growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. Also subject to judgment are assumptions about royalty rates, which are based on the estimated rates at which similar brands and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace. We used market average royalty rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.0%. These fair value measurements are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We determined that that the fair value of these trade names exceed their carrying value. The percentage by which the fair value of these trade names exceeded their carrying value ranged from 24.0% to 160.1%. As such, we determined that these indefinite lived intangible assets are not impaired.\nThe estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business, however, it is possible that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur significant impairment charges.\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets, liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards. We establish valuation allowances when the recovery of a deferred tax asset is not likely based on historical income, projected future income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies.\nWe generated additional deferred tax liabilities related to tax amortization of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets because these assets were not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax amortization in current and future years gives rise to a deferred tax liability which will only reverse at the time of ultimate sale or book impairment. Due to the uncertain timing of this reversal, the temporary differences associated with indefinite lived intangibles cannot be considered a source of future taxable income for purposes of determining a valuation allowance. As such, the deferred tax liability cannot be used to offset the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss carry forward for tax purposes that is generated by the same amortization. This naked credit\u201d gives rise to the need for additional valuation allowance.\nOur gross deferred tax asset balance was $327.7 million at December 31, 2015 and is primarily related to reserves for accounts receivable and inventory, accrued expenses, and net operating loss carryforwards (see Note 15 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein). As of December 31, 2015, we maintained a valuation allowance of $223.4 million due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize certain deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance maintained is primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards not expected to be realized.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward Looking Statements\nThis report, and the following management's discussion and analysis, contain forward looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as the other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview of Business\nWe are a global developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-quality medical devices that provide solutions for musculoskeletal health, vascular health and pain management. Our products address the continuum of patient care from injury prevention to rehabilitation after surgery, injury or from degenerative disease, enabling people to regain or maintain their natural motion.\nOur products are used by orthopedic specialists, spine surgeons, primary care physicians, pain management specialists, physical therapists, podiatrists, chiropractors, athletic trainers and other healthcare professionals. In addition, many of our medical devices and related accessories are used by athletes and patients for injury prevention and at-home physical therapy treatment. Our product lines include rigid and soft orthopedic bracing, hot and cold therapy, bone growth stimulators, vascular therapy systems and compression garments, therapeutic shoes and inserts, electrical stimulators used for pain management and physical therapy products. Our surgical implant business offers a comprehensive suite of reconstructive joint products for the hip, knee and shoulder.\nOur products are marketed under a portfolio of brands including Aircast\u00ae, DonJoy\u00ae, Donjoy Performance\u00ae, ProCare\u00ae, CMF\u2122, Chattanooga, DJO Surgical, Dr. Comfort\u2122, Compex\u00ae, Bell-Horn\u2122 and Exos\u2122.\nOperating Segments\nThe company's continuing operations fall into four operating segments: Bracing and Vascular; Recovery Sciences; Surgical Implant; and International. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial and other additional information regarding our segments.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn June 30, 2015, our subsidiary Encore Medical, L.P., dba DJO Surgical, acquired certain assets from Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., including the Biomet Cobalt\u2122 Bone Cement, Optivac\u00ae Cement Mixing Accessories, SoftPac\u2122 Pouch and Discovery\u00ae Elbow System product lines.\nOn January 23, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Speetec Implantate GmbH ( Speetec\u201d). Speetec is a distributor and manufacturer of knee, hip and shoulder arthroplasty products in Germany.\nOn July 1, 2013 we acquired certain assets of Blue Leaf Medical CC ( Blue Leaf\u201d). The assets acquired relate to certain vascular product lines in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia.\nOn March 7, 2013 we acquired certain assets of Vasyli Medical Asia/Pacific Pty Ltd. ( Vasyli\u201d). The assets acquired relate to the distribution of certain vascular product lines in Australia and New Zealand.\nExit of Empi Business\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased manufacturing, selling and distributing products of our Empi business and the related insurance billing operations domestically. The Empi business primarily manufactured and sold TENS devices for pain relief, other electrotherapy and orthopedic products and the related supplies. Empi was facing a challenging regulatory and compliance environment, decreasing reimbursement rates and remained below the level needed to reach adequate profitability within an economically justified period of time. Empi was part of our Recovery Sciences operating segment. For financial statement purposes, the results of the Empi business are reported within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein.\nThe following table sets forth our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales ($ in thousands):\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

exclusive of amortization of intangible assets of $30,719, $32,962, and $33,719 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nYear Ended December 31, 2015 (2015) Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 (2014)\nNet Sales. Net sales for 2015 were $1,113.7 million, compared to net sales of $1,087.6 million for 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which resulted in a decrease in net sales of $46.8 million, net sales increased 6.6% for the year ended 2015. Net sales from acquisitions completed in 2015 were $18.4 million. The results of the Company's non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results.\nThe following table sets forth the mix of our net sales by business segment ($ in thousands):\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bracing and Vascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 526,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 504,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recovery Sciences\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 156,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,291\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Surgical Implant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 134,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 296,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,020\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,113,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,087,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in our Bracing and Vascular segment were $526.3 million for 2015, an increase of 4.3% from net sales of $504.6 million for 2014. The increase is primarily due to new account acquisition in our OfficeCare channel, an increase in third party payor billing and growth in sales of direct consumer products.\nNet sales in our Recovery Sciences segment were $156.2 million for 2015, a decrease of 0.8% from net sales of $157.5 million for 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by continued slow market conditions affecting the sale of Chattanooga rehabilitation equipment, together with a mix shift in bone growth stimulation products from reimbursement to direct customers. The decrease was compensated by growth in retail sales of Compex electrostimulation devices.\nNet sales in our Surgical Implant segment were $134.8 million for 2015, an increase of 34.7% from net sales of $100.1 million for 2014. The increase was driven by sales of bone cement, which was acquired with the assets purchased from Zimmer Biomet in third quarter 2015. The segment also had strong organic growth in shoulder, hip and knee products due to new product introductions and new accounts.\nNet sales in our International segment were $296.3 million for 2015, a decrease of 8.9% from net sales of $325.3 million for 2014. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $46.8 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect during 2015 compared to the rates in effect in 2014, net sales increased 5.5% for 2015 compared to 2014. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by stronger sales in direct markets, primarily Germany and Spain, and increased sales penetration in emerging markets.\nCost of Sales. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales decreased to 41.9% for 2015, compared to 42.5% for 2014 mainly due to a mix between and within the reporting segments.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A). SG&A expenses increased to $454.7 million for 2015, from $439.9 million in 2014. The increase was mainly driven by acquisition and related integrations costs in our Surgical Implant segment, variable selling expenses due to growth and legal settlements, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts due to process improvements in our reimbursement channels and a reduction in expenses related to information technology projects.\nOur SG&A expenses are impacted by significant non-recurring integration charges and other adjustments related to our ongoing restructuring activities and acquisitions. We incurred the following SG&A expenses in connection with such activities during the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Integration charges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and global business unit reorganization\nand integration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition related expenses and integration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CFO transition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation and regulatory costs and settlements, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-recurring items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automation projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development (R&D). R&D expenses were $35.1 million for 2015, compared to $37.3 million in 2014, or 3.2% and 3.4% of net sales, respectively. In 2014 the company incurred consulting fees for testing, documentation and software implementation to enhance new product introductions and ensure FDA compliance. The company continues to focus on the development of new products, as well as the enhancement of existing products with the latest technology and updated designs, primarily our Bracing and Vascular and Surgical Implant segments.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $80.0 million for 2015, from $83.9 million for 2014. The decrease is due to certain intangible assets reaching full amortization primarily in our patents and technology category.\nInterest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net was $172.3 million for 2015 compared to $174.3 million for 2014. The decrease is due to lower weighted average interest rates on our senior secured credit facilities.\nLoss on Modification and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2015 consists of $47.8 million in premiums related to the redemption of our 8.75% Notes, 9.875% Notes and 7.75% Notes (each as defined herein), $11.9 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our debt that was extinguished and $8.8 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2014 consists of $0.3 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment of our prior senior secured credit facilities and $0.6 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our original term loans which were extinguished.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, increased to $7.3 million for 2015 from $5.2 million for 2014. Results for both periods presented primarily represent net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Provision. For 2015, we recorded an income tax provision of $12.3 million on a pre-tax loss of $170.3 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 7.2%. For 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $4.7 million on pre-tax losses of $116.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 4.1%.\nWe recorded income tax expense, although there were pretax losses, for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily because of the existence of a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance at the beginning of the period. The income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to foreign tax expense and the accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nASC 740-20 requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other comprehensive income and items charged directly to shareholders' equity. This allocation is referred to as intra-period tax allocation. The exit from the Empi business is reported under discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly we are required to allocate the provision for income taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a gain from discontinued operations, and, as a result, we recorded a tax expense of $17.6 million in discontinued operations and a corresponding tax benefit to continuing operations. The difference between the tax expense from discontinued operations, $17.6 million, and the tax benefit reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily relates to foreign tax expense and accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDiscontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased production, selling and billing operations of our Empi product line. Loss of $157.6 million was recognized for 2015, primarily consisting of asset impairment charges, net income from Empi operations, severance and other termination costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 (2014) Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 (2013)\nNet Sales. Our net sales for 2014 were $1,087.5 million, compared to net sales of $1,020.8 million for 2013, representing a 4.6% increase year over year. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $3.0 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect in 2014 compared to the rates in effect in 2013, net sales increased 4.8%.\nThe following table sets forth the mix of our net sales by business segment ($ in thousands):\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Net\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bracing and Vascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 504,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 476,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recovery Sciences\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 158,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (625\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Surgical Implant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 299,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,087,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,020,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in our Bracing and Vascular segment were $504.6 million for 2014, increasing 5.9% from net sales of $476.5 million for 2013. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by sales of new bracing and compression system products, as well as new account acquisition in our OfficeCare channel.\nNet sales in our Recovery Sciences segment were $157.5 million for 2014, decreasing 0.4% from net sales of $158.1 million for 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by slower than anticipated CMF product sales.\nNet sales in our Surgical Implant segment were $100.1 million for 2014, increasing 15.0% from net sales of $87.1 million for 2013. The increase was driven by strong sales of our shoulder and hip products due to new product introductions and new accounts.\nNet sales in our International segment were $325.3 million for 2014, increasing 8.8% from net sales of 299.1 million for 2013. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $3.0 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect in 2014 compared to the rates in effect in 2013, net sales for 2014 for the International segment increased 9.8% compared to net sales for 2013. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by sales from new products, improved sales execution, and increased sales penetration in certain geographies.\nCost of Sales. Costs of sales increased to $462.0 million for 2014, from $434.7 million for 2013. As a percentage of net sales, costs of sales remained fairly consistent at 42.5% for 2014, compared to 42.6% for 2013.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A). SG&A expenses increased to $439.9 million for 2014, from $409.2 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses remained fairly consistent at 40.5% for 2014, compared to 40.1% for 2013. The increase was driven by higher variable selling costs due to a relative increase in sales for the Bracing and Vascular and Surgical Implant segments, an increase in accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts in our reimbursement channels due to a trend in slower collections and an increase in reorganization and integration costs, offset by savings in wages and related costs of benefits.\nOur SG&A expenses are impacted by significant non-recurring integration charges and other adjustments related to our ongoing restructuring activities and acquisitions. We incurred the following SG&A expenses in connection with such activities during the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Integration charges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Global business unit reorganization and integration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition related expenses and integration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CFO transition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation and regulatory costs and settlements, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automation projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-recurring items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development (R&D). R&D expenses increased to $37.3 million for 2014, from $33.0 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expense increased to 3.4% in 2014 from 3.2% in 2013, primarily due to consulting fees for testing, documentation and software implementation to enhance new product introductions and ensure FDA compliance.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $83.9 million for 2014, from $86.4 million for 2013. The decrease is due to certain intangible assets reaching full amortization primarily in our patents and technology category, partially offset by an increase in intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of Speetec.\nInterest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net was $174.3 million for 2014 and $177.6 million for 2013. The decrease is due to lower weighted average interest rates on our senior secured credit facilities.\nLoss on Modification and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2014 consists of $0.3 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities and $0.6 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our original term loans which were extinguished. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2013 consists of $0.9 million in arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the March 2013 amendment of our senior secured credit facilities and $0.2 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with term loans which were extinguished.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net increased to $5.2 million for 2014, from $1.3 million for 2013. Results for both periods presented primarily represent net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Provision. We recorded income tax benefit of $4.7 million on pre-tax losses of $116.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 4.1% in 2014. For 2013, we recorded income tax expense of $17.5 million on pre-tax losses of $172.0 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 10.1%.\nWe recorded income tax expense, although there were pretax losses, for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily because of the existence of a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance at the beginning of the period. The income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to foreign tax expense and the accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nASC 740-20 requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other comprehensive income and items charged directly to shareholders' equity. This allocation is referred to as intra-period tax allocation. The exit from the Empi business is reported under discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly we are required to allocate the provision for income taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a gain from discontinued operations, and, as a result, we recorded a tax expense of $17.6 million in discontinued operations and a corresponding tax benefit to continuing operations. The difference between the tax expense from discontinued operations, $17.6 million, and the tax benefit reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily relates to foreign tax expense and accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDiscontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased production, selling and billing operations of our Empi product line. Discontinued operations for 2014 consisted primarily of net income from Empi operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard provides a five-step approach to be applied to all contracts with customers. The accounting standards update also requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the standard. The guidance is now effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as early as the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have to its consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to the presentation of debt issuance costs. The standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company has early adopted this update and the impact is reflected in the current and prior periods presented.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to internal-use software. The standard provides guidance to clarify the customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This guidance does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO). The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to the adjustments. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires all deferred income taxes be presented on the balance sheet as noncurrent. The new guidance is intended to simplify financial reporting by eliminating the requirement to classify deferred taxes between current and noncurrent. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has early adopted this update and the impact is reflected prospectively in the Company's financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance retains the current accounting for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans, but requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in net income, except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation. The guidance also changes the accounting for investments without a readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient permitted by the guidance to estimate fair value. A policy election can be made for these investments whereby estimated fair value may be measured at cost and adjusted in subsequent periods for any impairment or changes in observable prices of identical or similar investments. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which affects the accounting for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The amendment also will require qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are still assessing the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our primary sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling $48.9 million and our $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which $119.5 million was available. Our revolving credit balance was $30.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and we have provided a $0.5 million letter of credit related to collateral requirements under our product liability insurance policy. Working capital at December 31, 2015 was $218.3 million.\nWe believe that our existing cash, plus the amounts we expect to generate from operations and amounts available through our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our operating needs for the next twelve months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt and interest repayment obligations. While we currently believe that we will be able to meet all of the financial covenants imposed by our senior secured credit facilities, there is no assurance that we will in fact be able to do so or that, if we do not, we will be able to obtain from our lenders waivers of default or amendments to the senior secured credit facilities.\nAs market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including Blackstone, its affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time, seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the notes and borrowings under our credit facilities, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the adjusted issue price\u201d (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.\nCash Flows\nOperating activities from continuing operations provided $9.7 million and used $7.4 million and $24.0 million of cash for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash from operating activities for all years presented primarily represented our net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital. In 2015 and 2014, changes in working capital largely consisted of increases in inventories which used cash of $8.1 million and $19.5 million, respectively and provided cash of $3.2 million in 2013. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, cash paid for interest was $176.7 million, $165.5 million and $171.4 million, respectively.\nInvesting activities from continuing operations used $68.1 million, $58.4 million, and $41.1 million of cash for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. Cash used in investing activities for 2015 was for purchases of property and equipment primarily for the acquisition\nof certain surgical assets from Zimmer Biomet, consigned surgical instruments and vascular system pumps used as rental units, IT automation technology and manufacturing equipment for new products and more efficient production. Cash used in investing activities for 2014 primarily consisted of $52.7 million for purchases of property and equipment primarily for surgical instruments to support growth, IT automation technology, manufacturing equipment for new products and more efficient production, and $4.6 million related to the acquisition of Speetec. Cash used in investing activities for 2013 primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $37.5 million primarily for surgical instruments and IT automation technology, and $2.0 million related to the acquisition of assets from our vascular distributors in Australia and South Africa.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $36.1 million in 2015, used cash of $23 thousand in 2014 and provided $23.3 million of cash in 2013, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2015 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings related to the refinancing of our debt, offset by the repayments of our prior senior secured credit facilities and our 8.75% Notes, 9.875% Notes and 7.75% Notes. Cash used in financing activities in 2014 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, offset by payments of the senior secured credit facilities, payments related to the repurchase of Rollover Options from our former chief financial officer upon her departure, and payment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Exos. Cash provided in financing activities in 2013 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, offset by payments of the senior secured credit facilities.\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $2,397.4 million in aggregate indebtedness outstanding, exclusive of a net unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $42.3 million. The principal amount and carrying value of our debt was as follows for December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,052,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,037,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 884,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 871,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,082,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,065,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 901,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 887,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 8.125% Second Lien Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,015,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 998,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 8.75% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 330,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9.875% Senior Unsecured Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 440,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 433,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 7.75% Senior Unsecured Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 295,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10.75% Third Lien Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 296,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,315,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,290,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,370,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,354,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total indebtedness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,397,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,355,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,271,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,242,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facilities.\nOur credit facilities at December 31, 2015 consisted of $1,055.0 million term loans (the Term Loan\u201d) and a $150.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Facility\u201d), which mature on June 7, 2020 (collectively, the Credit Facilities\u201d). Our revolving credit balance was $30.0 million at December 31, 2015 and we have provided a $0.5 million letter of credit related to collateral requirements under our product liability insurance policy.\nWe are required to repay installments on the term loans in quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, with the remaining amount payable at maturity in June 2020.\nNotes. Our outstanding notes mature at various dates in 2020 and 2021, with $1.5 million of our 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes remaining outstanding due in 2017. Assuming we are in compliance with the terms of the indentures governing the notes, we are not required to repay principal related to any of the notes prior to their final maturity dates of the notes. We pay interest semi-annually on the notes.\nSee Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness.\nCertain Covenants and Related Compliance. Our Term Loan requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of debt from our Credit Facilities, net of cash, to Adjusted EBITDA of no higher than 5.35:1, computed on a trailing twelve month period commencing with September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL plus: net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items, as described in our Term Loan agreement. As of December 31, 2015, our actual first lien net leverage ratio was 4.15:1, meeting the requirement.\nOur debt agreements restrict our ability to incur additional debt and make certain payments. The indentures for our Notes generally permit additional debt only if the ratio of our Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges is at least 2.00:1, or, in the case of additional debt to finance an acquisition, such ratio improves on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such incurrence. Our Credit Facilities permit us to incur additional debt for an acquisition only if the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to debt, net of cash, improves or is no higher than 7.50:1, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to acquisition and additional debt. The indentures for our Notes generally prevent us from making certain payments, such as dividends and junior debt prepayments, unless the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges is at least 2.00:1 on a pro forma basis. Our ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was 1.49:1. Fixed charges, as defined in the indentures, generally means consolidated interest expense plus all cash dividends or other distributions paid on equity.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income (loss) or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in our debt agreements allows us to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net loss. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.\nAs described above, our Credit Facilities and Notes represent significant components of our capital structure. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Credit Facilities and Notes. If we fail to comply with the leverage and other requirements of our Credit Facilities and Notes, we would be in default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders and the trustee for the Notes could, subject to certain provisions described in the agreements by which we can cure the default, declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. Our ability to meet the covenants described in our Credit Facilities and Notes will depend on future events, some of which are beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those covenants.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from our net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The terms and related calculations are defined in the credit agreement relating to our senior secured credit facilities and the Indentures.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to DJO Finance LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (340,927\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (90,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (203,452\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss (income) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,742\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 172,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 174,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 177,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,720\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash charges (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-recurring and integration charges (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other adjustment items (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 239,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 231,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permitted pro forma adjustments (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future cost savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 248,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 209,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Non-cash items are comprised of the following: \nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase accounting adjustments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,568\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on disposal of assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (761\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-cash items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of $49.6 million related to the Chattanooga reporting unit.

principal amount of long-term debt is subject to fixed interest rates and $1,082.3 million of principal amount of long-term debt is subject to a floating interest rate. Interest payments for the floating rate debt were determined using an average assumed effective interest rate of 4.25%, which is equal to the average assumed effective interest rate for the term loans under the credit facilities over the remainder of their term. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had entered into purchase commitments for inventory, capital expenditures and other services totaling $69.5 million in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under the amended transaction and monitoring fee agreement entered into in November 2007, the purchase obligations shown above include DJO's obligation to pay a $7.0 million annual monitoring fee to Blackstone Management Partners V L.L.C. through 2019. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\u201d for a more detailed description of the monitoring fee agreement.\nThe amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirement because the actual timing of future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to reserves for contractual allowances, doubtful accounts, rebates, product returns, goodwill and intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities and inventory. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent that actual events differ from our estimates and assumptions, there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations.\nReserves for Contractual Allowances, Doubtful Accounts, Rebates, Product Returns\nWe have established reserves to account for contractual allowances, doubtful accounts, rebates and product returns. Significant management judgment must be used and estimates must be made in connection with establishing these reserves.\nWe maintain provisions for estimated contractual allowances for reimbursement amounts from our third party payor customers based on negotiated contracts and historical experience for non-contracted payors. We report these allowances as reductions to our gross revenue. We estimate the amount of the reduction based on historical experience and invoices generated in the period, and we consider the impact of new contract terms or modifications of existing arrangements with our customers. We have contracts with certain third party payors for our third party reimbursement billings, which call for specified reductions in reimbursement of billed amounts based upon contractual reimbursement rates. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reserved for and reduced gross revenues from third party payors by estimated contractual allowances of 36%, 35%, and 40%, respectively.\nOur reserve for doubtful accounts is based upon estimated losses from customers who are billed directly and the portion of third party reimbursement billings that ultimately become the financial responsibility of the end user patients. Direct-billed customers represented approximately 66%, 66%, and 73% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Direct-billed customers represented approximately 64% and 67% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We experienced write-offs related to direct-billed customers of less than 1% of related net revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOur third party reimbursement customers including insurance companies, managed care companies and certain governmental payors, such as Medicare, include all of our OfficeCare customers, most of our Empi customers, and certain other customers of our Recovery Sciences and Bracing and Vascular segments. Our third party payor customers represented approximately 34%, 34%, and 27% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Third party payor customers represented approximately 36% and 33%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we estimate bad debt expense to be approximately 6% of gross revenues from these third party reimbursement customers. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if third party payors were to deny claims for late filings, incomplete information or other reasons, additional provisions may be required. Additions to this reserve are reflected as Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur reserve for rebates accounts for incentives that we offer certain of our distributors. These rebates are substantially attributable to sales volume, sales growth or to reimburse the distributor for certain discounts. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebate programs based upon historical experience and estimated revenue levels.\nOur reserve for product returns accounts for estimated customer returns of our products after purchase. These returns are mainly attributable to a third party payor's refusal to provide reimbursement for the product or the inability of the product to adequately address the patient's condition. We provide for this reserve by reducing gross revenue based on our historical rate of returns.\nInventory Reserves\nWe provide reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories on hand and the costs of projected inventories required based upon assumptions about future demand. If future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We also provide reserves for newer product inventories, as appropriate, based on any minimum purchase commitments and our level of sales of the new products.\nWe consign a portion of our inventory to allow our products to be immediately dispensed to patients. This requires inventory to be on hand for the products we sell through consignment arrangements. It also increases the sensitivity of these products to obsolescence reserve estimates. As this inventory is not in our possession, we maintain additional reserves for estimated shrinkage of these inventories based on the results of periodic inventory counts and historical trends.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.\nIn performing our 2015 goodwill impairment test, we estimated the fair values of our reporting units using the income approach which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which includes the use of market multiples. These fair value measurements are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes, and required significant judgment with respect to forecasted sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, income taxes, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. For purposes of calculating the discounted cash flows of our reporting units, we used estimated revenue growth rates averaging between 1% and 15% for the discrete forecast period. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies. Future cash flows were then discounted to present value at discount rates ranging from 8.9% to 10.6%, and terminal value growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. Publicly available information regarding comparable market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow\nmethodology. We determined that the fair value of the six reporting units with goodwill assigned to them exceeds their carrying value and no reporting unit was at risk of failing the test. The percentage by which the fair value of the six reporting units exceeded their carrying value ranged from 31.4% to 133.5%. As such, we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015 we tested our indefinite lived trade name intangible assets for impairment. This test work compares the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. To determine the fair value we applied the relief from royalty (RFR) method. Under the RFR method, the value of the trade name is determined by calculating the present value of the after-tax cost savings associated with owning the asset and therefore not being required to pay royalties for its use during the asset's indefinite life. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating future cash flows and the identification of appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the projected future cash generated by the respective intangible assets. Future cash flows were discounted to present value at discount rates ranging from 8.9% to 10.6%, and terminal value growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. Also subject to judgment are assumptions about royalty rates, which are based on the estimated rates at which similar brands and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace. We used market average royalty rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.0%. These fair value measurements are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We determined that that the fair value of these trade names exceed their carrying value. The percentage by which the fair value of these trade names exceeded their carrying value ranged from 24.0% to 160.1%. As such, we determined that these indefinite lived intangible assets are not impaired.\nThe estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business, however, it is possible that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur significant impairment charges.\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets, liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards. We establish valuation allowances when the recovery of a deferred tax asset is not likely based on historical income, projected future income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies.\nWe generated additional deferred tax liabilities related to tax amortization of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets because these assets were not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax amortization in current and future years gives rise to a deferred tax liability which will only reverse at the time of ultimate sale or book impairment. Due to the uncertain timing of this reversal, the temporary differences associated with indefinite lived intangibles cannot be considered a source of future taxable income for purposes of determining a valuation allowance. As such, the deferred tax liability cannot be used to offset the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss carry forward for tax purposes that is generated by the same amortization. This naked credit\u201d gives rise to the need for additional valuation allowance.\nOur gross deferred tax asset balance was $327.7 million at December 31, 2015 and is primarily related to reserves for accounts receivable and inventory, accrued expenses, and net operating loss carryforwards (see Note 15 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein). As of December 31, 2015, we maintained a valuation allowance of $223.4 million due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize certain deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance maintained is primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards not expected to be realized.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward Looking Statements\nThis report, and the following management's discussion and analysis, contain forward looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as the other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview of Business\nWe are a global developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-quality medical devices that provide solutions for musculoskeletal health, vascular health and pain management. Our products address the continuum of patient care from injury prevention to rehabilitation after surgery, injury or from degenerative disease, enabling people to regain or maintain their natural motion.\nOur products are used by orthopedic specialists, spine surgeons, primary care physicians, pain management specialists, physical therapists, podiatrists, chiropractors, athletic trainers and other healthcare professionals. In addition, many of our medical devices and related accessories are used by athletes and patients for injury prevention and at-home physical therapy treatment. Our product lines include rigid and soft orthopedic bracing, hot and cold therapy, bone growth stimulators, vascular therapy systems and compression garments, therapeutic shoes and inserts, electrical stimulators used for pain management and physical therapy products. Our surgical implant business offers a comprehensive suite of reconstructive joint products for the hip, knee and shoulder.\nOur products are marketed under a portfolio of brands including Aircast\u00ae, DonJoy\u00ae, Donjoy Performance\u00ae, ProCare\u00ae, CMF\u2122, Chattanooga, DJO Surgical, Dr. Comfort\u2122, Compex\u00ae, Bell-Horn\u2122 and Exos\u2122.\nOperating Segments\nThe company's continuing operations fall into four operating segments: Bracing and Vascular; Recovery Sciences; Surgical Implant; and International. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial and other additional information regarding our segments.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn June 30, 2015, our subsidiary Encore Medical, L.P., dba DJO Surgical, acquired certain assets from Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., including the Biomet Cobalt\u2122 Bone Cement, Optivac\u00ae Cement Mixing Accessories, SoftPac\u2122 Pouch and Discovery\u00ae Elbow System product lines.\nOn January 23, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Speetec Implantate GmbH ( Speetec\u201d). Speetec is a distributor and manufacturer of knee, hip and shoulder arthroplasty products in Germany.\nOn July 1, 2013 we acquired certain assets of Blue Leaf Medical CC ( Blue Leaf\u201d). The assets acquired relate to certain vascular product lines in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia.\nOn March 7, 2013 we acquired certain assets of Vasyli Medical Asia/Pacific Pty Ltd. ( Vasyli\u201d). The assets acquired relate to the distribution of certain vascular product lines in Australia and New Zealand.\nExit of Empi Business\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased manufacturing, selling and distributing products of our Empi business and the related insurance billing operations domestically. The Empi business primarily manufactured and sold TENS devices for pain relief, other electrotherapy and orthopedic products and the related supplies. Empi was facing a challenging regulatory and compliance environment, decreasing reimbursement rates and remained below the level needed to reach adequate profitability within an economically justified period of time. Empi was part of our Recovery Sciences operating segment. For financial statement purposes, the results of the Empi business are reported within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein.\nThe following table sets forth our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales ($ in thousands):\n\n (1) Cost of sales is exclusive of amortization of intangible assets of $30,719, $32,962, and $33,719 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nYear Ended December 31, 2015 (2015) Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 (2014)\nNet Sales. Net sales for 2015 were $1,113.7 million, compared to net sales of $1,087.6 million for 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which resulted in a decrease in net sales of $46.8 million, net sales increased 6.6% for the year ended 2015. Net sales from acquisitions completed in 2015 were $18.4 million. The results of the Company's non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results.\nThe following table sets forth the mix of our net sales by business segment ($ in thousands):\n\nNet sales in our Bracing and Vascular segment were $526.3 million for 2015, an increase of 4.3% from net sales of $504.6 million for 2014. The increase is primarily due to new account acquisition in our OfficeCare channel, an increase in third party payor billing and growth in sales of direct consumer products.\nNet sales in our Recovery Sciences segment were $156.2 million for 2015, a decrease of 0.8% from net sales of $157.5 million for 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by continued slow market conditions affecting the sale of Chattanooga rehabilitation equipment, together with a mix shift in bone growth stimulation products from reimbursement to direct customers. The decrease was compensated by growth in retail sales of Compex electrostimulation devices.\nNet sales in our Surgical Implant segment were $134.8 million for 2015, an increase of 34.7% from net sales of $100.1 million for 2014. The increase was driven by sales of bone cement, which was acquired with the assets purchased from Zimmer Biomet in third quarter 2015. The segment also had strong organic growth in shoulder, hip and knee products due to new product introductions and new accounts.\nNet sales in our International segment were $296.3 million for 2015, a decrease of 8.9% from net sales of $325.3 million for 2014. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $46.8 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect during 2015 compared to the rates in effect in 2014, net sales increased 5.5% for 2015 compared to 2014. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by stronger sales in direct markets, primarily Germany and Spain, and increased sales penetration in emerging markets.\nCost of Sales. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales decreased to 41.9% for 2015, compared to 42.5% for 2014 mainly due to a mix between and within the reporting segments.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A). SG&A expenses increased to $454.7 million for 2015, from $439.9 million in 2014. The increase was mainly driven by acquisition and related integrations costs in our Surgical Implant segment, variable selling expenses due to growth and legal settlements, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts due to process improvements in our reimbursement channels and a reduction in expenses related to information technology projects.\nOur SG&A expenses are impacted by significant non-recurring integration charges and other adjustments related to our ongoing restructuring activities and acquisitions. We incurred the following SG&A expenses in connection with such activities during the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nResearch and Development (R&D). R&D expenses were $35.1 million for 2015, compared to $37.3 million in 2014, or 3.2% and 3.4% of net sales, respectively. In 2014 the company incurred consulting fees for testing, documentation and software implementation to enhance new product introductions and ensure FDA compliance. The company continues to focus on the development of new products, as well as the enhancement of existing products with the latest technology and updated designs, primarily our Bracing and Vascular and Surgical Implant segments.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $80.0 million for 2015, from $83.9 million for 2014. The decrease is due to certain intangible assets reaching full amortization primarily in our patents and technology category.\nInterest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net was $172.3 million for 2015 compared to $174.3 million for 2014. The decrease is due to lower weighted average interest rates on our senior secured credit facilities.\nLoss on Modification and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2015 consists of $47.8 million in premiums related to the redemption of our 8.75% Notes, 9.875% Notes and 7.75% Notes (each as defined herein), $11.9 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our debt that was extinguished and $8.8 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2014 consists of $0.3 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment of our prior senior secured credit facilities and $0.6 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our original term loans which were extinguished.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, increased to $7.3 million for 2015 from $5.2 million for 2014. Results for both periods presented primarily represent net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Provision. For 2015, we recorded an income tax provision of $12.3 million on a pre-tax loss of $170.3 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 7.2%. For 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $4.7 million on pre-tax losses of $116.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 4.1%.\nWe recorded income tax expense, although there were pretax losses, for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily because of the existence of a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance at the beginning of the period. The income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to foreign tax expense and the accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nASC 740-20 requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other comprehensive income and items charged directly to shareholders' equity. This allocation is referred to as intra-period tax allocation. The exit from the Empi business is reported under discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly we are required to allocate the provision for income taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a gain from discontinued operations, and, as a result, we recorded a tax expense of $17.6 million in discontinued operations and a corresponding tax benefit to continuing operations. The difference between the tax expense from discontinued operations, $17.6 million, and the tax benefit reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily relates to foreign tax expense and accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDiscontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased production, selling and billing operations of our Empi product line. Loss of $157.6 million was recognized for 2015, primarily consisting of asset impairment charges, net income from Empi operations, severance and other termination costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 (2014) Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 (2013)\nNet Sales. Our net sales for 2014 were $1,087.5 million, compared to net sales of $1,020.8 million for 2013, representing a 4.6% increase year over year. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $3.0 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect in 2014 compared to the rates in effect in 2013, net sales increased 4.8%.\nThe following table sets forth the mix of our net sales by business segment ($ in thousands):\n\nNet sales in our Bracing and Vascular segment were $504.6 million for 2014, increasing 5.9% from net sales of $476.5 million for 2013. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by sales of new bracing and compression system products, as well as new account acquisition in our OfficeCare channel.\nNet sales in our Recovery Sciences segment were $157.5 million for 2014, decreasing 0.4% from net sales of $158.1 million for 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by slower than anticipated CMF product sales.\nNet sales in our Surgical Implant segment were $100.1 million for 2014, increasing 15.0% from net sales of $87.1 million for 2013. The increase was driven by strong sales of our shoulder and hip products due to new product introductions and new accounts.\nNet sales in our International segment were $325.3 million for 2014, increasing 8.8% from net sales of 299.1 million for 2013. In constant currency, excluding an unfavorable impact of $3.0 million related to changes in foreign exchange rates in effect in 2014 compared to the rates in effect in 2013, net sales for 2014 for the International segment increased 9.8% compared to net sales for 2013. Growth in net sales in this segment is being driven by sales from new products, improved sales execution, and increased sales penetration in certain geographies.\nCost of Sales. Costs of sales increased to $462.0 million for 2014, from $434.7 million for 2013. As a percentage of net sales, costs of sales remained fairly consistent at 42.5% for 2014, compared to 42.6% for 2013.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A). SG&A expenses increased to $439.9 million for 2014, from $409.2 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses remained fairly consistent at 40.5% for 2014, compared to 40.1% for 2013. The increase was driven by higher variable selling costs due to a relative increase in sales for the Bracing and Vascular and Surgical Implant segments, an increase in accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts in our reimbursement channels due to a trend in slower collections and an increase in reorganization and integration costs, offset by savings in wages and related costs of benefits.\nOur SG&A expenses are impacted by significant non-recurring integration charges and other adjustments related to our ongoing restructuring activities and acquisitions. We incurred the following SG&A expenses in connection with such activities during the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nResearch and Development (R&D). R&D expenses increased to $37.3 million for 2014, from $33.0 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expense increased to 3.4% in 2014 from 3.2% in 2013, primarily due to consulting fees for testing, documentation and software implementation to enhance new product introductions and ensure FDA compliance.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $83.9 million for 2014, from $86.4 million for 2013. The decrease is due to certain intangible assets reaching full amortization primarily in our patents and technology category, partially offset by an increase in intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of Speetec.\nInterest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net was $174.3 million for 2014 and $177.6 million for 2013. The decrease is due to lower weighted average interest rates on our senior secured credit facilities.\nLoss on Modification and Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2014 consists of $0.3 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities and $0.6 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our original term loans which were extinguished. Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for 2013 consists of $0.9 million in arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the March 2013 amendment of our senior secured credit facilities and $0.2 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with term loans which were extinguished.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net increased to $5.2 million for 2014, from $1.3 million for 2013. Results for both periods presented primarily represent net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Provision. We recorded income tax benefit of $4.7 million on pre-tax losses of $116.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 4.1% in 2014. For 2013, we recorded income tax expense of $17.5 million on pre-tax losses of $172.0 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 10.1%.\nWe recorded income tax expense, although there were pretax losses, for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily because of the existence of a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance at the beginning of the period. The income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to foreign tax expense and the accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nASC 740-20 requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other comprehensive income and items charged directly to shareholders' equity. This allocation is referred to as intra-period tax allocation. The exit from the Empi business is reported under discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly we are required to allocate the provision for income taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a gain from discontinued operations, and, as a result, we recorded a tax expense of $17.6 million in discontinued operations and a corresponding tax benefit to continuing operations. The difference between the tax expense from discontinued operations, $17.6 million, and the tax benefit reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily relates to foreign tax expense and accrual of non-cash tax expense related to an additional valuation allowance in connection with the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDiscontinued Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we ceased production, selling and billing operations of our Empi product line. Discontinued operations for 2014 consisted primarily of net income from Empi operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard provides a five-step approach to be applied to all contracts with customers. The accounting standards update also requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the standard. The guidance is now effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as early as the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have to its consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to the presentation of debt issuance costs. The standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company has early adopted this update and the impact is reflected in the current and prior periods presented.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to internal-use software. The standard provides guidance to clarify the customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This guidance does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO). The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to the adjustments. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires all deferred income taxes be presented on the balance sheet as noncurrent. The new guidance is intended to simplify financial reporting by eliminating the requirement to classify deferred taxes between current and noncurrent. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has early adopted this update and the impact is reflected prospectively in the Company's financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance retains the current accounting for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans, but requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in net income, except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation. The guidance also changes the accounting for investments without a readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient permitted by the guidance to estimate fair value. A policy election can be made for these investments whereby estimated fair value may be measured at cost and adjusted in subsequent periods for any impairment or changes in observable prices of identical or similar investments. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which affects the accounting for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The amendment also will require qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are still assessing the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our primary sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling $48.9 million and our $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which $119.5 million was available. Our revolving credit balance was $30.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and we have provided a $0.5 million letter of credit related to collateral requirements under our product liability insurance policy. Working capital at December 31, 2015 was $218.3 million.\nWe believe that our existing cash, plus the amounts we expect to generate from operations and amounts available through our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our operating needs for the next twelve months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt and interest repayment obligations. While we currently believe that we will be able to meet all of the financial covenants imposed by our senior secured credit facilities, there is no assurance that we will in fact be able to do so or that, if we do not, we will be able to obtain from our lenders waivers of default or amendments to the senior secured credit facilities.\nAs market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including Blackstone, its affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time, seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the notes and borrowings under our credit facilities, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the adjusted issue price\u201d (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.\nCash Flows\nOperating activities from continuing operations provided $9.7 million and used $7.4 million and $24.0 million of cash for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash from operating activities for all years presented primarily represented our net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital. In 2015 and 2014, changes in working capital largely consisted of increases in inventories which used cash of $8.1 million and $19.5 million, respectively and provided cash of $3.2 million in 2013. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, cash paid for interest was $176.7 million, $165.5 million and $171.4 million, respectively.\nInvesting activities from continuing operations used $68.1 million, $58.4 million, and $41.1 million of cash for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. Cash used in investing activities for 2015 was for purchases of property and equipment primarily for the acquisition\nof certain surgical assets from Zimmer Biomet, consigned surgical instruments and vascular system pumps used as rental units, IT automation technology and manufacturing equipment for new products and more efficient production. Cash used in investing activities for 2014 primarily consisted of $52.7 million for purchases of property and equipment primarily for surgical instruments to support growth, IT automation technology, manufacturing equipment for new products and more efficient production, and $4.6 million related to the acquisition of Speetec. Cash used in investing activities for 2013 primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $37.5 million primarily for surgical instruments and IT automation technology, and $2.0 million related to the acquisition of assets from our vascular distributors in Australia and South Africa.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $36.1 million in 2015, used cash of $23 thousand in 2014 and provided $23.3 million of cash in 2013, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2015 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings related to the refinancing of our debt, offset by the repayments of our prior senior secured credit facilities and our 8.75% Notes, 9.875% Notes and 7.75% Notes. Cash used in financing activities in 2014 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, offset by payments of the senior secured credit facilities, payments related to the repurchase of Rollover Options from our former chief financial officer upon her departure, and payment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Exos. Cash provided in financing activities in 2013 consisted of proceeds from the borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, offset by payments of the senior secured credit facilities.\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $2,397.4 million in aggregate indebtedness outstanding, exclusive of a net unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $42.3 million. The principal amount and carrying value of our debt was as follows for December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nCredit Facilities.\nOur credit facilities at December 31, 2015 consisted of $1,055.0 million term loans (the Term Loan\u201d) and a $150.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Facility\u201d), which mature on June 7, 2020 (collectively, the Credit Facilities\u201d). Our revolving credit balance was $30.0 million at December 31, 2015 and we have provided a $0.5 million letter of credit related to collateral requirements under our product liability insurance policy.\nWe are required to repay installments on the term loans in quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, with the remaining amount payable at maturity in June 2020.\nNotes. Our outstanding notes mature at various dates in 2020 and 2021, with $1.5 million of our 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes remaining outstanding due in 2017. Assuming we are in compliance with the terms of the indentures governing the notes, we are not required to repay principal related to any of the notes prior to their final maturity dates of the notes. We pay interest semi-annually on the notes.\nSee Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness.\nCertain Covenants and Related Compliance. Our Term Loan requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of debt from our Credit Facilities, net of cash, to Adjusted EBITDA of no higher than 5.35:1, computed on a trailing twelve month period commencing with September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL plus: net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items, as described in our Term Loan agreement. As of December 31, 2015, our actual first lien net leverage ratio was 4.15:1, meeting the requirement.\nOur debt agreements restrict our ability to incur additional debt and make certain payments. The indentures for our Notes generally permit additional debt only if the ratio of our Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges is at least 2.00:1, or, in the case of additional debt to finance an acquisition, such ratio improves on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such incurrence. Our Credit Facilities permit us to incur additional debt for an acquisition only if the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to debt, net of cash, improves or is no higher than 7.50:1, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to acquisition and additional debt. The indentures for our Notes generally prevent us from making certain payments, such as dividends and junior debt prepayments, unless the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges is at least 2.00:1 on a pro forma basis. Our ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was 1.49:1. Fixed charges, as defined in the indentures, generally means consolidated interest expense plus all cash dividends or other distributions paid on equity.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income (loss) or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in our debt agreements allows us to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net loss. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.\nAs described above, our Credit Facilities and Notes represent significant components of our capital structure. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Credit Facilities and Notes. If we fail to comply with the leverage and other requirements of our Credit Facilities and Notes, we would be in default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders and the trustee for the Notes could, subject to certain provisions described in the agreements by which we can cure the default, declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. Our ability to meet the covenants described in our Credit Facilities and Notes will depend on future events, some of which are beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those covenants.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from our net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The terms and related calculations are defined in the credit agreement relating to our senior secured credit facilities and the Indentures.\n\n (a) Non-cash items are comprised of the following: \n\n (1) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of $49.6 million related to the Chattanooga reporting unit. The impairment charge resulted from reductions in our projected operating results and estimated future cash flows due to slow market conditions for capital equipment. \n (2) Purchase accounting adjustments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $0.8 million of amortization of fair market value inventory adjustments. Purchase accounting adjustments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 consist of $0.2 million of amortization of fair market value inventory adjustments, net of $1.5 million in adjustments to the contingent consideration for Speetec. Purchase accounting adjustments for 2013 consist of $0.9 million of amortization of fair market value inventory adjustments, net of $2.5 million in adjustments to the contingent consideration for Exos. \n (b) Non-recurring and integration charges are comprised of the following: \n\n (1) Consists of direct acquisition costs and integration expenses related to acquired businesses and costs related to potential acquisitions \n (2) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, litigation and regulatory costs consisted of $3.5 million in litigation costs related to ongoing product liability issues and $5.4 million related to other litigation and regulatory costs and settlements. \n (3) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, litigation and regulatory costs consisted of $0.9 million in litigation costs related to ongoing product liability issues related to our discontinued pain pump products and $4.9 million related to other litigation and regulatory costs and settlements. \n (4) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, litigation and regulatory costs consisted of $3.1 million in litigation costs related to ongoing product liability issues related to our discontinued pain pump products, $3.7 million related to other litigation and regulatory costs and settlements, net of $2.0 million received related to an indemnity claim from a third party pain pump manufacturer and a settlement with its insurance carrier, and a $0.9 million favorable cost estimate adjustment for the post-market surveillance study required by the FDA related to our discontinued metal-on-metal hip implant products. \n (5) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, other non-recurring items consisted of $4.2 million in specifically identified non-recurring operational and regulatory projects. \n (6) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, other non-recurring items consisted of $13.7 million in specifically identified non-recurring operational and regulatory projects, $2.2 million in expenses related to our Tunisia factory fire and $2.7 million in professional fees and other non-recurring charges. \n (7) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, other non-recurring items consisted of $1.9 million in specifically identified non-recurring operational and regulatory projects, $0.9 million in expenses related to our Tunisia factory fire and $1.9 million in other non-recurring travel & professional fees. \n (c) Other adjustment items before permitted pro forma adjustments are comprised of the following: \n\n (1) Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for the twelve months ending December 31, 2015 consisted of $47.8 million in premiums related to the redemption of our 8.75% Notes, 9.875% Notes and 7.75% Notes, $11.9 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our debt that was extinguished and $8.8 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing. \n (2) Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for the twelve months ending December 31, 2014 consists of $0.3 million of arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities and $0.6 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the portion of our original term loans which were extinguished. \n (3) Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt for the twelve months ending December 31, 2013 consists of $0.9 million in arrangement and amendment fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the March 2013 amendment of our senior secured credit facilities and $0.2 million related to the non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with term loans which were extinguished. \n (4) Other adjustments consist primarily of net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. \n (d) Permitted pro forma adjustments include future cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the exit of our Empi business. \nContractual Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, our consolidated contractual commitments are as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) $1,315.0 million principal amount of long-term debt is subject to fixed interest rates and $1,082.3 million of principal amount of long-term debt is subject to a floating interest rate. Interest payments for the floating rate debt were determined using an average assumed effective interest rate of 4.25%, which is equal to the average assumed effective interest rate for the term loans under the credit facilities over the remainder of their term. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had entered into purchase commitments for inventory, capital expenditures and other services totaling $69.5 million in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under the amended transaction and monitoring fee agreement entered into in November 2007, the purchase obligations shown above include DJO's obligation to pay a $7.0 million annual monitoring fee to Blackstone Management Partners V L.L.C. through 2019. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\u201d for a more detailed description of the monitoring fee agreement.\nThe amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirement because the actual timing of future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to reserves for contractual allowances, doubtful accounts, rebates, product returns, goodwill and intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities and inventory. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent that actual events differ from our estimates and assumptions, there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations.\nReserves for Contractual Allowances, Doubtful Accounts, Rebates, Product Returns\nWe have established reserves to account for contractual allowances, doubtful accounts, rebates and product returns. Significant management judgment must be used and estimates must be made in connection with establishing these reserves.\nWe maintain provisions for estimated contractual allowances for reimbursement amounts from our third party payor customers based on negotiated contracts and historical experience for non-contracted payors. We report these allowances as reductions to our gross revenue. We estimate the amount of the reduction based on historical experience and invoices generated in the period, and we consider the impact of new contract terms or modifications of existing arrangements with our customers. We have contracts with certain third party payors for our third party reimbursement billings, which call for specified reductions in reimbursement of billed amounts based upon contractual reimbursement rates. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reserved for and reduced gross revenues from third party payors by estimated contractual allowances of 36%, 35%, and 40%, respectively.\nOur reserve for doubtful accounts is based upon estimated losses from customers who are billed directly and the portion of third party reimbursement billings that ultimately become the financial responsibility of the end user patients. Direct-billed customers represented approximately 66%, 66%, and 73% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Direct-billed customers represented approximately 64% and 67% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We experienced write-offs related to direct-billed customers of less than 1% of related net revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOur third party reimbursement customers including insurance companies, managed care companies and certain governmental payors, such as Medicare, include all of our OfficeCare customers, most of our Empi customers, and certain other customers of our Recovery Sciences and Bracing and Vascular segments. Our third party payor customers represented approximately 34%, 34%, and 27% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Third party payor customers represented approximately 36% and 33%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we estimate bad debt expense to be approximately 6% of gross revenues from these third party reimbursement customers. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if third party payors were to deny claims for late filings, incomplete information or other reasons, additional provisions may be required. Additions to this reserve are reflected as Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur reserve for rebates accounts for incentives that we offer certain of our distributors. These rebates are substantially attributable to sales volume, sales growth or to reimburse the distributor for certain discounts. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebate programs based upon historical experience and estimated revenue levels.\nOur reserve for product returns accounts for estimated customer returns of our products after purchase. These returns are mainly attributable to a third party payor's refusal to provide reimbursement for the product or the inability of the product to adequately address the patient's condition. We provide for this reserve by reducing gross revenue based on our historical rate of returns.\nInventory Reserves\nWe provide reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories on hand and the costs of projected inventories required based upon assumptions about future demand. If future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We also provide reserves for newer product inventories, as appropriate, based on any minimum purchase commitments and our level of sales of the new products.\nWe consign a portion of our inventory to allow our products to be immediately dispensed to patients. This requires inventory to be on hand for the products we sell through consignment arrangements. It also increases the sensitivity of these products to obsolescence reserve estimates. As this inventory is not in our possession, we maintain additional reserves for estimated shrinkage of these inventories based on the results of periodic inventory counts and historical trends.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.\nIn performing our 2015 goodwill impairment test, we estimated the fair values of our reporting units using the income approach which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which includes the use of market multiples. These fair value measurements are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes, and required significant judgment with respect to forecasted sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, income taxes, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. For purposes of calculating the discounted cash flows of our reporting units, we used estimated revenue growth rates averaging between 1% and 15% for the discrete forecast period. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies. Future cash flows were then discounted to present value at discount rates ranging from 8.9% to 10.6%, and terminal value growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. Publicly available information regarding comparable market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow\nmethodology. We determined that the fair value of the six reporting units with goodwill assigned to them exceeds their carrying value and no reporting unit was at risk of failing the test. The percentage by which the fair value of the six reporting units exceeded their carrying value ranged from 31.4% to 133.5%. As such, we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015 we tested our indefinite lived trade name intangible assets for impairment. This test work compares the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. To determine the fair value we applied the relief from royalty (RFR) method. Under the RFR method, the value of the trade name is determined by calculating the present value of the after-tax cost savings associated with owning the asset and therefore not being required to pay royalties for its use during the asset's indefinite life. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating future cash flows and the identification of appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the projected future cash generated by the respective intangible assets. Future cash flows were discounted to present value at discount rates ranging from 8.9% to 10.6%, and terminal value growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. Also subject to judgment are assumptions about royalty rates, which are based on the estimated rates at which similar brands and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace. We used market average royalty rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.0%. These fair value measurements are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We determined that that the fair value of these trade names exceed their carrying value. The percentage by which the fair value of these trade names exceeded their carrying value ranged from 24.0% to 160.1%. As such, we determined that these indefinite lived intangible assets are not impaired.\nThe estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business, however, it is possible that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur significant impairment charges.\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets, liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards. We establish valuation allowances when the recovery of a deferred tax asset is not likely based on historical income, projected future income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies.\nWe generated additional deferred tax liabilities related to tax amortization of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets because these assets were not amortized for financial reporting purposes. The tax amortization in current and future years gives rise to a deferred tax liability which will only reverse at the time of ultimate sale or book impairment. Due to the uncertain timing of this reversal, the temporary differences associated with indefinite lived intangibles cannot be considered a source of future taxable income for purposes of determining a valuation allowance. As such, the deferred tax liability cannot be used to offset the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss carry forward for tax purposes that is generated by the same amortization. This naked credit\u201d gives rise to the need for additional valuation allowance.\nOur gross deferred tax asset balance was $327.7 million at December 31, 2015 and is primarily related to reserves for accounts receivable and inventory, accrued expenses, and net operating loss carryforwards (see Note 15 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, herein). As of December 31, 2015, we maintained a valuation allowance of $223.4 million due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize certain deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance maintained is primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards not expected to be realized.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables":
